article Many thousands of others have risked their lives this year, fleeing conflict and instability in Africa and the Middle East, in small, often decrepit vessels in an attempt to reach European territories.
But the number of fatalities has risen dramatically in a matter of months. More than 2,200 lives have been lost since June, the UN refugee agency UNHCR believes.
That is because of the big increase in numbers crossing the Mediterranean. While some 60,000 reached European shores in 2013, so far more than 130,000 have arrived in 2014.
The majority of migrants head for Italy, prompting a crisis that the country's navy, coast guard and beleaguered immigration facilities are struggling to handle.
Last October, 366 people died off the Italian island of Lampedusa when the fishing boat they were travelling in from Libya capsized.
Nearly all the victims were Eritrean. Migrants crossing in the central Mediterranean - from Libya and Tunisia - have until recently come mostly from Eritrea and Somalia, although increasing numbers of Syrians fleeing the country's civil war are also making the journey.
Libya has become a popular starting point for many journeys, with people traffickers exploiting the country's power vacuum and increasing lawlessness.
The relatively short distance to Lampedusa encourages more people to risk the journey.
Migration charities believe that as many as 20,000 people may have died at sea trying to reach Europe in the last two decades.
Malta's prime minister warned after the Lampedusa tragedy that the Mediterranean was in danger of becoming of a "cemetery" for desperate migrants.
'Age-old' issue
The number of people using the various routes across the Mediterranean has ebbed and flowed.
From 2008-2012, large numbers of migrants crossed between Turkey and Greece via the so-called Eastern Mediterranean route, border management agency Frontex reports.
In response, Greece bolstered border controls with an additional 1,800 police officers.
However, Frontex suggests that the area remains problematic, and points to "uncertainties related to the sustainability of [Greek] efforts, and evidence that migrants are waiting in Turkey for the end of the operation".
Over the last decade, the central Mediterranean route has experienced periodic surges in migrant traffic.
UNHCR figures suggest that some 25,000 people fled to Italy from North Africa in 2005, a number which dwindled to 9,573 in 2009.
In 2011, this figure rocketed back to some 61,000, driven by the conflict in Libya which culminated in the downfall of Col Gaddafi.
Earlier in the decade, the most popular route was from West Africa to Spain, including its North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla, and the Canary Islands, with some 32,000 irregular arrivals in 2006. This figure had dwindled to just 5,443 by 2011.

article Full-back Halfpenny, 26, is out of contract with Toulon at the end of the season and is weighing up his options.
Blues coach Danny Wilson says they cannot offer the highest wages but would be able to ensure Halfpenny is in "peak" condition for Wales.
"The best interests of the player internationally would be at the front of our minds," said Wilson.
Halfpenny, who made 87 appearances for the Blues between 2008 and 2014 , would be a strong contender for a national dual contract (NDC) if he returned to Wales after spending two years in France.
The salary on such a deal would be funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), with the region paying the rest.
In return for the financial support, the regions agree to limit the number of appearances the player makes to suit the needs of the national side.
Wilson believes the prospect of being managed in that way would be a major attraction for Halfpenny, whose career has been blighted by injury, including missing the recent Rugby World Cup.
"The design of the central [NDC] contract is to get our best players playing and staying in Wales, and therefore the management of those players has to be a huge selling point," he said.
"Between us and the strong relationship with the Welsh Rugby Union, the player gets the management he wants to peak and perform for Wales.
"That's the idea of it and that has to be a selling point from a regional relationship. The other selling point we don't have is the same money as other people have to offer."
Scarlets have also voiced their interest in the British and Irish Lion, while Premiership side Wasps have been strongly linked.
Both are likely to be involved in the top tier of European competition next season, the Champions Cup, whereas the Blues are set to be in the second tier Challenge Cup.
If Halfpenny wants to return to Wales, the binding agreement between the WRU and the Welsh regions gives the Blues first refusal as the region that developed him.
"If Leigh does make a decision he wants to come back to Wales, I'd like to think Cardiff Blues would be high on his list of considerations," said Wilson.
"I'd imagine all four regions would like to have Leigh Halfpenny playing for them.
"A calibre of player like Leigh Halfpenny will have many options, whether that's regions, clubs over the bridge, clubs in France.
"There are a number of players we are talking to - players we are in the process of finalising conversations with and we'll see how things pan out."
summary Toulon have announced their plans to sign Welsh international Ryan Halfpenny.

article The claim: The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables.
Reality Check verdict: This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources.
It came after he had said: "If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed."
Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in a speech in February as being a "patriotic endeavour".
The manifesto says the party would: "Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030."
A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as "visionary as opposed to completely literal".
The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy.
The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient.
There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors.
It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it.
While there have been suggestions that marine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage.
The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system.
Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it.
So in 2016, the UK generated 24.4% of its electricity from renewables, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing 8.8% of energy from renewables.
The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive 30% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve.
The Labour manifesto pledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030.
The Conservative manifesto looks at it in a different way, saying that "energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives".
So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, "reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change".
The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating.
It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

article That follows an admission by VW that it had found "irregularities" in carbon dioxide emissions levels that could affect 800,000 vehicles.
It came to light as a result of an internal investigation by the firm following the diesel emissions scandal.
The UK said it was "pressing VW to provide urgent clarity".
On Tuesday, the company admitted that an internal investigation had revealed that carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption were understated during standards tests on about 800,000 cars.
VW said the issue mainly affected diesel cars.
However, on Wednesday Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the country's parliament:
"Today we were told that among the affected vehicles are 98,000 petrol vehicles".
Meanwhile the UK's Department for Transport said it "takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously."
"We are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation... This [CO2] development underlines the importance of the government's ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used," a spokesperson said.
VW, Skoda, Audi and Seat vehicles could be affected and the company estimates the CO2 problem could cost it about ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.4bn).
VW had already set aside ‚Ç¨6.7bn (¬£4.7bn) to meet the cost of the initial emissions scandal.
News of the issue with carbon dioxide emissions sent VW shares down by 5.6% on Wednesday.
The firm's shares have lost about a third of their value since September, when the scandal first broke.
It came to light after the US Environmental Protection Agency found VW software had detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions tests, and altered the way they operated to give more favourable results.
On Monday, US authorities also alleged that VW had fitted nitrogen oxide defeat devices on 3.0 litre diesel engines used in Porsche, Audi and VW vehicles - a claim VW denied.
Porsche also denied the allegations, but its North American division announced it is discontinuing sales of Porsche Cayenne diesel sport utility vehicles until further notice.
The carmaker is recalling 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide that were fitted with the software that circumvented tests for emissions of nitrogen oxide.
That recall is for cars with variants of the EA 189 diesel engine built to the "Euro 5" emissions standard.
Meanwhile. Volkswagen is recalling 92,000 cars in the US over a mechanical problem that could affect vehicles' brakes.
The German carmaker said part of the camshaft could shear off, causing loss of vacuum in the power brakes, which could lengthen stopping distances.
Wednesday's recall includes Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat models from 2015 and 2016. The cars have 1.8 litre and 2 litre turbocharged petrol engines.
VW discovered the problem after getting reports of camshaft failures. A fix is expected by the end of March.
summary VW has admitted that it has found "irregularities" in its emissions tests.

article The US banking giant said net income in its corporate and investment banking division was $2.5bn, up $412m compared with the same period a year earlier.
But it also reported an after-tax charge of $487m for legal expenses.
And it set aside a total of $959m to cover bad loans, $109m higher than a year earlier.
JPMorgan's legal expenses stem in part from the fact that it still faces an investigation by the US Justice Department into its involvement in the manipulation of foreign exchange markets.
It also faces a probe into its hiring policy in Asia.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the US, reported a 2.6% fall in profits in the first three months of the year and set aside more money to cover bad loans.
Net income was $5.46bn in the three months to the end of March ,compared with $5.61bn a  year earlier.
The bank said it was setting aside $617m for credit losses an increase of $198m on the same three months a year earlier.
JPMorgan said revenue from fixed-income bond trading rose 5% to $4.07bn, adjusted for the sale of businesses last year, including a commodities operation.
"We have an outstanding franchise which is getting safer and stronger, and is gaining market share over time," said chief executive Jamie Dimon.
"We continue to build the company for the long-term, we are investing in controls, infrastructure, systems, technology, new products and bankers."
The bank said it was increasing its second quarter dividend from $0.40 to $0.44.
JPMorgan's investment bank, along with its rivals, is under pressure to cut costs as customers have reduced their trading activity following the financial crisis.
Regulators have also demanded that big banks take fewer risks, hold more capital and improve controls.
The bank has said it wants to cut expenses by $2.8bn by 2017, excluding legal costs, though some of the savings are expected to be offset by more spending to improve risk controls.
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are the first of the large US banks to report quarterly results.
Overall, results are expected to show that low interest rates have continued to hold down profits as consumers and businesses refinance loans at lower rates.
summary Credit Suisse has reported a record quarterly profit.

article Elsewhere there's some significant action on the committee corridor, with quite a collection of Cabinet ministers appearing before various committees.
As the current crop of bills before Parliament peters out, the committee corridor may well become the focus of attention for the coming months, particularly with 30 select committee inquiries into various Brexit-related topics now under way.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - with any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions following at 3.30pm.
The main legislating is on the Digital Economy Bill, where there are some significant issues in play at report stage.
The government has accepted an important amendment from the former minister Claire Perry, who had heavyweight cross party backing for her call to add powers to the bill allowing the government to make internet service providers block porn websites that failed to comply with a requirement for age verification for their viewers.
The argument was that this was needed to give real teeth to the bill, and it has now been accepted by ministers, who're bringing in their own version of these powers, in a government amendment.
Labour, though, have reservations about the new government proposal and may even vote against it. And they argue that the best defence for children is compulsory sex education, starting at Key Stage 1, and will be pushing an amendment to that effect.
Watch out too for a Labour new clause, which seeks to create a procedure to deal with the growing problems of breaches of personal data security. This would create an obligation on data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner and those whose details had been compromised.
Labour also want to add in new laws to combat ticket touts and they will also be opposing the clauses transferring the policy over free BBC licence fees for the over-75s to the BBC, on the argument that the Corporation is not the appropriate body to take decisions on welfare policy. They plan to force that issue to a vote.
The Westminster Hall debate (4.30pm- 7.30pm) is on e-petition 162934 relating to child cancer - which calls on the government to make more funding available in the fight against child cancer.
The debate will be led by the Conservative, Ben Howlett, who said the petition had been brought by a couple whose child sadly passed away after a battle with a very rare cancer. Childhood cancer is the biggest killer by disease of children in the western world and currently the survival rates vary considerably between different types of cancer, age and gender. He wants to urge the government to do more to look at the funding for both research and testing new drugs for childhood cancer as well as new awareness campaigns aimed at parents.
Committee of the day is the Transport Committee hearing (4.05pm) on rail safety, which will ponder the issues around rising passenger numbers and problems, with the Rail Delivery Group, the Rail Safety and Standards Broad (RSSB) as well as the ASLEF, RMT and Unite trade unions.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) peers have another day debating the Pension Schemes Bill at committee stage - key issues include more on Master Trusts and on private pension scheme exit fees.
And the Lib Dem peer, Lord Alderdice, leads a debate on ensuring parity of esteem between mental and physical health.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Treasury questions - followed by the day's Ten Minute Rule Bill which is on Statutory Nuisance (Aircraft Noise) -  fresh from a Westminster Hall debate on this issue, Dr Tania Mathias, whose constituency lies under the Heathrow flightpath, takes her battle against a third runway to the floor of the Commons chamber.
That is followed by the second reading of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill - a two-clause micro-measure which will raise the limit on government financial assistance that can be provided to CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation) (the "CDC") to √Ç¬£6bn.
This could be a micro-second reading debate as well - leaving time for opposed private business - a number of private bills (bills dealing with a private interest) have popped up from time to time, for formal approval, only to be pulled when backbench vigilantes like Christopher Chope threaten to object to them. The aim of these challengers it to get the measures debated - and this may now occur.
In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by the debate led by Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts, on CCTV in equine slaughterhouses (2.30pm-4pm).
My committee pick is the Justice Committee hearing (9.45pm) with Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah and Michael Spurr, Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service. The current state of the prison system can hardly be avoided. Unusually this inquiry begins, rather than ends with a hearing with a minister - and its focus could well branch out in several directions, as the hearings continue.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Public Health England and NHS officials give evidence to the Health Committee on suicide prevention and whether there is sufficient support for mental health in the NHS (2.30pm).
And there's an interesting in-house encounter - the Standards Committee hearing (10am) on the MPs' Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules. The witnesses include the MPs' main shop stewards: Graham Brady,  Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee; John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the SNP; plus Bernard Jenkin, Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee; Dr Sarah Wollaston, Chair of the Health Committee, and backbench standards crusader, John Mann, one of the most active complainants on standards issues (at 10.50am).
In the Lords (2.30pm) the main debate is on the economy, in the light of the Autumn Statement.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with half an hour of Welsh questions, followed at noon by PMQs.
Then, the Labour MP Justin Madders proposes a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make it easier for young people to go to games; his Football Supporters (Access) Bill deals with ticket prices and kick off times and calls for a proportion of transfer fees to be earmarked to develop facilities for local clubs and young people.
The day's main debate will be on an SNP motion - subject to be announced - and there's an intriguing looking adjournment debate from the SNP's Gavin Newlands, on Paisley's cultural contribution to the world.
And Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green will be questioned (9.30am) by the Work and Pensions Committee about his department's finances, after the cash injection in the Autumn Statement.
My other committee pick is Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's appearance before the Environmental Audit Committee (2.20pm), to talk about the environmental concerns around Heathrow expansion and the plans to mitigate air pollution, carbon emissions and noise from a new runway.
In the Lords (3pm) the main legislation is the first report stage day on the Policing and Crime Bill - this measure will probably provide the Lords' last serious legislative clashes of 2016.
There are some big issues to be fought out.
First, behind the scenes negotiations are under way to find a compromise on the provision for Police and Crime Commissioner to take over the fire and rescue authority for their area. Labour have an amendment down to delete this entire section of the bill (Clause 6), but could well be dissuaded if the government is prepared to offer stricter requirements for local consultation on such proposals - and a new government amendment on this issue has now appeared.
Compromise is less likely on Labour amendments to prevent Special Constables using CS gas and PAVA sprays, and this may be forced to a vote. There will also be an amendment on restriction on the use of police cells for those with mental health conditions
But the biggest clash may be over an attempt to add in a requirement to hold a Leveson 2-style inquiry into relations between the police and the media - as I write, no amendment has appeared but one is expected, probably fronted by a crossbench peer, but with substantial cross party support.
If passed it would probably occasion an awkward bout of parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons. And there will be plenty more controversial amendments on the next day of report stage...
As ever, on report stage days in the Lords, timing is important, and opposition amendments usually stand less chance if they're debated after the dinner break, when a lot of peers go home.
There will also be a short debate on current UK political strategy towards and plans to develop economic, security and cultural relations with Tunisia.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, David Lidington, setting out what will be on the Commons agenda in the coming weeks.
The day's main debates are on subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee. First is a debate on a motion on transgender equality: Maria Miller, Angela Crawley which will follow up on the first report of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, which looked at this issue.
That's followed by a general debate on the future of the UK fishing industry. An annual fisheries debate used to be a fixture of the parliamentary calendar, but since the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, the subject has had to take its chances along with many others.
In the Lords (11am) the main debates are on options for the UK's future relationship with the EU following the referendum - led by Lord Liddle, Tony Blair's former EU advisor, and on challenges in the current system of social care, proposals for reviewing and longer-term reform - led by Labour's Baroness Pitkeathley, a former chief executive of Carers National Association (now Carers UK).
The final debate is on the EU net-neutrality Connected Continent requirements, UK adult content filtering regimes and keeping children safe online.
It's private members' bills day in the Commons (9.30am) and first up is the second reading of the SNP MP Mhairi Black's Benefit Claimants Sanctions (Required Assessment) Bill, which aims to build new safeguards into the system under which claimants can be "fined" if they fail, for example, to attend a job interview.
She wants the system to take into account any caring or childcare responsibilities, the mental and physical health of the claimant and their housing situation, and to ensure that any claimants who are sanctioned are made aware of any emergency funding they could access. Expect a strong turnout of SNP MPs, but there is little sign of support from the government.
Then comes the Vehicle Noise Limits (Enforcement) Bill - from the Conservative, Kevin Foster. The bill would allow noise limits to be enforced via automatic monitoring equipment.
Further down the agenda lurks Ruth Cadbury's Income Tax (Non-Military Expenditure) Bill, which would require HMRC to record income tax revenue of people who say they have a 'conscientious objection' to public spending on defence purposes and to direct their taxes that would have been spent on the military to a 'non-military security fund'.
As the third bill on the Order Paper, it has little chance of any extensive debate.
In the Lords (10am) it's the annual Friday where the bishops get to debate the subject of their choice.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, leads a debate on the "Shared values underpinning our national life and their role in shaping public policy priorities".
Archbishop Welby has had some pretty interesting things to say on this subject - a few extracts from a recent speech give a flavour of the ground he may cover:
"It is imperative that we remind the nation that our values have not emerged within a secular vacuum; but from the resilient and eternal structure of our Judeo-Christian theological, philosophical and ethical heritage. ....The right to life, liberty and the rule of law and robust democratic government does not come cheaply, nor is it held lightly. The roots of our freedom in this country are deeply embedded within our British constitutional and civic life because their foundation lies within the shared scriptural inheritance of our faith traditions.....Democracy is not in and of itself the final answer to things, nor is the rule of law. Martin Luther King did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law is unjust. Quite rightly, Bonhoeffer in the 1930s did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law was palpably racist, unjust and anti-Semitic. That's one of the reasons he ended up going to the gallows. As for tolerance, it's a word like 'nice', isn't it? Completely meaningless and overused. Respect is something else - I won't go there.....Our understanding of the rights and responsibilities that flow from our God-given inheritance as human beings, enable us - Jewish and Christian communities together - to be powerful and compelling advocates for freedom in British society.
"The cutting edge of freedom must include the right to disagree, disengage and dissent. It means the freedom of others to criticise us or our views, or for those of us who hold beliefs strongly to change our minds or our beliefs. It means that we all need to be accountable to one another before God and we all need to affirm the right of others to not believe as we do. What it doesn't mean is freedom without accountability to undermine each other's faith, whether casually, incidentally or wilfully. What it cannot mean is the freedom to use language destructively and negatively about those who are different to us - or who take opinions and views with which we profoundly disagree. We have had egregious examples of that in recent weeks, aimed at our judiciary. And what it must never mean is the denial of others to practise or not practise their understanding of their religious or secular identity."
summary The House of Commons is due to vote on a number of bills this week.

All four semi-finalists in Kazakhstan qualify for August's Olympics.
Middleweight Savannah Marshall became the 10th British boxer to book a place in Brazil by outpointing Chinese third seed Li Qian in her quarter-final bout.
Taylor, 29, who is guaranteed at least a bronze medal, impressed in Tuesday's quarter-final with a clinical display and is aiming for a sixth world title.
The Bray boxer beat Agnes Alexiusson of Sweden and Argentina's Dayana Sanchez in Astana before prevailing against Torres over four rounds.
Taylor was surprisingly beaten in the Olympic qualifier in Turkey last month.
Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna handed Taylor her first defeat in five years at the European Olympic qualifiers to leave the five-time world champion still seeking Rio qualification.
Alekseevna's victory in Samsun was Taylor's first defeat in 63 contests.
Meanwhile, Marshall, 25, will next face Dutch fighter Nouchka Fontijn for a place in the final.
Compatriot Nicola Adams kept on track for the first world gold of her career as she squeezed through against Yu-Ting Lin of Chinese Taipei in their flyweight bout.

article West Midlands Police outlined the measures - which will mainly affect community support officers - as part of its efforts to save ??130m.
Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said further cuts of up to ??30m were likely to follow.
The Home Office said crime was down 16% in the region.
West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims said: "We will continue to offer the protection we currently offer but people will notice the service is delivered differently.
"There will be less visibility on the streets, fewer bobbies on the beat."
Shale Ahmed from the Aspire and Succeed Youth Centre in Lozells said the changes could be "devastating".
"For a neighbourhood like this, it's about community safety," he said.
Ravi Subramanian, from the union Unison, which represents some police staff, said the service had already suffered job losses. "This further reduction will mean a scaling back of neighbourhood policing."
Mr Jamieson said: "The West Midlands has seen 24% cuts - that isn't right.
"Last week we heard there could be another ??20-30m cuts on top of this. What we cannot do is do what we were doing before.
"We are going to lose up to half of our budget by 2020.
"What people must realise is that government austerity could have a severe effect on the quality of policing.
"It's going to be policing without frills. I'm afraid it could be like some of the European forces, where it's just response policing and the other excellent work our police do could be seriously diluted."
However, the Home Office said: "There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work.
"What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.
summary West Midlands Police have announced a ¬£130,000 funding boost to the police force.

article The SNP said the Ipsos Mori survey for STV was a "sensational" endorsement.
The poll also indicated that the Nationalists would win next May's Holyrood election with 74 seats.
Scottish Labour said it was focusing on what mattered and the Scottish Tories said they would continue to make a positive case for the UK.
The survey, which questioned 1,002 people last week, comes almost a year after Scotland rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%.
It is thought to be the first poll to show a majority for "Yes" among all those questioned.
Previous polls in the run-up to the September 2014 vote that showed a majority for independence had excluded those who were undecided.
Half of those questioned for STV said they would like to see another referendum within five years while 58% said they would be in favour of having one in the next 10 years.
Support for the SNP continues to be high in the wake of the party's landslide general election victory north of the border, winning 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats.
The poll found that 55% of those who gave a voting intention would back the Nationalists in the Scottish Parliament constituency vote if the election was held tomorrow.
About a fifth (21%) would vote Labour, with support for the Tories at 12%, Liberal Democrats at 7% and Greens at 3%.
In the list vote, SNP support fell to 50% and backing for the Greens rose to 8%, with the preferences for the other parties remaining the same.
The SNP's business convener Derek Mackay said: "This is a sensational poll for the SNP - it shows not only that people across Scotland support us in huge and growing numbers eight years into government, but that they believe we have a strong record on key issues like health and education."
He added: "It is welcome to see support for independence now stands at over 50 per cent, as people see the SNP in government and at Westminster stand up for Scotland."
A Scottish Labour spokesman said that the party, under the new leadership of Kezia Dugdale, was changing.
He added: "We want people to take another look at Scottish Labour.
"But we know it's too early to be asking people for their votes.
"Over the coming months, we will put Labour's values first and we will focus on the things that matter in people's lives - like the standards in our schools and our hospitals."
The Scottish Conservative Party said it would "always stand up for" the two million people in Scotland who voted "No" in last year's referendum.
A spokesman added: "For its part, rather than revelling in this poll, the SNP needs to focus on the day job.
"While the Scottish government takes Scotland down the constitutional cul-de-sac, education standards have fallen and the police service set up by this SNP government just two years ago is facing breakdown.
"Scotland needs a better way forward, not a step back to yet another referendum."
The pollsters interviewed 1002 people between the 24 and 30 August.  The margin of error was plus or minus three.
summary The Scottish National Party has said it will support the SNP in the forthcoming general election.

article Mr Wilson was 21 when he went missing from his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast in 1973.
He is believed to have been abducted and murdered by the IRA.
On Tuesday, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said results of DNA tests confirmed the remains were Mr Wilson's.
His body will now be released to his family.
Members of the Wilson family had just attended a walk at Stormont in memory of the Disappeared on 2 November when a call came through to say his remains had been found.
His sister, Anne Connolly, said it was a shock to learn recently that he might be buried in Waterfoot as her mother, Lily, who died three years ago, often sat on village beach.
She spoke of a "mixture of relief, and great sadness" to learn that his body had been found so soon after the dig began.
Archaeologists and other experts had been examining the beach at Waterfoot in the Glens of Antrim after a tip-off to the ICLVR.
The commission has now overseen the discovery of seven bodies and numerous searches since it was set up in 1999 to locate those murdered and buried in secret graves by republican paramilitaries during the troubles.
Remains found in County Monaghan in July were confirmed as being those of Crossmaglen man Charlie Armstrong, a 57-year-old father-of-five who went missing on his way to Mass in 1981.
In October, the remains of Mr Armstrong's neighbour, Gerry Evans, were found at a site in County Louth.

article The researchers found that pandas get by on shoots and leaves because they expend extremely small amounts of energy.
A typical adult panda burns up about 38% of the calories used by other, similarly sized animals.
The scientists found the bears' slow-moving ways were linked to low levels of thyroid hormones.
Scientists have long been intrigued as to how the black and white mammals are able to live exclusively on hard-to-digest bamboo, since their stomachs still retain the gut bacteria of the omnivorous creatures they evolved from.
This new analysis sheds light on the mystery.
The researchers looked at the daily energy expenditure of five captive pandas and three living in the wild.
They found that the creatures used around 38% of the predicted value for mammals of their size. This compares to slow-moving koalas, which use around 69% of the energy normal for similarly sized animals.
The most direct comparison with the pandas' laid-back ways were three-toed sloths, which have a similarly minimal energy consumption for their size.
When the researchers measured the panda's rates of movement they found they were only active 49% of the time, and when they did move, their average speed was a less-than-blistering 20 metres per hour.
"Pandas save a lot of energy by being frugal with the energy they spend on physical activity," said Prof John Speakman, from the University of Aberdeen and Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the study's lead authors.
"However, it is not only their low activity that contributes to their low metabolism; the metabolic rate of an active panda is still lower than a completely stationary human.
"We found that their low metabolism is correlated with very low levels of thyroid hormones, which was linked to a genetic mutation in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway that is unique to the panda."
These hormone levels were the equivalent to those found in hibernating black bears.
Pandas in captivity were even less inclined to move about, rising off their bottoms for only about one third of the time they were studied.
The researchers also discovered that the panda's brain, liver and kidneys are relatively small compared to other bears.
According to WWF, there are around 1,800 pandas left in the wild in China.
The findings were reported in the journal Science.

article The aero-engine maker, which depends on oil and gas-related customers for about 60% of its business, blamed the sharp fall in crude prices for the cuts.
The marine unit has been under pressure over the past 18 months since the price of Brent crude collapsed to six-year lows, and ship orders were cancelled.
The marine business employs about 5,800 people in 34 countries.
Rolls Royce shares jumped more than 3% following the announcement.
Mikael Makinen, Rolls-Royce Marine president, said: "After many years of strong performance through to 2013, led by good growth in the oil and gas sector, our order book and profitability have been adversely impacted by the sharp and subsequently prolonged drop in the price of oil."
The cuts will mainly be in management and back office roles, a spokesman said.
"We will be consulting with our employees and their representatives over the coming weeks and months, and expect the reduction to be completed by the end of 2016," he added.
The firm expects the cuts will generate full year savings of ¬£40m. Investment into research and development will be stepped up.
Last November, the company said it would cut its headcount by 2,600 jobs, mainly in its aerospace division.
In July, Rolls-Royce issued its fourth profit warning in 18 months on the back of the drop in oil prices.
It said its 2015 underlying profit in the marine business would be between break even and ¬£40m, rather than between ¬£90m and ¬£120m.
Rolls-Royce's new chief executive Warren East, who took up the role at the beginning of July, is in the process of carrying out an operational review of the business.

article The pavilion is the final piece of a renovation project at the former Olympic venue [1948] that began in four years ago as part of the legacy project from the most recent London Games.
Since then, refurbishment of the main 450m track, the addition of a 250m junior track and new floodlights have helped double visitor numbers.
The Herne Hill track was where Sir Bradley Wiggins began his racing career, aged 12.
Hillary Peachey, chairman of the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust (HHVT), said: "It has been a long journey, but I am immensely proud of how the community came together, matched by the generosity of our funders, the project team and the local residents."
Alongside substantial contributions from the London Marathon Charitable Trust, Southwark Council and City Hall, Sport England provided ¬£750,000 of Lottery funds towards construction, while a recent crowdfunding initiative organised by the Friends of the HHV raised ¬£89,000 to fit out the pavilion.
The opening of the facility was attended by Brian Cookson, president of world cycling's governing body the UCI, plus dignitaries including former sport and Olympics minister Baroness Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich and West Norwood Helen Hayes, and London's Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross,
The velodrome hosts a range of activities for different ages and abilities, including dedicated sessions for young children, women, veterans (40+) and free drop-in sessions for the disabled through charity Wheels for Wellbeing. Visit the HHV website for details of times and pricing.

"We handled the occasion really well on Saturday but we couldn't put one front in foot of the other on Tuesday," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"It was a really difficult evening but we've got through."
Bruce has led Hull to Wembley three times in the last four seasons and achieved promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge.
They were relegated to the Championship in 2015 but Bruce has led them steadily up the table, finishing the season in fourth place.
"It could have been our most embarrassing night but it's not, thank the lord," he continued.
"(Tom) Huddlestone clearly wasn't fit. That was a gamble, where he played with a knock, and I shouldn't have took that gamble."
Never in play-off history has a team overturned a three-goal first-leg deficit but Derby came close on Tuesday through Johnny Russell and Andrew Robertson's own goal.
Despite continued pressure from Derby, Hull were able to hold on and secure their spot to face Sheffield Wednesday in an all-Yorkshire final on 28 May.
"I won't try and mask it up any more - we did enough at Derby, where we put in a good performance," Bruce added.
"We know we will perform better than that because we can't be any worse. Let's make sure now that we try our upmost because we have just seen our Achilles heel."

article The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the probe was related to "financial irregularities" at the insurer.
It did not identify individuals or say if they still worked at the business.
RSA Insurance was forced to inject √Ç¬£200m into its Irish unit in 2013.
The company subsequently tapped shareholders for cash through a rights issue to help bolster its finances.
RSA's Irish unit was bailed out weeks after the resignation of its chief executive Philip Smith and after the insurer informed the market about the accounting irregularities.
Mr Smith was initially suspended after an investigation was launched into issues in the Irish unit's claims and finance functions identified during a internal routine audit.
Last month, he won a √¢‚Äö¬¨1.25m compensation payment for a constructive dismissal.
RSA is appealing against the award.
RSA Group's chief executive, Simon Lee, also resigned in the wake of the crisis at the Irish unit. He was eventually replaced by former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester
The FRC said the investigation would cover 2012 "and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group at the end of 2013".
RSA said the FRC's investigation was not into the company itself but into individuals who were members of accounting, auditing or actuarial professional bodies.
It said in a statement: "We understand that the investigation will therefore cover members of these professions who were employed by RSA at the  time. RSA Group will of course assist with these inquiries if requested to do so."
The FRC said it would co-operate with the Irish authorities as necessary.

Fans are set to protest this weekend after a disappointing season that has seen the Gunners' Premier League title challenge fade.
"When we built the stadium the banks demanded that I signed for five years," said the 66-year-old Frenchman.
"Do you want me to say how many clubs I turned down during that period?"
Construction began on the ¬£390m Emirates Stadium in 2004, the year Wenger won the last of his three league titles with the club.
"The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that we have a chance to pay them back," added Wenger, who has been in charge of the north Londoners since 1996.
Arsenal topped the Premier League at the turn of the year but have since slipped to fourth, some 12 points behind leaders Leicester, who can win the title this weekend.
The Gunners were also knocked out of the FA Cup, which they have won for the past two seasons, by Watford in the quarter-finals, and their Champions League campaign again ended in the last 16 for the sixth successive season.
During Saturday's home game against Norwich, fans' groups Black Scarf Movement, RedAction and the Arsenal Supporters Trust want supporters to raise placards reading: "Time for change. Arsenal is stale, fresh approach needed."
However, Wenger said his critics had gone "too far".
He added: "I did commit and I stayed, and under very difficult circumstances.
"So for me to come back and, on top of that, (critics) reproach me for not having won the championship during that period, it is a bit overboard."
Since the end of January, Arsenal have taken only 10 points from a possible 21 in seven home league games.
Wenger said his side lost out on the title "at home against the lower teams", having played some of those games "in a very difficult climate".
He added: "We have to realise that away from home we are championship winners. At home, against the smaller teams, we dropped the points.
"It is very frustrating because we were in a position for a long, long time where we could compete for the title.
"We are disappointed but we have to fight. We have not to forget that in football you go down very quickly and you come up very slowly. We have to stick together.
"I can understand the frustration of our fans but despite that we want to support our team and the best chance you can give to a team is to be behind them."
summary Arsenal fans are planning to stage a protest outside the club's training ground.

article The bill accuses local rights groups of damaging the legitimacy of Israel's military by "branding IDF soldiers and commanders as war criminals".
It was sponsored by the hard-line party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
It follows other recent initiatives from the Israeli right, like requiring an oath of loyalty from non-Jews.
The motion to establish the commission of inquiry will now go to parliament's House Committee for debate, ahead of a full vote before the Knesset.
MK Fania Kirshenbaum - of Mr Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party - who submitted the proposal, accused human rights groups of branding Israeli soldiers as war criminals.
Israeli politics: A lurch to the right?
"These groups provide material to the Goldstone commission [which investigated the 2008-2009 Gaza offensive] and are behind the indictments lodged against Israeli officers and officials around the world," Ms Kirshenbaum said.
A series of arrest warrants for Israeli politicians and military officials have been issued in the last few years, particularly by pro-Palestinian groups in European countries.
The 41-17 vote brought a storm of protest from local rights groups, including Acri, Btselem, Adalah and the Hotline for Migrant Workers.
"Persecution and attempts at silencing will not stop us. In a democracy, criticism of the government is not only legitimate - it is essential," said a statement from Btselem, one of the organisations named in the decision.
The Welfare and Social Services Minister, Isaac Herzog, called it a "political witch hunt" suited to "shady regimes" that would damage Israel's international standing, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Israel "must be a light unto the world in terms of freedom of speech and freedom to express beliefs, and reject proposals that have the scent of McCarthyism," Mr Herzog said, referring to the 1950s communist witch hunt led by US Senator Joseph McCarthy.

article Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement that the men's contracts were not renewed when they ended in April.
However, it also said there were "no grounds to justify criminal proceedings" in the case.
The sports ministry had claimed last week that women players were forced to perform sexual favours to keep their places in the team.
Sri Lanka Cricket has not addressed this claim directly, referring instead to "the unsatisfactory situation that prevailed in the selection... and widely prevalent perceptions of favouritism and bias".
The body said that two of the officials concerned had committed "a few incidents of sexual harassment" but that "there was no evidence of any physical intimacy".
A third man had committed "incidents of improper conduct... which did not amount to sexual harassment".

Yu Tamura's conversion of Amanaki Lotoahea's 76th-minute try almost earned Japan an historic draw in a thrilling international in Cardiff.
Wales had led by 11 points in the second half after tries by Dan Lydiate, Jamie Roberts and Sam Warburton.
Wings Akihito Yamada and Kenki Fukuoka were Japan's other try-scorers.
Leigh Halfpenny scored 15 points with the boot and Japan number eight Amanaki Mafi was named man-of-the-match after a tireless and powerful display.
But it is the 23-year-old Ospreys number 10 Davies who will dominate the headlines after keeping his cool to nail his drop-goal left-footed from 30 metres in only his second international.
It was a rare moment of clarity in a Welsh performance punctuated by errors and a lack of tactical control.
Japan, with fly-half Tamura kicking superbly and Mafi simply magnificent, were worth a draw and were visibly disappointed at the final whistle.
The visitors' refusal to buckle in the face of superior Welsh possession was aided by Wales' unhappy knack of offering up points after scoring themselves.
Twice in the second half Rob Howley's team made a hash of restarts to let Japan back into the game and when Lotoahea juggled Mafi's pass to score his team's third try, it looked as though that would cost Wales dear.
Japan might even have won the game after robbing Wales of possession in the final minutes to break clear, but paid the price when they were turned over and the Welsh drove back downfield.
Howley will be looking for more control against South Africa next week.

Wales made a shambolic start and were trailing by six points and down to 14 men inside eight minutes with Liam Williams in the sin-bin.
A period of relative calm mid-half saw the home team establish forward control and Lydiate's first international try and Roberts' charge from five metres appeared to have restored order.
But far from turning the screw up front, Wales played fast and loose and were punished before the interval when Yamada pounced on Gareth Anscombe's speculative pass and raced 60 yards to score between the posts.
It was the same story after the break, with Warburton's try after great work by Alun Wyn Jones appearing to put Wales in control.
But Japan served up the try of the match through Fukuoka and then a thrilling finish after their third score.
Happily for Wales, Davies kept his head when those around him were losing theirs.

"It is a win but a real poor performance."

A director's home address was revealed on the public register following a "mix-up" of documents being scanned.
Case correspondence was also mistakenly scanned onto the register.
A new personnel system also allowed staff access to information on the duration of colleagues' sickness absences.
Companies House, which currently employs 904 people in Cardiff and registers the information companies are legally required to supply, said it had "an incident process in place that all staff adhere to" when a breach of data protection law happens.

article Francois Hollande said it would not be finalised before Barack Obama left office later this year.
Meanwhile, Germany's economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said it had no chance of being agreed before the US presidential election in November.
The Americans were unwilling to compromise with Europe, he said.
Mr Gabriel, who said over the weekend that the talks had in effect failed, also questioned whether the deal had any chance after the election.
"But if the Americans don't move towards the Europeans, then Europe can't agree to a 'TTIP light'. And with this, the project - at least how it was all planned for this year - has failed," he said.
The US and the European Union have been negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, also known as TTIP, for three years. Both sides had aimed to agree a deal this year.
TTIP aims to reduce or remove a wide range of barriers to transatlantic trade and investment, but has proved controversial in both Europe and America.
A spokesman for the US trade chief told German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday that talks on TTIP were progressing.
President Hollande said in a speech to French diplomats that France wanted to "see things as they are".
"These discussions cannot result in an agreement by the end of the year. The negotiations have bogged down, the positions have not been respected, the imbalance is obvious," he added.
The French leader's comments followed a call by trade minister Matthias Fekl to end negotiations, which he said no longer had political support in France because US negotiators "give nothing or just crumbs".
He wanted a "clear, clean, definitive stop" to the talks, which could resume if wider EU-US trade relations improved.
Mr Fekl said France would ask the European Commission to suspend the talks when trade ministers meet in Slovakia next month.
Italy's trade minister said that a TTIP deal would be reached, but the talks would take longer than expected.
Carlo Calenda said that "TTIP will be sealed - it is inevitable", adding that it was essential for Italian exporters.
The minister admitted it would be difficult to reach a deal before Mr Obama left office, but added: "We have to carry on. This accord is essential for Italy."

article The British star famous for playing Nelson Mandela and starring in The Wire, is reportedly being considered for the next 007.
The Daily Beast is reporting there was leaked email from Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion pictures group.
It is reported the contents said: "Idris should be the next Bond.
Pascal was thought to be emailing Elizabeth Cantillon, the former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures - which distributes the Bond franchise.
There is no confirmation from Idris Elba or from Sony Pictures that the actor will take over to be the next 007.
The 42-year-old has previously said he would play Bond.
During a Reddit AMA in September he responded to a fan's question of whether he'd be willing to take the role, writing: "Yes, if it was offered to me, absolutely."
Daniel Craig, who is currently filming his fourth appearance as Bond in new release Spectre, is signed on to do one more film.
"I've been trying to get out of this from the very moment I got into it. But they won't let me go, and I've agreed to do a couple more," he told Rolling Stone two years ago.
Spectre is due for release in November next year.

article Tim Hughes said he listed the Series One classic on eBay to spark a discussion about its history.
The once iconic 4X4 does not have its original engine and is covered in rust.
Land Rover Historian Roger Crathorne said: "It's ruined. It's more likely to fetch ¬£2,000 than ¬£200,000."
He said the car's chassis number and paperwork confirmed it was the first diesel to be made - but without its original engine it was not in its complete form.
"It's interesting that it's the first diesel off the production line and it's got its original factory registration. But it's not got its original engine and in the state it's in, the price is way out," he added.
Mr Hughes, managing director of Motiv Trailers in Craven Arms, south Shropshire, said he listed the rickety off-roader at ¬£200,000 to generate interest in its past.
"What is it worth? I don't know. But its value is in its history," he said.
Dave Scott, secretary of Warwickshire and West Midlands Land Rover Club, said: "The seller believes this to be the first production 88inch 2 litre diesel. The chassis number certainly supports this."
But he questioned when the car was registered.
"According to Heynes purchase and restoration manual, the diesel was not introduced until June 1957.
"At this time Land Rover could virtually sell everything it produced so creating a five-month stockpile seems odd," said Mr Scott.
Mr Hughes said he had received inquiries from collectors as far afield as Portugal and Germany.
He said: "For every email I've had from someone interested in it there have been four from people saying 'you're off your rocker, you're never going to get that for it.'
"But I've looked at what other historic vehicles like this have gone for over the past 18 months and left the price open. If it exceeds ¬£200,000 then I would be extremely surprised.
"But if someone came forward who wanted to restore it for a price I thought was fair I would sell it."
The up-for-grabs vehicle's design is the basis for the iconic model which became known as the Defender in the 90s.
The last Defender was made at the Solihull factory on 29 January after Jaguar Land Rover discontinued it.
The car's logbook shows it was registered in 1957 and sold 10 years later to Albert George Dyer in Handsworth, Birmingham.
The same owner moved to Adleymoor, Bucknell, Shropshire, in 1975.
Mr Hughes said the robust off-roader was used on a farm until 1982 but had been out of work ever since. He bought the car as a restoration project but does not have the time to dedicate to it.
"I've had people calling up and telling me bits of information about it which has been really useful.
"I'd love someone to come forward and say 'I know that car, it belonged to my dad, here's a picture of it on the beach."

article Jared Kushner said all of his "actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events" of the campaign.
Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia.
He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy.
He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been "fully transparent in providing all the requested information".
"Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts," he said.
Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.
In a statement to both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were "hardly any" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were "perhaps four".
He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton.
Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was "time not well-spent".
Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided.
In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.
He says the first form, a "rough draft that still had many omissions", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months "in the normal course".
Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed.
Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is "happy" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal.
He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign.
Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals.
He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent.
The incomplete security form was the result of a "miscommunication" with an assistant who submitted it too soon.
Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk.
President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.
He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: "As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!"
Russia has also denied any involvement.

article The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working "at the hardest job in the world".
After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea.
Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll.
Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: "The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform.
"They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers."
Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying "look at my money" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth.
And the men wore open-necked shirts as "however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland," he added
Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when "thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever".
At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was "the largest fishing port in the world".
The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because "everything was in the melting pot".
"Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, " he added.
The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars.
Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own.
The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore.
The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland.
This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull.
Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit.
The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed.
Mr Ludlam said the ports had "always been at daggers drawn" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride.
He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed.
The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered.
Mr Ludlam said: "Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back."
The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby

article Mr Buhari, who was elected in March partly on a promise to tackle corruption and insecurity, vowed to select competent and clean individuals.
But when the much-anticipated list was released, many were disappointed, asking whether the wait had been worth it, and whether those selected were the best in the country.
Some say the list is full of old and recycled politicians who have been part of Nigeria's problems.
The youths who worked tirelessly during his campaign have also been disappointed because the average age in the cabinet is 52. Some women's groups have also voiced their anger that there are just six females on the list.
The 36 names approved by MPs - but yet to be given portfolios - include five former governors, nine lawyers, four former senators, three academics, two medical doctors, two retired soldiers and a clergyman.
The combination of experienced politicians and technocrats shows that the president was trying to balance his choice - rewarding party loyalists, while also selecting some professionals.
His hands were also tied by the constitutional requirement to choose at least one person from each of Nigeria's 36 states.
His supporters say the list shows he is committed to fulfilling his election promises, adding that age and gender do not matter at this stage because the country needs to be rescued urgently.
Here are seven interesting characters to watch in the cabinet:
It is not surprising that Mr Fashola made the list.
His achievements during his tenure as governor of Lagos state - Nigeria's commercial capital - makes him a good asset.
He is credited with bringing an element of order to the chaotic city through massive infrastructure development that included demolishing illegal structures to pave the way for new road projects.
Nigeria in pictures: Lagos facelift
As a senior lawyer and experienced administrator, it won't be surprising if he is asked to head the justice ministry.
The president has promised to root out corruption and bribery allegations that tainted the image of Nigeria's judicial system.
The former ExxonMobil executive vice-chairman was appointed by President Buhari in August to head the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), an organisation vital to Africa's largest economy but notorious for corruption and mismanagement.
Many analysts believe his appointment has started to yield results.
It is surprising that he has now been asked to join the cabinet and is very likely to be appointed a minister in the oil ministry.
This means a new NNPC head may have to be appointed.
Even though the president has said he will oversee the ministry himself, most of the work and reforms he plans to carry out will be handled by Mr Kachikwu.
It will be interesting to see how he will help Mr Buhari clean up the oil sector and recover the mind-boggling sums he said had been stolen.
Does Nigeria run better without a cabinet?
Buhari's to-do list
Is Buhari a changed man?
She is a well-known technocrat within and outside Nigeria. She has more than 30 years of experience in the field of development, including as Nigeria's presidential adviser on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
She was credited with designing and developing several government projects aimed at reducing poverty.
Before joining the cabinet, Ms Mohammed was the Special Adviser to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on post-2015 development planning.
Her eloquence and globally-exposed experience in development and management could be an asset to the government if correctly exploited.
He is the most controversial of all the appointees even though his inclusion did not come as surprise.
As President Buhari's campaign director, many Nigerians see Mr Amaechi's appointment as pay-back for the role he played in the president's victory during the election.
However, his choice has been heavily criticised after he was indicted by Rivers state's panel of inquiry for allegedly enriching himself during his eight-year tenure as the state's governor.
He denied all the allegations and said they were politically motivated. He also took the commission to court.
Opposition MPs tried to block his appointment but the ruling party used its majority to get him through.
As Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff between 2008 and 2010, he led a successful campaign against militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
After he was sacked, the militants regrouped in 2011. Since then, thousands of people have been killed and the insurgency has spread to neighbouring countries.
Tackling the group is one of Mr Buhari's top priorities, so it will be interesting to see how Mr Dambazzau will tackle the conflict now, assuming he is asked to head the ministry of defence as expected.
She is an economist and financial expert who was educated and worked in the UK before going back to Nigeria to serve as a commissioner of finance in the south-western state of Ogun.
Many expect her to be posted to the finance ministry.
During her presentation to the Senate, she said funds allocated for various projects are being diverted and identified ways to stop this happening.
She also said the country cannot afford to continue spending 78% of its budget on paying civil servants' salaries and other ongoing costs.
It will be interesting to see how the financial markets, investors and ordinary Nigerians will react to her appointment and whether she will be able to transform the country's struggling economy.
As a veteran politician with four decades of experience, Mr Ogbe, 68, is known to be independent-minded and self-willed and has served in several previous governments.
Many remember him for his public row with ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005, when he was chairman of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party.
He was forced to resign from the position after accusing Mr Obasanjo of interfering in party affairs.
Mr Ogbe is an experienced farmer who is expected to be appointed to lead the vital agriculture ministry.
Nigeria has a vast tracts of land that analysts say, if used properly, could create jobs for the country's army of unemployed youths and reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil.
Nigerians will be hoping that he is able to bring this theory to reality.

article Written off by his rivals and the media after suffering a drubbing at the hands of Narendra Modi's resurgent BJP in last May's general elections, India's most famous anti-corruption campaigner has bounced back.
The former tax inspector took on a ruling party at the peak of its power and felled it in the national capital. For sheer symbolism, Mr Kejriwal's victory in Delhi is astounding, the proverbial David slaying the all-mighty Goliath. The scale of the BJP's defeat makes Mr Kejriwal's win truly extraordinary.
How did India's most powerful and richest party - with its charismatic leader, fabled organisational skills and political nous - get it so wrong?
A little over a year ago, the BJP picked up 32 of 70 seats in hung elections to the Delhi state assembly. Last May, it took all seven of the capital's parliamentary seats, as well as bordering the capital. It rolled out the heavy artillery against Mr Kejriwal in Delhi - Mr Modi himself led the campaign, helped by nearly two dozen federal ministers and 120 MPs. But to no avail. "This is not just a defeat for the BJP, this is a decimation in a high-profile election," says Swapan Dasgupta, a columnist who is no admirer of Mr Kejriwal.
For one, Mr Kejriwal launched his campaign to regain Delhi as early as last July. Most believe the anti-corruption campaigner's masterstroke was telling people that he was sorry for quitting in haste after a chaotic 49-day stint in power following an impressive debut in the December 2013 state polls. He went to every neighbourhood and slum to beg forgiveness. "We have made a mistake", he told people, "but we haven't sinned." In a country where politicians are increasingly seen as aloof and arrogant, Mr Kejriwal's atonement worked wonders. Every comeback needs true believers, and Delhi's voters believed him.
Mr Kejriwal also drove a positive - and populist - campaign focusing on Delhi. The BJP surprised many by running a personal campaign against Mr Kejriwal. It was, most said, bound to backfire.
The fact that Mr Kejriwal's party won more than half of the popular vote - the highest by any party in Delhi ever - also points to the fact that his supporters transcended class and religion:  the poor and the minorities appear to have backed him, and a large section of the middle class, which had deserted him, returned. One young professional, who voted for the BJP in May, told me he was voting for Mr Kejriwal this time because he was unnerved by Mr Modi's failure to gag his party's radical fringe.
But more importantly, say analysts like Neerja Chowdhury, "voters in Delhi also reacted to the BJP's arrogance of power". The BJP is a cadre-based party with deep roots in Delhi. Analysts say voters did not take kindly to former policewoman Kiran Bedi being introduced at the last-minute as the BJP's chief ministerial candidate.  Also, Mr Kejriwal represents what many say is a refreshing brand of unostentatious politics, far removed from the flashy political culture associated with both the BJP and Congress. "Hope has returned," said AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.
It won't be easy. Mr Kejriwal faces considerable challenges in governing one of the world's megacities. Although petty corruption was kept in check, his shambolic 49-day government did not inspire much confidence. Delhi is a complex city-state where 40% of the people are migrants and faces serious problems with water, electricity, housing, air pollution and choking traffic. Can Mr Kejriwal shed his activist mode and make the kind of compromises that come with governance? Analyst Ashish Nandy says the AAP's win is a "return to politics of populism". But just how much populism can Delhi - and India - afford?
For Mr Modi and the BJP, defeat marks the end of the honeymoon period and they are stripped of their aura of invincibility.
Now, fractious - and largely discredited - opposition parties across the country will be emboldened and begin believing they can take on the BJP. That will be easier said than done. Congress, which has drawn a complete blank for the first time in Delhi, appears to be facing an existential crisis. "This is a big morale booster for India's opposition parties," says Neerja Chowdhury. But it will take a lot more effort to translate that spirit into votes against the BJP across the country.
summary Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has resigned from his post as the country's chief minister,

article But Labour and backbench Tory MPs accused ministers of breaking a promise for a vote on the warrant itself.
The debate ended early when Labour lost its attempt to use a rare Parliamentary procedure to postpone the decision.
Earlier, Commons Speaker John Bercow said people would be "contemptuous" of the government's tactics.
BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said there were "scenes of chaos" in the Commons chamber.
The government opted out of all 133 EU police and criminal justice measures measures in 2013, a decision that will take effect on 1 December.
However, ministers plan to rejoin 35 of the measures, including the European Arrest Warrant, before that deadline.
Supporters, including the government and law enforcement agencies, say the warrant is a vital tool to protect the UK and bring criminals to justice across EU borders.
However, critics - including some Conservative MPs - say the European Arrest Warrant is overused and a threat to the liberties of Britons and the sovereignty of the UK.
Commons clashes erupted after Mr Bercow ruled the debate and vote would not cover the arrest warrant.
Mrs May said only 11 of the EU justice measures needed to be voted on and "transposed" into UK law. But she told MPs the Commons' verdict on these measures would be treated as a vote on the whole package of 35.
The debate came to an end when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper invoked a rare procedure to ask that the "question be not now put", asking Mrs May to come back with a motion which specifically included the warrant.
Faced with a potential backbench rebellion, Prime Minister David Cameron returned early from the Lord Mayor's Banquet dressed in a white tie, while other Tories were urgently called back to Parliament to take part in the vote.
When Mrs Cooper's motion was defeated by 272 to 229 - a majority of just 43 - the vote on the EU justice measures took place immediately, with MPs voting in favour by 464 to 38.
The government's approach was criticised by Mr Bercow and Conservative MPs.
"There is not today to be a vote on the specific matter of membership of the European Arrest Warrant," Mr Bercow told MPs.
The Speaker said he himself had expected a vote on the warrant, saying it was a "sorry saga" and that "the House should not be put in that position".
"A commitment is a commitment to be honoured," he said, "rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice".
He said the public expected "straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous, and I use the word advisedly, of what is not straightforward dealing".
Q&A: European Arrest Warrant
Conservative MP Sir Richard Shepherd said the government's behaviour had been "sly", while fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg called it "underhand".
Tory MP Bill Cash, who chairs the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, said: "This is a disgraceful way of going about a very, very important matter. It is tainted with chicanery, it is not the way this Parliament should be treated."
Despite the speaker's ruling, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons the vote would be on all 35 of the EU crime and justice measures.
And Mrs May said the government was not legally required to bring the measures to the House. Transposing some into UK law would usually be done through a special committee of MPs, she said.
When the main debate got under way, Mrs May said she understood concerns over the warrant but said she had legislated to make it "better and safer".
Setting out the case to retain it, she told MPs more than 95% of people extradited from the UK were foreign nationals, including suspects wanted for 124 murders, more than 100 rapes, nearly 500 serious assaults and seven terrorism cases.
The home secretary said "harmful individuals" could walk free and escape justice without the "vital" regulations, saying the process had to be completed by 1 December to avoid an "operational gap".
But Mrs Cooper, who said she supported the European Arrest Warrant, nonetheless said Mrs May had presided over a Parliamentary "shambles".
"You have effectively said ministers are just going to make it up because the Speaker has been very clear that this does not include a vote on the European Arrest Warrant, you are just going to reinterpret it in any way you choose," she said.

article Consider the roadblocks. Bobby Lennox - so shy as a kid he was embarrassed to play football in other people's company.
John Clark - his young life ruined by the death of his father in a railway accident.
Stevie Chalmers - so sick from tuberculosis-meningitis in his late teens and early 20s that he was given three weeks to live.
Jock Stein - left his job as Celtic reserve team manager on account of his religion, the Parkhead board telling him that as a Protestant he had gone as far as he could possibly go at the club.
Stein was in tears that day. So say a number of his former players in a documentary - Glasgow 1967 - about the Lions and the city they came from, to be aired on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST.

It's part football film, part social history, part dream come true, a Cinderella tale to match any Cinderella tale the global game has ever produced. So much has been said and written about them. A quick online search shows that at least 32 books, two plays and a novel have been penned in their honour.
In this past week, the newspapers have been full of supplements, fine journalism that came at the story from new angles. There are other documentaries available, there are CDs, there's a Lisbon Lions cushion, if you fancy it, there's a Lions tea towel, a Lions iPad cover, a Lions mouse mat.
On Sunday at Celtic Park, 60,000 people created a stunning visual display that evoked their legend. On Thursday, thousands more will gather at the SSE Hydro to do it all again, this time in the company of Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Alex Ferguson, Martin O'Neill, Gordon Strachan and others.
The story never gets old, the appetite never sated.
There's a simple and lovely moment close to the beginning of Glasgow 1967 when Willie Wallace, now living in Australia, revisits Celtic Park and wanders about its corridors. "Fifty years and they're still going on about it," he says with a smile on his face that spoke of pride, no doubt, but also amusement at all the fuss.
These lads didn't do fuss. They didn't consider themselves celebrities, just footballers, guys who adored the game and who were blessed with a talent and a hunger to succeed.
On that May day, Jimmy Johnstone, hot to trot, stared over at the bronzed athletes of Inter Milan as they took to the field in Lisbon and said to Bertie Auld: "Look at them, wee man, they're like film stars!"
And Auld's answer cut to the heart of the greatness that was about to show itself. "Aye, but can they PLAY?"
The Lions could play on a carpet and they could play on a ploughed field just as fluently. There's footage of them training on muck, not grass. That was the way of it. That was the norm. There's more footage of what tough economic times they lived in and yet amid the gloom this thing of beauty emerged.

The documentary is called Glasgow 1967 for a reason, for what shines through is the character not just of the players and their manager, but of their supporters and their city.
Humour courses through the narrative of Lisbon like a fast-running river. The emotion and the hilarity of the supporters elevates what happened to almost mythical proportions.
The fans are here in numbers. Ian Martin making a cup of tea in his kitchen and telling of the day he left for Lisbon in a Mini Cooper as part of a three-car cavalcade. "One of the boys in the other motor lost his suitcase even before he got to Bishopbriggs. It fell off the roof-rack."
There's Jimmy Quinn telling of an uncomfortable conversation with his fiancee. "I said, 'See this getting married carry-on, saving up for an engagement ring an' that, I want to go to the cup final. End of story'. She wasn't a bit pleased."
John Cowan was on a flight out of Glasgow that touched down uncomfortably close to kick-off-time. The doors of the plane swung open. The airline had no steps in place and the 19-year-old John didn't have the luxury of waiting - so he jumped.
"I sat down on the ledge and went for it," he recalls. "There was guys coming behind me. Dropping, dropping, dropping. And we started running towards the terminal."

God knows where Charlie Fryars and his mates were at this point, but Fryars' personal odyssey is a glorious illustration of the fact that, in many ways, there were more than 11 Lions in Lisbon.
Charlie tells part of his tale in the documentary, the full comic brilliance of it being told in a piece he has written for the ByTheMinute Celtic platform online. It begins when his mate, Gerry Loney, rings him up and offers him a seat in his Austin Cambridge, bound for Lisbon.
Charlie and Gerry plus Laurence Donnelly, John Hughes and Jim McDaid met at the Admiral Bar in Waterloo Street in Glasgow and hit the road. They had almost 2,000 miles to drive and three days to do it. That meant no hotel stops and as few comfort breaks as possible. Their first destination was Southampton to catch the boat to Cherbourg. They got as far as Lockerbie when the car broke down.
The explorers made the ferry, got some sleep on the four-hour crossing, drove down the Cotentin Peninsula and into Nantes where they had some beers in a bar near the station - and another kip. Not Charlie, though. Charlie was busy falling in love with a 19-year-old waitress called Ghislaine.
After half an hour, Ghislaine threw her arms around him and gave him a kiss. "She wanted my Celtic scarf and I said to her, 'No, we need it for hanging out the window." What greater love can one man have for his football club than to refuse to lay down his scarf for the gorgeous Ghislaine?
On they went - a thousand miles to go and only 33 hours left. Their exhaust pipe went near La Rochelle, but they got help and found a new one. They had a moment of weakness near San Sebastian, but they pulled back from the brink and carried on.
They came to the Portuguese border and it was closed for the night. The guards saw their colours and waved them through.
They made the kick-off, celebrated thunderously and then turned around and drove home. They were seven days on the road there and back, a whole week sleeping in the Austin Cambridge; unwashed, weary, but with memories that will sustain them for the rest of their lives. They didn't play that day in Lisbon, but what is that if not footballing heroism?
"When I got home," says Charlie, "I got my Celtic scarf and I parcelled it up and I wrote a letter to Ghislaine at Bar de la Garde, Nantes... I never heard from her." On that 4,000 mile trek, two happy endings was too much to hope for.
One was enough, more than enough. In this film, you marvel anew not just at what the Lions achieved, not just the lengths that 10,000 Celtic people went to in order to see them achieve it, but how powerful that achievement remains to this day, the magnitude of it passed on from father to son through the generations.
Glasgow 1967: The Lisbon Lions will be shown on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 on Wednesday 24 May. It can be seen in other parts of the United Kingdom at 23:20.

article The Number Four Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Henan province was partially demolished on Thursday amid a land dispute, Xinhua news agency said.
Hospital staff told reporters equipment worth over $600,000 was damaged.
The case has sparked outrage in China, where forced demolitions are common.
Doctors told local media that several men in camouflage uniforms showed up at the hospital, in Huiji district, on Thursday, and began bulldozing the building.
Liu Chunguang, director of the hospital's radiology department, told Xinhua news agency he was examining a patient when the demolition took place.
"A gaping hole appeared - the patient was half-scared to death, and ran out."
Meanwhile, hospital official Yuan Fang told Xinhua that radiology equipment had been damaged and the hospital had had to suspend its activities, forcing many patients to switch hospitals.
"Burying the bodies of patients in rubble is extremely disrespectful to the deceased," he added.
The local Huiji district government said in a statement that the hospital's CT room and morgue were on land designated for a road expansion project, and that it had asked the hospital to dismantle the rooms themselves several times.
The hospital was evacuated prior to demolition, and there were no casualties, the statement added.
However, hospital officials said three doctors and a patient were in the building at the time of demolition, and that some hospital workers were injured when they tried to stop the demolition, Jinghua news reported.

article In Scotland, 351.4mm of rainfall was recorded with Cluanie Inn, Ross and Cromarty, the wettest place (768.4mm)
It was also an unusually warm month, with temperatures about 2.7C above the long term average.
Provisional figures also reveal 2015 was the second wettest year on record in Scotland. Only 2011 was wetter.
Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: "It fits in with most people's perceptions that in the latter part of the year it was particularly wet.
"There were a a lot of fronts approaching the UK from the Azores and the Tropics. Warmer air brings moisture and that translates into more rainfall."
The average temperature (including both day and night) was 5.4C, making it the fifth warmest on record. The long term average (1910-1981) for Scotland in December is 2.8C.
Annual rainfall for 2015 was 1869.2mm, only beaten by the 1886.4mm recorded in 2011.
By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst
The Met Office says there is a direct link between the warmth and the record rains that brought widespread floods across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England.
Storms propelled by the jet stream were mainly to blame, it says, with contributions from the El Nino weather phenomenon and man-made climate change.
December was something of a freak month, it acknowledges. Climate change has raised UK temperatures by around 1C (1.8F) so far, so it will be many decades before this level of extreme weather becomes the new winter norm, it says.
Other scientists say that with climate change, there will be no "normal" weather.

Scotland was one of the few countries in the UK to experience regular frosts. The UK as a whole saw just 2.6 days of air frost which is eight days below the long term average.
Mr Madge said it was too early to deduce long term trends but he added: "When you look at the wettest years, five out of six for the UK as a whole have been since 2000."

article Praveen Sood told the BBC that police officers had reviewed footage from almost 70 CCTV cameras.
But he said police were looking into isolated incidents in other parts of the city that night.
A number of women have told the media they were assaulted by groups of men.
Some have described being surrounded by unruly mobs, and being groped and harassed.
Praveen Sood said police had responded to footage from a member of the public who said a woman had been attacked by two men on a motorbike near his home.
"We had a look at it. We saw it was quite a clear case of serious molestation. We didn't wait, we didn't even bother with whom the victim is. We didn't ask her, we wanted to protect her identity. We have registered a criminal case," he said.
But, Mr Sood said, the alleged attacks in the centre of Bangalore never took place. The incidents are said to have occurred in the MG road area as a crowd of 10,000 people gathered there to see in the New Year on Saturday.
He said the footage being used by the media to make allegations of mass molestation was actually that of the melee that had resulted from a baton charge by police who were trying to disperse the crowds.
"People ran, there were a lot of girls there. There was panic, there was a melee, they got separated, they were crying√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ so that 30 seconds of confusion is being projected as a mass molestation. I categorically say that nothing of that sort has happened," he said.
Six people held on Wednesday were detained over an incident in a different part of the city, he said.
Mr Sood said that despite a public appeal, no one had come forward to record a complaint of molestation or harassment.
He said, however, that he had seen some women telling the media that they were touched inappropriately and that the police were ready to treat those statements as complaints and begin an investigation.
One woman, a marketing professional who asked to be identified only as Pooja, told the BBC that she was assaulted both in a bar and as she walked to meet a friend.
Even when she formed a circle with another group of girls to try and walk to safety, "there were guys who were trying to touch here and there", she said.
"There was not a single face you could make out or who was doing it," she said, pointing out how difficult it would be to file a complaint.
Another woman, photographer Chaitali Wasnik, told the BBC she was groped in another part of Bangalore on New Year's Eve.
She said a man approached her and tried to grab her breasts, but ran away when she fought back.
"I want the girls to know that you can come forward and speak it out, whatever you have faced," she told the BBC. "You don't have to be scared."

article The Brazilian town of Tabatinga vies for size and importance with Colombia's Leticia. While on the Peruvian side - across the mighty Amazon River - is the tiny hamlet of Santa Rosa. Together they form a unique 'triple town' known as Tres Fronteiras.
Though far from the glamour cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - the engines of Brazil's economic miracle - Tabatinga is experiencing a period of extraordinary growth. This is a city with three universities, a deep-water port, and an international airport - all built within the last five years to serve a population that has doubled in size since 2000.

Tabatinga is now more than a match for its neighbour Leticia, though the capital of Colombia's Amazonas state has also changed beyond recognition in recent years.
Three decades ago, this was a key staging post in Pablo Escobar's narco-trafficking network. The man who engineered this network for Escobar - Evaristo Porras - built his personal mansion here, painstakingly reproducing the Carrington Family home from the TV series Dynasty.
The mansion is now a ruin, though others have been turned into boutique hotels. Tourism is booming in Leticia, and helping to fill the void left by the collapse of the cartels with honest dollars.
The Peruvian side of the trio is very much the junior partner. With a population of only around 600, Santa Rosa is not much more than a single street. There's a handful of cevicherias, or fish restaurants, where tourists staying in Tabatinga or Leticia come to sample Peru's famous cuisine.
But no running water, electricity or other basic services. This may soon change as the Brazilian economic miracle sucks in more and more cheap imports from Peru.
Among these imports is illegal timber. Deforestation rates on the Brazilian side of the border have fallen dramatically in recent years, according to government figures. But rates in Peru have increased - leading some to accuse Brazil of merely outsourcing the problem to its neighbours.
Meanwhile the cocaine trade hasn't gone away, and there are rumours of a new strain of the drug - allegedly genetically modified - that's able to grow in lowland areas like the Amazon basin as well as in its native highland environment.
Together with illegal distilleries, drug smuggling and deforestation threaten the survival of indigenous communities living in the forest surrounding our square mile. With hardwoods fetching up to $3,000 (√Ç¬£1,850)  (per tree, and a kilo of cocaine worth about the same, the temptations are immense.
To protect themselves and their forest, the Huitoto people have taken policing into their own hands with the formation of the Indigenous Guard. Armed with sticks, they patrol the forest and report any wrongdoing to the police.
But the nature of the territory does not make things easy for them - with its thousands of small rivers and streams, our square mile is a smuggler's paradise, and Tabatinga is still thought to be the main point of entry of cocaine into Brazil. Behind the development success story, the old sources of wealth are still going strong.
summary Tabatinga is a small town in the Amazon region of Peru.

article Initial reports spoke of two bombs but it gradually became clear that there was a single blast, possibly in the third carriage of the train.
Dozens of people were wounded, and seven people died in the immediate aftermath. Another victim died on the way to hospital and two more fatalities were confirmed later in hospital. The wounded were taken to four city hospitals.
Although the explosion happened in between the two stations the driver continued to Tekhnologichesky Institut to enable victims to be helped more easily. Russia's investigative committee said this decision may have helped prevent further losses.
Early indications were that the bomb was an improvised device made out of the explosive TNT and was possibly hidden in a briefcase close to the carriage doors. Pictures from the scene showed mangled doors and bodies on the floor of the platform.
Minutes later another device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. That was safely defused and reports said it contained 1kg of TNT, more than used in the original blast.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the blast as a "terrorist act" and Russia's investigative committee said it was opening a criminal inquiry under article 205 of the criminal code which refers specifically to terrorist acts. The committee said that all other possibilities were being investigated too.
No organisation has said it carried out the attack but a local website Fontanka.ru and Ren TV published a photo captured by CCTV cameras of a bearded man wearing a black hat and coat. It is not known if he survived the blast.
At the time of the explosion President Vladimir Putin was just outside Russia's second city, meeting Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at the Konstantin palace in Strelna.
The St Petersburg metro was shut down and three days of mourning declared. Traffic in surrounding streets and in much of central St Petersburg was brought to a standstill for hours, and volunteers offered lifts via social media to people trying to get home.
Moscow authorities said they were taking additional security measures on the Russian capital's metro, and at stations, airports and other public places.
Russia's transport infrastructure has been targeted before.

article The country's first president of indigenous origin faces a tough challenge after 10 years in power.
He called a referendum to ratify constitutional amendments approved by parliament last year.
Mr Morales says he needs a third term for social reforms but the opposition says the change is undemocratic.
"On Sunday we will win big," Mor Morales said during the campaign. "The people will decide and there will be a lot to celebrate."
Mr Morales, an indigenous Aymara and former coca leaf producer, took office in January 2006.
His second term ends in 2020 but he will be able to run for another term in 2019 and serve until 2025 if the referendum is approved.
Mr Morales has already been elected three times but argues that the first term does not count because a new constitution was approved in 2009, re-founding the country as Plurinational State of Bolivia.
Despite a drop in the international price of oil and natural gas, the Bolivian economy has performed well in the past 10 years, growing on average 5% a year.
The government's socialist policies have also been successful in reducing extreme poverty.
But recent allegations that Mr Morales used his influence to favour a Chinese construction firm in Bolivia have damaged his approval ratings.
A former girlfriend of Mr Morales, Gabriela Zapata, holds an important position in the company, CAMC, which has secured more than $500m (√Ç¬£350m) in contracts with the Bolivian government
Mr Morales rejected the allegations and said he had nothing to hide. He ordered an investigation into how the contracts were awarded.

article The Android store will abandon the low/medium/high maturity classifications it has used until now and switch to a system run by an outside body.
As increasing numbers of youngsters are left alone to play with smartphones and tablets, the move will allow Google to show it takes its responsibilities seriously.
But there remains the potential for confusion - and controversy.
Google says it wants to reassure parents that apps are properly labelled by bringing in the experts rather than relying on developers to self-certify their products, as had been the case until now.
Rather than use its own proprietary classifications, it will offer parents and children labels similar to those already used to provide guidance about the suitability of boxed video games for different age groups, which should be relatively familiar.
A relatively new body called the International Age Rating Coalition.
It was founded two years ago, but its members have been in the age classification business for decades.
Instead of a centralised office issuing a single global age rating for each app, Iarc's five participants each give their own grades, taking into account local laws and different cultural sensitivities.
So, apps that contain nudity, violence, references to gambling and drugs and other potentially unsuitable material, will be ranked differently depending on where in the world a user's account is based.
The bodies involved are:
Generic ratings are assigned to territories without a participating authority.
If, for whatever reason, one or more of the rating authorities refuse to classify an app, it will not be distributed in the relevant countries.
Iarc says not.
Developers only have to fill in a single questionnaire about how their apps function and the content they contain.
The different bodies then share the information.
Makers of apps that don't contain content of their own - including calendars, calculators and other utilities - should be able to complete the process in less than a minute, the coalition's chairwoman Patricia Vance told the BBC. Even those involving more work shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes.
The system is automated, so the ratings should be spat out shortly after the answers are punched in.
However, Iarc promises there will be manual checks of the most popular apps and any which receive complaints from customers.
"The volume of apps in a storefront like Google Play is just enormous," explained Pegi's Dirk Bosmans.
"We can't follow the same [hands-on] approach that we do for boxed games, but we don't have to make the process as robust as there's no physical product here.
"If a physical product is mis-rated that's a logistical nightmare as you have to pull the boxes back from the shops and reprint them.
"With apps you can just say, 'That age seven rating should have been a 12,' and with a snap of the finger, reprogramme it."
Actually, Google Play isn't the first to throw its lot in with Iarc.
Mozilla's lesser-used Firefox Marketplace already depends on its rankings.
And the body says Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are also set to join.
Iarc would love to take over the iOS store's age ratings and says it has discussed the possibility with the iPhone-maker.
But for now, Apple has opted to retain its own system.
That could potentially be confusing for families using a mix of devices.
For example, Apple's guidelines state that an app depicting mild occurrences of cartoon-like violence should get a nine+ rating, but the ESRB allows the same type of product to be classed E, meaning suitable for everyone.
Likewise, Apple says apps including nudity should be limited to a 17+ audience, while Pegi says nudity is fine for the 3+ crowd if it's non-sexual and 16+ if erotic.
Apple declined to comment about its future plans.
Not quite.
The ratings are limited to an app's content and don't involve privacy issues.
So, Iarc's members would judge a storybook app, for instance, to be suitable for a pre-teen age group based solely on the innocuous plot it tells.
But it could still be problematic if it required the user to share data about their location, contacts, photos or other device use.
This is a real concern. Earlier this month, 29 privacy watchdogs across the globe announced they were investigating what information was being collected by some of the leading apps targeted at children because of fears that too much personal information was being recorded.
Apps containing user generated content that isn't moderated before publication pose a separate challenge.
The ESRB plans to give such products a "teen" rating, while Pegi will instead show an exclamation mark icon, indicating that further parental guidance is necessary.
Yes. But there are proposals to change this.
Some campaigners are pressing for an age-verification scheme that would let app stores confirm that young device-owners were old enough to download a product without needing to hold personal information about them on file.
This would involve a trusted third party carrying out the necessary ID checks and then vouching for the child's age at the point of purchase, explains Dr Rachel O'Connell, chief executive of the tech advisory service Trust Elevate.
If the child was flagged as being below Iarc's relevant age rating, she said, an email could be automatically sent to their parents asking for their permission.
While it might take years to get such an initiative up and running, the GSMA - which represents mobile operators - says other steps could be taken in the meantime.
It suggests age-restricted apps could pose children a series of challenging questions to try to catch out those attempting to pretend to be older than they are - such as requiring them to type in their date of birth - and only giving them one chance to get the answer right.
There are also existing parental control apps and settings in Android Lollipop that can be used to prevent unauthorised access to the marketplace and only allow children access to specific titles.
summary Android has announced it will not be using a new version of the Android operating system.

article The country is already a pioneer in the use of mobile money.
The government is looking to tap into that network by allowing mobile phone users to trade the government securities across their phones.
Kenyans can buy one of the bonds for as little as 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30; √Ç¬£23), the country's central bank said.
Kenya's banking system is fuelled by mobile payments.
The main provider of mobile transactions, M-Pesa - which is Swahili for money - has about 20 million users, and there are more than 100 times as many M-Pesa kiosks as there are cash machines in Kenya.
Finance Minister Henry Rotich said the government was initially making a limited offer of 150 million shillings to test the new bond before a bigger offer in June.
Kenya has borrowed heavily in the past four years to fund an ambitious construction programme, including roads and a new railway.
The bond, called M-Akiba, can be bought by phone users without any need for a bank account and pays an estimated interest of 10%.
Aly Khan Satchu, a financial analyst in Nairobi, told the BBC: "It's giving access to every Kenyan citizen to government securities.
"The idea of collecting nickel and dimes and aggregating them will be a source of potentially cheap money for the government.
"But I think ultimately it's a story about enfranchisement - allowing people with as little as $30 to invest in the capital markets. That's a good thing."
The country's central bank governor, Patrick Njoroge, said the bond would "dramatically improve the savings culture of our people".
Ronak Gadhia, an analyst at Exotix Partners, said he believed it was the first country to issue such bonds.
"And that is because no other country in the world has adopted mobile banking as much as Kenya has."
Kenya's mobile-traded government bond has been in the works since 2015, and was finally launched today.
For as little as $30, Kenyan mobile users can now lend to the government and get paid a tax-free interest of 10% every six months.
Even though the minimum requirement is very low, government bonds have always been the preserve of the well-to-do, and a high level of awareness will be required for less investment-savvy individuals to take this up.
The success of this bond would shake up financial services by giving small investors alternatives to low interest earning accounts in banks, mobile money wallets, and savings co-operatives.
Apart from encouraging people to save, the platform will provide the Kenyan government with a new source of cheap money that it intends to use to finance large infrastructure projects.
Currently, only 2% of government bonds in Kenya are bought and sold by individual investors.
summary The government is looking to expand the use of mobile money in the United States.

article Last week, UKIP's ruling body excluded one of the better known candidates to succeed Nigel Farage because his application missed by the deadline by 17 minutes.
Three members of the executive promptly resigned, one of them telling the BBC the party was in a fight for its very survival.
"There is a huge amount of confusion, flux and sadly infighting," Steven Woolfe, the excluded candidate, told me, as he pinned the blame on the executive.
Over at the Labour Party, the mood is, if anything, more poisonous.
After its National Executive imposed a retrospective cut-off date for party members to be eligible to vote in next month's election, it was challenged in court and lost.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of each case, from the outside it does not look great for those who ask us for our votes on polling day to appear to be narrowing the choice in their own internal elections.
There are plenty of reasons to wonder whether the political parties are increasingly out-of-step with the voters.
The European referendum is only the latest example.
There is much to be said for maintaining your principles even when they are not popular.
So, the Liberal Democrats say they will campaign at the next general election for the UK to be in the EU.
Two peers are reported to have resigned the party whip in protest, perhaps aware that it might not increase the chances of a Lib Dem revival to set its face against the - albeit narrow - decision of a majority of those who voted.
Last year's general election result has not filled any of the parties with confidence, with perhaps the exception of the SNP.
Labour's recovery from one of its worst ever results - in 2010 - consisted of increasing its share of the vote by 1.5%, and losing seats in the process.
The Liberal Democrat share collapsed from 23% to just under 8%.
Its 57 MPs were reduced to eight.
Those two parties, as well as the Conservatives, were all but eliminated from Westminster's Scottish constituencies.
Even UKIP, which took close to four million votes, finishing third overall, ended up with only one MP.
Divided oppositions do not win elections, but they help to hand power to those that do.
David Cameron has bequeathed to his successor, Theresa May, a majority Conservative government, even though the Tories won just shy of 37% of the vote.
"The Tory party is not as strong as the opinion polls might imply," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Foreign Secretary, said.
But he believes the threat to the party's unity posed by Europe has passed.
Although there are divisions even among supporters of Brexit over what deal the UK should negotiate as it leaves the EU, he doubts they will lead to any kind of split, not least because of the cohesive effect on parties of being in power.
"Why is the Tory Party the world's oldest political party?" he asked rhetorically.
"It has been around for 300 years.
"Of course there have been divisions, but the Tory party basically does not have an ideology.
"It has never had an ideology.
"It occasionally has an existential problem, and it does not have one now."
Jenny Willott, one of those Lib Dem MPs ousted in 2015, thinks both her party and UKIP have one advantage compared with the others, a clear and consistent position on the EU.
She thinks the Conservatives and Labour could be hit by divisions over the Brexit negotiations, and at the next general election that could become a cause more important than party.
"We may see people not just standing on the old ticket, so that we have a Labour candidate, a Lib Dem, Tory, UKIP, whatever; I think we might actually see people defining themselves much more clearly as to where they stand on Europe," she said.
The European Union was one of those issues of consensus in the mainstream of British politics; even sceptics such as Sir Malcolm or Jeremy Corbyn still believed the UK should remain in.
Another was light-touch financial regulation, the failure of which exacerbated the effects of the financial crisis.
Faith in the judgement of political elites follows the decline in the "broad church" appeal of political parties.
If there ever was a correlation between income, class and voting, it looks pretty threadbare now.
It is this combination of factors which has made Frank Field, a Labour MP since 1979, sceptical about his party's chances.
Never known for his respect for consensus in politics, Mr Field believes UKIP is "threatening to kill the Labour Party".
Assuming it can overcome its leadership problems, he fears UKIP could do to Labour south of the Scottish border what the SNP has done north of the border.
"If they reshape themselves as the English Party, then there is a real danger that the million voters who previously voted for us in the last election who moved over to UKIP," he said, could be followed by others, "making it impossible for us to be a serious party of opposition challenging for government."
Mr Field said it was not a case of UKIP "stealing" Labour's vote; this passionate EU-sceptic believes there is not what people used to term a "core vote" to steal.
"There clearly is a very, very large section of the Labour vote that does not actually feel natural affinity with Labour any more," he said.
"They are more concerned about the sense of place, of identity, of country."
As Labour MPs agonise about whether or not to split from the parliamentary party in the event of Jeremy Corbyn winning the leadership election, Frank Field fears they may be missing the point.
"We can have this top-down approach that we had with the Gang of Four, the founding of the SDP," he told me.
"We might well do that, but I do not think anybody's listening.
"The key thing that is happening is that voters are moving."
In what direction and who will be there to meet them when they arrive is a question no party politician can answer; no wonder they are so nervous.
As a leading figure in the French Revolution is said to have remarked: "I am their leader and must follow them."

article The countries joined the EU in 2007 but many member states put limits on their citizens working which end this year.
This has raised concerns in the UK that many will now come to seek jobs.
But BBC surveys in each country, both of more than 1,000 people, suggest most would move only with a firm work offer.
Of those questioned more people intended to seek work in the EU including the UK in 2013 than in 2014.
By Sanchia BergBBC Newsnight
There is a significant gap between aspiration and making real concrete plans.
We found that in Romania very small numbers of people, 1% of the total survey sample, said they were looking for work in the UK in 2013 or 2014, whether with a recruitment agency or on their own.
In Bulgaria the figures were higher: 4.2% of those surveyed. However most people interested in coming to the UK, from both countries, said they would only move with a firm offer of work, either from an agency or directly from a company.
For now, more people are planning to move this year, rather than next, but as 2014 approaches, intentions may change.
That is one reason why it is hard to predict precise numbers from the research - the other is that the sample sizes, especially for concrete preparations, are very small.
The survey was complex. It had a long series of questions, ending up with concrete preparations, to try to filter out aspiration, and only capture those who are making real plans.
Read Sanchia's full analysis
A significant number said they would like to work in the UK, but the number making concrete plans was much smaller.
Romania and Bulgaria are among the poorest countries in Europe and when they joined the European Union in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration.
These measures will be dropped on 1 January 2014 giving Bulgarians and Romanians the same rights to work across the union as other EU citizens.
Some in the UK have voiced fears that ending restrictions will trigger a huge influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants seeking work as happened when in 2004 the UK allowed people from European Union accession states including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work freely.
BBC Newsnight wanted to find out what impact these changes were likely to have, particularly on the numbers intending to come to Britain.
In February 2013 the programme commissioned a test poll, asking independent survey company Vitosha to question 1,000 people across Bulgaria.
People were asked if they intended to come to the UK to work. Over a quarter answered yes.
Analysts say the relatively high figure is unsurprising - times are tough in Bulgaria and many Bulgarians dream of a better life. In some surveys as many as 50% of Bulgarians have said they would like to work abroad, but over the past decade only about 6% have actually left.

BBC Newsnight then asked Vitosha in Bulgaria and Gallup Romania to design a questionnaire which would distinguish between aspiration and real concrete plans.
In March 2013 each of the agencies interviewed face to face more than 1,000 people representative of the country as a whole, in villages, in cities, in all regions of Romania and Bulgaria.

People were asked a range of questions about their current situation and whether they had any intentions to move elsewhere in the EU.
When asked whether in the past five years they had considered moving to live and work in another EU member state, 33% of the 1,101 Romanians polled said yes, 67% said no. Of the 1,014 people questioned in Bulgaria - 37% said yes, 63% said no.
When all of those polled were asked to pick their first choice of EU country to move to in either 2013 or 2014, 4.6% of Romanians and 9.3% of Bulgarians chose the UK. These numbers rose to 8.2% for Romanians and 13.6% for Bulgarians when they were asked directly about whether they would consider the UK as a destination.
In the past people from Romania and Bulgaria who have worked in other EU countries have usually opted for places they can reach by car or where the culture and language are closer to their own.
That was still the case among the 197 Romanians who said they were intending to work in another EU country in 2013 - 30% of them said they wanted to go to Italy, 24% to Germany, and 16% to the UK.
However, the Newsnight survey suggested that the UK is becoming a more attractive destination.
When it came to Romanians intending to work in another EU country in 2014, a much smaller group of 73 people, the percentages changed - 25% wanted to go to Italy, 18% to Germany, and 26% to the UK.
Of the 242 Bulgarians who said they intended to work elsewhere in the EU in 2013 - 30% said they wanted to go to Germany, 27% to the UK and 10% to Spain.
As for Bulgarians intending to work elsewhere in the EU in 2014, again a smaller group, 123 people, 31% wanted to go to Germany, 24% to the UK and 12% to Spain.
Some people said one country for 2013 and a different one for 2014 - so they appear twice.
To get a clearer idea of how many people might actually come to the UK, those who had said they were planning to head to the UK were then asked whether they had made any concrete plans to move.
These plans included searching for somewhere to live and to work.
The number of positive responses fell significantly, though more Bulgarians than Romanians were making concrete plans.
Just 1.2% of the Bulgarians and 0.4% of the Romanians said they had begun to look for accommodation.
The numbers were similarly small for those who had started looking for a job - 2.8% of the Bulgarians had started to look for a job with a recruitment agency and 0.3% of the Romanians.
And 1.4% of the Bulgarians and 0.7% of the Romanians had begun to look for work without the aid of a recruitment agency.
With such small numbers analysts say you cannot safely estimate real numbers of how many will come.
"I think if you're looking at who's making concrete plans, say who's spoken for instance to a recruitment consultancy or who has a firm job offer, I think yes the sample sizes there are a bit small to say specifically who are the numbers who are coming," Peter Flade, director of Gallup UK, told BBC Newsnight.
Many of the people who came to the UK from Poland and other eastern European countries did so without a job awaiting them. However, the results of the Newsnight surveys suggest that, for now at least, most Romanians and Bulgarians would only come to the UK with a firm offer of work.
Looking at Romania, of the 90 people who said they were planning to work in the UK, 65% would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
For the 138 Bulgarians answering this question, 60% said they would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
When looking at what kind of people are interested in moving to the UK, the Bulgarian survey suggested they tend to be younger and they are more likely to be unemployed than the average in the survey.
The Romanian survey suggested people interested in moving to the UK are more likely to have a university degree, more likely to be employed, and are likely to be more affluent than those looking to move elsewhere in the EU.
The surveys were conducted before UK Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech in March suggesting restricting entitlements for new immigrants.
However, Newsnight asked whether the UK government considering restricting state benefits to Romanians and Bulgarians would affect their desire to come to the UK.
Although the 90 Romanian respondents who were interested in working in the UK were more professional and better off than the average respondent in the survey, just under half said it would affect their decision to a great or very great extent.
In Bulgaria, most people interested in working in the UK said a benefits change would not affect their decision.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight Bulgaria's Minister of Economy, Energy and Tourism Assen Vassilev said he did not think there would be a mass exodus of Bulgarians when the changes came into effect.
"I think people who wanted to leave have already left. Gone somewhere, come back, gone somewhere else come back. And going back to the survey that shows that 60-70% of people want a firm job offer. They know that going to a place that looks nice in pictures is not going to make your life better."
NB: When looking at the detailed tables that accompany these polls, it is important to look not just at the percentages, but at the total number of respondents who answer each question. At times this number will comprise the entire sample, a large figure that has been designed to reflect the views of the entire population. However, at other times, the number of people responding to individual questions may be as low as 20 and certainly fewer than 100. The margin of error increases significantly as the number of people answering any question diminishes.

article The Magna Carta, Winston Churchill and "one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known" were all celebrated in his Westminster Hall speech.
The President was determinedly upbeat.
On Iraq, he said "our combat mission has ended". On Afghanistan, he declared: "We have broken the Taliban's momentum".
He added: "We will not relent until the people of Libya are protected, and the shadow of tyranny is lifted."
At the heart of his speech was the case for the US, the UK and their allies to play a leading role in global politics.
Unlike President Roosevelt and Churchill they could not set right the world over a brandy, he said, but these countries remained the "greatest catalysts for global action".
Members of Parliament who shared their excitement with the world on Twitter just waiting for the President to arrive made their appreciation obvious as he reminded them he was the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the British Army.
But even before the standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech was complete, they were picking through Barack Obama's state visit comments seeking support for their own political arguments, or evidence of splits with the prime minister.
Earlier, at their joint press conference, David Cameron said: "The president and I agree that we should be turning up the heat in Libya."
It was almost as if he foresaw reporters using folksy pictures of him and President Obama cooking burgers for veterans in the Downing Street garden to illustrate his point.
The President, though, struck a different tone there.
"I think there may be a false perception that there are a whole bunch of secret, super-effective air assets that are in a warehouse somewhere that could just be pulled out and that would immediately solve the situation in Libya," he said.
"That's not the case."
There would be a slow, steady process, he said, and patience was necessary.
Even as the state visit began the US press corps were reminded by the White House that President Obama had told the UK that the US commitment in Libya would be "limited in scope and duration".
The director of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Professor Michael Clarke, said the strikes by US unmanned Predator drones taking place in Libya were the sort of intervention the military coalition opposing Colonel Gaddafi most wanted.
But there were those in the Conservative Party who hoped for more from the President than comments about patience, slow progress and limitations.
One senior Tory backbencher said: "How can he say all that and not help more in Libya?"
The Conservative vice chairman of the party's backbench foreign affairs and defence committee, Mark Pritchard, said: "The United States military is doing much; but the reluctance of President Obama, for primarily domestic political reasons, not to fully commit the United States to the conflict in Libya could unhelpfully prolong the conflict."
Rival British politicians were also listening carefully to the President's words on the economy.
David Cameron sought common ground when he said debt ratios on both sides of the Atlantic would be falling by the second half of this decade - a target set for the UK by the Chancellor.
The President acknowledged the "sequencing or pace" of the two countries' efforts to deal with their deficits could turn out to be different, but said that was down to differences in their economies and the pressures they faced.
He also said both governments wanted to achieve the same ends without mortgaging their futures and leaving a mountain of debt to future generations.
Unsurprisingly both the UK government and opposition drew from those quotes to claim the President's support for their arguments.
Labour said David Cameron would be disappointed the President had refused to support his economic policy.
Government sources suggested he had said everything they would have said about the need for countries to live within their means while protecting spending on infrastructure and technology.
The inevitable arguments about what President Obama really meant, underlined a simple point.
No one could emerge from this state visit doubting America's influence; certainly not David Cameron who hitched a lift in the famous Presidential limousine.
The special relationship, described repeatedly as "essential" during the visit, retains its place at the centre of British foreign policy.
The announcements about collaboration between the US and the UK made public during the press conference served, of course, to underline the point.
As the pageantry and press conferences of the visit played out, the vast US aircraft carrier the USS George H.W. Bush was off the British coast taking part in a major international military training exercise.
Some in David Cameron's party will watch the president leave for the G8 in France wishing the US had promised to commit a little more of that force to the fight to oust Colonel Gaddafi.

article Justice N Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court made the remark while rejecting a plea by a British national accused of sexually abusing a boy
Three children were raped in Delhi earlier this month, sparking outrage.
Two years ago, India tightened its laws on sexual violence after the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
"When [the] law is ineffective and incapable of addressing the menace, this court cannot keep its hands folded and remain a silent spectator, unmoved and oblivious of the recent happenings of horrible blood-curdling gang rapes of children in various parts of India," Mr Kirubakaran said on Friday.
He said the "court is sure the castration of child rapists will fetch magical results" in curbing crimes against children.
"Though the suggestion of castration looks barbaric, barbaric crimes should definitely attract barbaric models of punishment and the very thought of the punishment should deter the culprit from committing the offence," Mr Kirubakaran said.
He made the observation while dismissing a petition by a British national accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy from the southern state of Tamil Nadu in 2011 after promising his mother that he would take care of his education.
The man, who has returned to Britain, had urged the high court to suspend the proceedings against him in a lower court in Tamil Nadu.

article Friday's South Coast Proms concert was cancelled due to bad weather, with ticket holders offered a refund plus free entry to Saturday's pop concert.
It drew criticism from those who had already paid to attend Saturday's show.
Organisers said the free tickets were a "gesture of goodwill" but made no comment about the complaints.
The two concerts are to mark the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie begins Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup.
Organisers issued a statement on Friday explaining the South Coast Proms concert, featuring the Band of HM Royal Marines, was cancelled for "public safety reasons".
It added it would refund all Friday evening tickets, which cost ¬£25, as well as offer them free tickets for the Portsmouth Live! concert featuring Spandau Ballet, Wet Wet Wet and McBusted.
Those with Saturday tickets - which cost up to ¬£48.50 - took to the event's own Facebook page to complain.
On Friday Martine Halliday posted: "I have paid ¬£131 for three tickets and people who bought tickets for tonight get a full refund and free entry into tomorrow's event. Come on, seriously, sort this out!!!"
Jan Spencer, who said she paid ¬£200 for Saturday tickets, posted: "To give people free tickets to a completely different concert as well as a refund is disgraceful. I'm so very annoyed".
Andy Cottrell posted that the handling of the issue was a "shambles".
Others complained about the prospect of more people attending the Saturday concert, potentially making it crowded and cramped.
A concerts spokeswoman said: "We offered the Saturday night tickets as a gesture of goodwill to many of those who had travelled to Portsmouth and, due to inclement weather conditions, had missed out on their concert opportunity."

Maersk Oil said it was part of a drive to reduce operating costs by 20% by the end of 2016.
The UK jobs are linked to the retirement of the Janice installation, 150 miles south-east of Aberdeen, and changes to the offshore rotation.
Maersk is also scaling back its business in Qatar and Norway, as well as at its Copenhagen headquarters, and in Kazakhstan.
The company said the move followed an "extensive internal review of business activities and continued low oil prices".
Chief executive Jakob Thomasen said: "These are difficult decisions and my immediate concern is for the welfare of those affected."

article Each unprotected department has been asked to come up with savings plans of 25% and 40% of their budget.
The chancellor said departments had also been asked to help meet a target of 150,000 new homes on public sector land by 2020.
The NHS and per-pupil schools budgets will be protected in the review, which will be published on 25 November.
Mr Osborne, who gave evidence to MPs on Tuesday about the Budget and his spending priorities, said that "with careful management of public money, we can get more for less".
The Treasury said "large savings" would be required of unprotected departments, which have been asked to model two scenarios: of 25% and 40% cuts to their budgets by 2020.
The BBC's economics editor Robert Peston said what was being proposed would require a reinvention of some services taken for granted by the public.
Mr Osborne has already unveiled ¬£12bn of welfare savings plus ¬£5bn of tax avoidance prevention measures - which together with the ¬£20bn of departmental spending cuts make up the ¬£37bn figure earmarked to get government finances back in the black.
Analysis by economics editor Robert Peston
Today I want you to imagine what you would cut from your lifestyle if told that your income would fall by either 25% or 40%, after adjusting for inflation, over the next four years.
It is quite a scary thought, isn't it? Presumably, if you haven't done it already, you'll think about switching the weekly shop to one of those discounters. You will heat up the water for fewer hours. And the kids' swimming lessons will have to go.
But those savings would not even scratch the surface of a 40% cut. To reach that, the kids may have to share a bedroom, so you can take in a paying lodger. And the car would be history.
All of which serves to explain why ministers and officials in all but protected departments and services - that is everything but health, schools, defence and overseas aid - are having panic attacks today.
Because they have been instructed by the chancellor to "model" the impact on the services they provide of finding savings of either 25% or 40% by 2019-20 - or ¬£20bn per annum of cuts in aggregate.  This is the stuff of public-service reinvention, not efficiency.

Spending limits will be set for government departments, which will also be asked to examine the way they manage their assets and consider privatisation and contracting out where necessary.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said talk of cuts of as much as 40% were just "a ranging shot".
"Past experience would suggest that initial pitching by the Treasury should be regarded as aspirational," he told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
"But it is clear that to deliver the overall fiscal trajectory departments collectively will have to make substantial savings, double-digit percentage savings."
The review document says it will prioritise spending which: promotes innovation and greater collaboration in public services; promotes growth and productivity including through devolution within England; promotes choice and competition and which drive efficiency and value for money.
Although full details will not be published until November, the document does include some details of specific areas for change.
On local government it says "the government will look at transforming the approach" to its financing and "further decentralising power, in order to maximise efficiency, local economic growth and the integration of public services".
It also sets out plans to sell off publicly owned land that is surplus to requirements, including assets owned by the Ministry of Defence.
The Treasury said the MoD, alone, accounted for 1% of all land in the UK, while the state land holdings were worth ¬£300bn.
Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock told the BBC that ¬£1.5bn of land had been disposed of during the last Parliament and that ministers had only "just started getting going".
"It is clear we can release much, much more," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. "It also contributes to our wider objectives like housebuilding. The two go hand in hand."
But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the scale of the cuts envisaged meant it would take a lot more than "flogging off a few disused airbases" to meet the chancellor's targets.
For Labour, shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told BBC News: "During the Budget speech the chancellor said that he was going to step off the rollercoaster ride in public spending and now he's asking his cabinet colleagues to perhaps think about deeper cuts than he envisaged only a fortnight ago.
"So it's very unclear what the chancellor's coherent approach is here and I think we do need, of course, those sensible savings but he needs to now come clean and say what exactly is he planning."
The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie said some of the targets set for departments were likely to prove "completely unmanageable" and Mr Osborne risked "setting himself up for a very large fall".
"Perhaps he's setting the bar high and he'll appear to be the good guy if it's less when push comes to shove," he said. "I think the key thing is we look at the last parliament. He failed on all these major targets.
"He seems to be wanting to push the boundaries time after time after time. There's no longer fat to be cut. It's into the bone and the impact on services could be catastrophic."

article It failed to pass on the last day of the previous assembly after opposition from Plaid Cymru.
Carwyn Jones told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement the bill would be tabled again without the e-cigs ban.
He said Labour's minority government would also have to rethink its council shake-up plans to win wider support.
"There is no point trying to bang our heads against a brick wall when it comes to e-cigs," he said.
"The public health bill will be brought back to the assembly but, clearly, there is no point including the provisions on e-cigs when we know they are not going to get through."
His comments come at the start of a new assembly term with the minority government requiring support from other parties to pass through plans.
Tobacco control action group ASH Wales has welcomed the minister's decision. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: "The evidence shows that e-cigs are being used as a cessation tool by a significant number of ex-smokers."
The Public Health (Wales) Bill failed to pass at the last assembly after the presiding officer was required, because of a tie, to also vote, bringing the vote to 27 AMs against and 26 for.
As well as the e-cigarette measure, it aimed to create a compulsory licensing system for tattooists, prohibit intimate piercing of children under 16 and require councils to produce a local toilets strategy.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was "delighted that Labour has been forced to admit that they won't be pursuing this misguided policy".
The failed vote came despite AMs previously backing revised e-cigarette plans.
On local government reorganisation plans, the first minister admitted he would now need to find "common ground" with the other political parties in the Senedd.
Labour has long hoped to cut the number of authorities from 22 to single figures which has been opposed by the Conservatives among others.
He said: "Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious.
"But we do need to find a way forward."
Meanwhile, he was adamant that a preferred option for a new M4 relief road south of Newport, known as the black route, was the only way forward.
However, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has previously ruled out any kind of deal with Labour if it pushed the proposals forward.
Speaking on BBC Wales' Sunday Politics, Ms Wood said: "Danger faces the government if it continues to be intransigent".
She said it will need the backing of another party to get policies passed, adding that Plaid Cymru's 12 AMs would "consider very carefully what we do with our votes".
Carwyn Jones said he was just reflecting the arithmetic of the assembly in accepting that there wouldn't be enough support to push ahead with a ban on e-cigs in Wales and cutting the number of councils.
Having Kirsty Williams in the cabinet helps him with the numbers but the first minister has to choose his battles because he needs support from the opposition in order to get his policies, and budgets, through a vote in the Senedd.
Mr Jones says he won't budge on the M4 relief road, which means there's a real stalemate between him and Plaid Cymru. He wants their support on the budget, so it seems something will have to give.
Another tricky situation for Mr Jones is the agreement with Plaid Cymru which paved the way for him to be re-appointed as first minister.
Today we've seen how little detail there was in the agreement. Plaid want more doctors and a big commission to look at infrastructure. Carwyn Jones seemed cool on the idea of the latter, and unclear what Plaid wanted on the former.
With so little detail in the deal, I asked Leanne Wood if she had been conned by the first minister to get into power.  Her answer: "I don't think so." If she starts to think otherwise, Carwyn Jones could find life difficult in the Senedd if the only other left-leaning party refuses to work with him.

article Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan secured 68% of shares in July this year, with the trust retaining 21.1%.
The supporters claim they were not consulted and were not able to buy more shares themselves.
A statement on the Trust's website said it had received legal advice, but no decision had been taken.
"We are conscious any legal action would create uncertainty," the statement said.
"Our first preference has always revolved around protecting our shareholding and influence at the football club.
"[Legal action] remains a last resort, however we have a duty to our members for the best long-term interests of our fans."
The Trust members felt they were not informed of the sale of shares at an early enough stage, and their efforts to increase their own holding to 25% were rebuffed.
Their criticism is not just of Kaplan and Levien but of the previous board members who sold their shares to the Americans.
The Trust was also critical of the majority shareholders over the sacking of manager Francesco Guidolin, and the appointment of successor Bob Bradley.
The Supporters' Trust forum held at the Liberty Stadium was told a barrister had given initial advice, which was still being assessed.
"Our legal options are still being assessed and we will obtain the best guidance we can to ensure the Trust members' best interests are maintained.
"Whilst we have sought an initial opinion from counsel, we have not yet made any firm decisions in terms of the next steps to be taken."
Any legal action against the new owners or the previous shareholders would need the full approval of the Trust Members via a forum or ballot.
Swansea City have so far declined to comment.

"These things take time, to understand how people want to work, and Pierre understands the players.
"This is purely around performance. When you step to that white line, I can't help and Pierre can't help the players. These guys are pro cricketers and they've got to go out and do it for themselves."
All-rounder Neil Dexter did not feature against Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire but Khan said his absence was because of "personal issues".
He continued: "People will like to spin conspiracy theories and rumours like he's fallen out with the coach over this and that but it's not the case.
"Pierre and I speak to Neil on a daily basis and we're supporting him through a difficult personal situation that he's got from a family point of view.
"As soon as he is back and he is firing, he will be back playing."
De Bruyn, 40, was promoted to head coach in 2016 after predecessor Andrew McDonald left to coach Australian side Melbourne Renegades.
Despite Leicestershire's winless run this campaign, Khan insists de Bruyn can turn the club's fortunes around.
"I believe in Pierre in terms of his coaching ability, his philosophies and he's passionate about the Foxes," he added.
"He's doing everything he can and he has my full support. Nothing will change overnight so now's not the time to panic."

article The suit alleges that some employees were fired from one franchise because there were "too many black people".
It is being backed by a group campaigning for better wages for fast-food workers and the local Virginia National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
McDonald's has not yet commented specifically on the suit.
McDonalds issued a general statement, saying: "McDonald's has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity of employees, independent franchisees, customers and suppliers, and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values.
"McDonald's and our independent owner-operators share a commitment to the well-being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald's restaurants."
The suit is part of a continuing effort on the part of labour organisers to hold McDonald's responsible for the behaviour of its franchisees.
McDonald's and other restaurant groups have argued that it should not be held responsible for the behaviour and labour practices of franchisees.
However, their position has been weakened by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
It ruled that McDonalds "could be held jointly liable for labour and wage violations by its franchise operators" in July.
Since then, current and former employees have filed lawsuits against many McDonald's franchises and the larger corporation alleging wage theft and other illegal practices.
In the lawsuit filed in Virginia on Thursday, which is not part of the NLRB's larger activity, 10 former employees - nine of whom are African-American and one of whom is Hispanic - allege that they were subject to "rampant racial and sexual harassment" by supervisors at three restaurants run by McDonald's franchisee Michael Simon.
Mr Simon became franchise operator of the three restaurants in late 2013, when the majority of the employees at the restaurants were African-American.
Soon after, the suit alleges Mr Simon instituted a plan to hire more white employees, with supervisors allegedly telling employees that the restaurants were "too dark" and they needed to hire new employees to "get the ghetto out of the store".
Subsequently, in mid-2014, a large number of white employees were hired and several of the African-American employees who are part of the suit were fired.
The fired workers alleged that when they attempted to contact McDonald's corporate office, there was no response.
McDonald's is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings before US markets open on Friday.

article Retired teacher Roger Whitworth compiled a huge dossier of pictures of the Worcester City Ancient Arms and the Worcester City Modern Arms.
The heraldic emblems can be seen on buildings, bins, benches, gates and even a radiator cover.
The city council received the Corporate Heraldry Award at a ceremony in London.
The accolade, sponsored by the national Heraldry Society is given twice a year to recognise how coats of arms strengthen a place or organisation's identity.
Worcester City's ancient arms feature a castle while the modern arms have the addition of three black pears.
Mr Whitworth, a former lecturer who runs a genealogy business, entered the city for the award.
He wrote in detail about how the people of Worcester identify the council and the city using the crests.
Floreat Semper Fidelis Civitas - Let the faithful city ever flourish
Civitas in bello et pace fidelis  - In war and peace, a faithful city
Semper fidelis mutare sperno  - Ever faithful, I scorn to change
"We are delighted that Worcester's commitment to its heraldic heritage and the importance of the city crest has been recognised nationally," said Councillor Lucy Hodgson, the council's cabinet member for history and heritage.
"This award can only help to strengthen Worcester's case to gain Heritage City status in 2016."

article Rugby union to the uninitiated, football-fanatic teenager is a mystifying thing. But could a home World Cup in England change that?
Some of the children at Loreto High School in Manchester could hardly afford boots when their PE teacher James Hyland introduced rugby three years ago.
But the Rugby Football Union's (RFU) All Schools programme has enabled 400 state secondary schools, including Loreto, to afford to get rugby off the ground - as well as some footwear.
"The kids had never touched a rugby ball in their lives," says Hyland, whose school has gone from having no rugby union, to fielding a boys' team at every age level and fostering a link with local amateur club Broughton Park.
"We had our first training session and they were throwing the ball forwards, trying to trip people up as they went past and wearing their old trainers.
"It was starting with the basics. Some of them had never even seen a game on TV."
The lack of rugby at Loreto High School puzzled student Calum Conner Jones, a winger for Broughton Park, when he joined. So he did something about it.
"I asked if we could start a rugby team. I had a chat with Mr Hyland and they were all for it," says the 15-year-old.
"A lot of the boys weren't really bothered about rugby. They wouldn't have even known there was a club down the road.
"Now a lot of them go and play. One guy had never played before and after a year had a trial with Lancashire."
Union, for so long derided for its reputation as a game for the privileged, has struggled to gain traction in football-dominated state schools, particularly in the north.
"One of our greatest objectives was to change the perception that rugby is an exclusive sport - and it is a perception," says Steve Grainger, the RFU's development director.
"We wanted to really hit schools that perhaps rugby could have the greatest impact on - ones with low numbers of A-C grades at GCSE and free school meals - they're a good indicator of a school's social-economic background."
Loreto, according to Hyland, has a diverse student population, with about "30-40%" from middle-class backgrounds and the remainder from "very deprived" backgrounds.
It sits on the fringes of leafy Didsbury and the poorer inner-city areas of Moss Side and Whalley Range.
Broughton's link with the school has seen the club stretch its demographic beyond its traditional, private school recruitment.
Last year, Broughton had six players in its under-six programme - this season they have 21. And most of their U15s and U16s players have come through the All Schools programme.
"We are such a mix of social diversity. We have children that go to public school but we also have children that go to state schools," says youth secretary Pippa Ranson.
"They're out there and they just play. Some children have gone to grammars, some to comprehensives, they're still playing rugby together."
Teacher Hyland came to realise the gap between the most privileged and impoverished of his students when he took a group on a funded trip to Twickenham.
"One boy lives with his granddad and has never been out of Manchester," says Hyland, who himself plays for North Manchester.
"I don't think he'd stayed in a hotel before and was like 'I've got my own bathroom?'.
"At breakfast he piled his plate with everything. He didn't understand the concept of a buffet breakfast - he had never seen one. That for me was the main eye opener of how deprived some of the children are.
"He's really come out of his shell now since playing rugby."
There are, of course, gaps in the system. Loreto has undoubtedly excelled at starting rugby in the school because it has a PE teacher who is passionate about the sport.
Other schools would not have found it as easy - although just two schools of the 400 that have taken funding have dropped out of the system.
There have also been missed opportunities. The Uruguay squad used Broughton as a training base before their group game against England in Manchester, but none of the club's youngsters were given an opportunity to interact with the World Cup players.
That was, admittedly, down to tournament organisers and not the RFU - and local children did interact with England players in Eccles just days after the hosts' disappointing exit from the competition.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Then there is the question of where girls fit into the equation.
The RFU says one in three children affected by the All Schools programme are girls - a figure Grainger describes as "light years ahead of where we were a decade ago".
Regardless of how corporate strategies and development targets are played out, the 2015 World Cup's biggest influence on youngsters could well be its spectacle - the action seen in stadiums and on TV from arguably the greatest union World Cup of all time.
Clubs were warned to expect an upturn in interest of 33% during the World Cup, although we might never know whether curiosity towards the sport was dampened by England's early exit.
Regardless, it is how that interest endures, years down the line, that will be the true test of the World Cup's legacy.
"The reports from rugby clubs I've been to have said they've had more youngsters come down," said Grainger.
"I've seen more kids throwing rugby balls around than I've ever seen before.
"If by 2019 we don't have more membership at clubs and more children playing in schools, we'll be saying it won't have worked. But I'll expect more people to be playing rugby."
summary A World Cup in England is a chance to change that.

article Kirkersville police Chief Steven Eric Disario, 36 - only recently appointed - was among the dead, his deputies told US media.
Two employees were found dead inside the Pine Kirk Care Center, and Disario was found outside the building.
The authorities have not given a motive for the shooting, and have not identified the other victims.
It is unclear if the gunman killed himself or whether he had a relationship with any of the victims.
Disario had only taken over the job about three weeks ago, Licking County Sheriff Randy Thorp told reporters on Friday afternoon.
He had six children, and one more "on the way", Mr Thorp said, adding that "it's a real hard day for all of us".
"It's just a tragic event," Mr Thorp said, adding that Disario had been responding to reports of a man with a gun when he was shot around 08:00 local time.
"I believe the last radio transmission we had from (Disario) was that he had the subject in sight," he said.
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the accused shooter took two hostages in an alley, but both were released unharmed.
The 23 residents of the nursing home, who barricaded themselves inside during the shooting, have been moved so that investigators can analyse the crime scene.
Kirkersville is a small village about 25 miles (40km) outside Columbus, the capital of Ohio.
A primary school near the shooting scene was placed on lockdown, and classes were later cancelled for the day.
Governor John Kasich has taken to Twitter to pay his condolences, also ordering that flags at the state capitol fly at half-mast.
"Ohio mourns the loss of Kirkersville Chief Eric Disario, who died in the line of duty," he wrote, adding "blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God".

"The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10, but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.
"The recapture of this prisoner is now a matter for the police."
Byrne was sentenced in 2008 to a total of nine years' imprisonment for burglary, robbery and theft.
Officers in Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, have appealed for anyone with information about Byrne's whereabouts to get in touch.
Byrne is described as white and of medium build, with blue eyes and a goatee beard.

article About 90 machine gun rounds were fired at the object, which has not been identified. North Korea has flown drones over the border in the past.
In a statement, the South Korean military said it was "maintaining high vigilance".
The incident comes amid continuing high tension on the Korean peninsula.
On Sunday Pyongyang conducted what it said was a successful test of a medium-range ballistic missile.
That test came a week after North Korea tested what it said was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead.
The pace of North Korean missile tests has increased in recent months and experts fear it indicates progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could strike the continental US.
The UN Security Council is to hold a closed-door meeting on North Korea on Tuesday evening. In a statement on Monday, it agreed to "take further significant measures including sanctions" to force North Korea to end its "highly destabilising behaviour".
The spike in tensions comes with a new president in South Korea. Moon Jae-in was sworn into office earlier this month after the previous leader, Park Geun-hye, was impeached. She is now on trial for corruption.
Mr Moon has adopted a more conciliatory stance than his predecessor, calling for more dialogue with the North.
South Korean military officials did not say whether they hit or secured the object that flew across the demilitarised zone, but similar incidents have occurred in the past.
In January 2016, South Korean border troops fired shots at a suspected drone.
In 2014, South Korean officials said they found two North Korean drones, one south of the demilitarised zone near Paju and the other on an island near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border.

article In Vanity Fair magazine, Monica Lewinsky, 40, writes that she deeply regrets the fling.
The president "took advantage" of her, she writes, though she describes their relationship as consensual.
In 1998, Republicans failed in their effort to oust him from office on the grounds he had lied about the affair.
But with Mr Clinton's wife Hillary said to be mulling a 2016 run for the presidency, the Lewinsky matter has re-emerged in US political discourse, in part because Republicans are eager to wield it against her.
In an advance excerpt from the article released by Vanity Fair, Ms Lewinsky writes she hopes to reclaim her story and says she is still recognised every day and sees her name thrown about in pop culture and the news media.
"I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton," she writes.
"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened."
Ms Lewinsky writes that she suffered abuse and humiliation after the scandal broke in 1998, in part because she was made a "scapegoat" to protect the president.
"The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me," she wrote.
"And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power."
Since leaving the Clinton administration, she worked briefly as a handbag designer and as the host of a US reality dating show.
Ms Lewinsky then moved to London for a graduate degree, but said she has had difficulty gaining employment in the US because of her past.
Arguing Mr Clinton had lied to federal investigators about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky, who was in her early 20s, the Republicans in the House of Representatives impeached the president, essentially bringing him up on charges in the Senate to determine whether he could be expelled from office.
That effort failed, and Mr Clinton served in the White House until his term ended in 2000.
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, went on to be elected US senator and to serve as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and is currently tipped as a frontrunner for the Democratic 2016 presidential nomination.
The Republicans have indicated recently that Mr Clinton's affair with Ms Lewinsky will be fair game should Mrs Clinton indeed run.
Republican Senator Rand Paul - also tipped to run for the presidency in 2016 - said this year that "bosses shouldn't prey on young interns in their office".
Mr Clinton "took advantage of a girl that was 20-years-old and an intern in his office", he added. "There is no excuse for that and that is predatory behaviour."
In her piece, Ms Lewinsky signals that her desire in breaking her silence after so many years is to "give a purpose" to her past.
"Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation," she writes.
Ms Lewinsky now aims "to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums".

article Unemployed father-of-17 Philpott was jailed for life on Thursday for killing six of his children in a house fire.
Mr Osborne said there was a "question for government and society" about the influence of benefits on behaviour.
But Labour condemned the comments as "a cynical act of a desperate chancellor".
Philpott was convicted of manslaughter, along with his wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley, over an arson revenge plot that went wrong.
Much of the coverage of the trial focused on Philpott's lifestyle and the fact that his wife and his mistress Lisa Willis had lived with him at the three-bedroom council house in Derby with 11 of their children until Miss Willis moved out in February 2012.
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
When politicians talk about a subject as shocking as the Philpott case they know they will grab voters' attention.
George Osborne has sent out the message that he thinks there is a link between Mick Philpott's lifestyle and the welfare debate.
Ed Balls has accused Osborne of playing politics with a human tragedy.
There are risks for both sides.
Voters may think the Conservatives are making political hay from a unique and horrific crime.
They may think Labour sounds insufficiently tough on welfare.
Or they may just think this is another round in a long fight between two big political beasts.
Philpott received more than ??8,000 a year in child benefit for his 11 children, as well as the income support and wages paid to his wife and mistress, which went into his bank account.
He had already achieved tabloid notoriety as "Shameless Mick" and "Britain's biggest scrounger" before his trial began.
In 2006 he appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show, on ITV, to demand a bigger council house.
Mr Osborne, who has been defending government cuts to housing benefit and other welfare changes, which came into force this week, said: "Philpott is responsible for these absolutely horrendous crimes and these are crimes that have shocked the nation; the courts are responsible for sentencing him.
"But I think there is a question for government and for society about the welfare state - and the taxpayers who pay for the welfare state - subsidising lifestyles like that, and I think that debate needs to be had."
But, in a blog post, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls was highly critical of his opposite number, saying: "George Osborne's calculated decision to use the shocking and vile crimes of Mick Philpott to advance a political argument is the cynical act of a desperate chancellor."
Mr Balls demanded "a proper debate about welfare reform".
"But for the chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office," he added.
Former Liberal Democrat education minister Sarah Teather joined in the criticism, saying she was "shocked and appalled that George Osborne has stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic deaths of six young children".
"It is deeply irresponsible for such a senior politician to seek to capitalise on public anger about this case, and in doing so demonise anybody who receives any kind of welfare support," the MP for Brent Central said.
"Mr Philpott should be held fully accountable for his awful actions and it is reprehensible to seek to explain it away by blaming the welfare system which Osborne has been so happy to wage war on."
But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps backed the chancellor.
He said: "I think we should be proud of having a welfare system that looks after the most vulnerable in our society.  It's a proper safety net.  Of course there a proper debate to be had about where this should begin and end, and of course that case highlighted some of the extremes."
Philpott has been told he will serve a minimum of 15 years in prison, while Mairead and Mosley were told they would serve at least half of their 17-year sentences.
During the trial, the prosecuting lawyer told the jury: "Michael Philpott did not want to work. He just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings."
Mr Osborne has dismissed claims that his benefit reforms mark the end of the welfare state as "shrill, headline-seeking nonsense", arguing instead that they encourage people to work rather than rely on payments.

article United Utilities needs to stop taking supplies from Ennerdale Water in the Lake District, which is a protected wildlife  habitat.
Instead it wants a new 62-mile (100km) pipeline from Thirlmere reservoir to provide water to about 150,000 people.
Allerdale Council is the final local authority in the county to approve the company's planning application.
United Utilities estimates the project, which also includes new treatment works and pumping stations, will create about 400 jobs.
Areas around Whitehaven, Egremont, Workington, Maryport, Cockermouth and Wigton will receive their water via the new pipeline when it is completed in 2022.
The route will roughly follow the A591 from Thirlmere to a planned new treatment works near Cockermouth.
The plan was approved by Allerdale Council despite objections from several groups including Friends of the Lake District and the Ramblers, who claimed it would significantly damage the landscape.
United Utilities said water extraction from Ennerdale had to stop to meet EU environmental regulations and to prevent predicted shortages to supplies.
A spokesman added: "This is the culmination of several years of detailed planning and consultation.
"We've worked to develop a scheme which delivers major long-term benefits for west Cumbria, while seeking to minimise traffic inconvenience and safeguarding the environment during construction.
"The new scheme will ease the pressure on sensitive local water sources and provide a more secure supply for homes and businesses for the decades to come."
Work on the new pipeline is due to begin in March 2017.

article Back then, some 2,500 people died and more than 7,000 were injured. Thankfully, we are not expecting loss of life on that scale here.
In part this is because of the strides made in recent years in improving readiness and reaction.
But the fact that the population of central Italy is currently living on such an acute alert status also will have further limited any dreadful consequences.
We have now seen three Magnitude-6 tremors in Italy's Apennines region in just three months.
Quakes 'ever present for Apennines'
BBC Science: Earthquakes
The first, in August, was a 6.2. This was followed mid-week by a 6.1. Initial calculations put Sunday's event at 6.6, which in terms of the energy released is actually four times bigger than the quake in August.
Every time there is a rumble, the population's response will be rapid, and saved seconds save lives.
For example, Wednesday's tremor was immediately preceded by a 5.5 foreshock, which would have had many people scurrying for the open streets, putting them safely out of harm's way when the big tremor hit two hours later.
Many Apennines residents will of course be asking why there have been so many large quakes in so short a time frame. But this is often how the geology works.
"This is an earthquake sequence; these are related events," explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK.
"And this triggering of multiple events, sometimes a few days or weeks apart, is well known behaviour."
Look back to 1997 or as far back as 1703, and this clustering in time and space is seen in the same region of Italy.
Scientists are having to move fast, though, to keep on top of what exactly is occurring and to try to join the dots.
The big picture is reasonably well understood. Wider tectonic forces in the Earth's crust have led to the Apennines being pulled apart at a rate of roughly 3mm per year - about a 10th of the speed at which your fingernails grow.
But this stress is then spread across a multitude of different faults that cut through the mountains. And this network is fiendishly complicated.
It does now look as though August's event broke two neighbouring faults, starting on one known as the Laga and then jumping across to one called the Vettore.
The mid-week tremors appear to have further broken the northern end of the Vettore. But both in August and mid-week, it seems only the top portions of the faults have gone, and the big question is whether the deeper segments have now failed in the latest event.
Experts on the ground will be looking for scarps where the soil has split. Dr Laura Gregory from Leeds University, UK, is currently on the scene.
"We're doing monitoring using GPS receivers to look at how the ground is moving in the aftermath of these events.
"We're also looking at the surface expression of the earthquake as well because this can tell you a lot about earthquakes in general and about the earthquakes in this region," she told BBC News.
"It's very important research to do. We still don't really know enough about these earthquakes and we want to get better at forecasting them."
If Sunday's event has broken the lower portions of the faults then surface evidence may be sparse.
Further information will come from the radar satellites that will overfly the Apennines region in the coming days to map the quake zone.
Their pictures will be compared with space images acquired before Sunday's big tremor to see how the rocks have moved.
Europe's Sentinel-1 mission was launched specifically with this kind of work in mind.
Sentinel-1 actually comprises two spacecraft that have already revealed considerable insight into the August quake and its connection with Wednesday's double tremor.
One of the satellites is due to sweep over the Apennines again on Monday.
"We'll then know if it is the deeper extent of both faults that has gone this time," said Dr Walters.
"This would be what we call 'depth segmentation' where the shallow portions break followed by the deeper portions. And it means you can have an earthquake repeating more frequently on the same faults."

article A newly established group has been chosen by Brighton and Hove City Council to run the parade and ticketed festival in Preston Park.
Pride Brighton and Hove will donate √Ç¬£1 of every ticket sold to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender charities.
In areport the council said the event had not been "financially successful"for the previous organisers, Pride South East.
The event, which is usually held in August, will now take place on 1 September due to pressures from the London 2012 Olympics.
One of the organisers, Michael Deol, said the festival was integral to Brighton's economy.
"The annual event has ensured a fantastic summer boom for businesses across the city from guest houses and hotels to restaurants, shops and clubs," he said.
A council spokeswoman said it received two proposals for running Pride.
"Pride Brighton and Hove are a new community interest company that has committed to ring fence a proportion of ticket income from the planned park event to go directly to charity to benefit the local LGBT community," she said.
"Pride is an important event for the city - not only for residents and visitors but also our economy."

article The 24-year-old England international is now committed to the Premier League club until 2021 and there is the option to extend the deal by a further year.
Lingard has made 70 appearances for United, who he joined as a seven-year-old, and won four caps for his country.
"Manchester United has always been a big part of my life," said Lingard.
"I feel great pride every time I pull the shirt on."
Lingard holds the rare distinction of scoring in three successive games for his club at Wembley.
After netting the winner in last season's FA Cup final, Lingard also scored against Leicester in the Community Shield and Southampton as United won the EFL Cup in February.
"To have scored in two cup finals for my boyhood club were immensely proud moments for me and my family," he added.
"As a team, we have already won a major trophy this season and I look forward to helping us win many more under this great manager."
United boss Jose Mourinho said: "Jesse is a popular member of the squad and I am delighted he has signed a new contract.
"He has good intelligence which, when combined with his energy and ability, makes for a player with a great future ahead of him."
Lingard had spells on loan at Leicester, Birmingham and Brighton before he was given his first-team debut by Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal against Swansea in the opening game of the 2014-15 season.
This season he has played 29 times, scoring five goals.

article Lisa Cobbold, 24, was pictured with non-league side Needham Market after a bridge collapse closed the M20 in Kent.
The team did not get her name but wanted to know if she made it to her wedding.
When friends saw her picture, she contacted the BBC from Las Vegas.
The Suffolk-based team, who were heading to an away game at Folkestone when they got stuck in the traffic jam on 27 August, were delighted to hear she became Mrs Kendall later that day - albeit two hours later than planned.
More news from Suffolk
Mrs Kendall, from Welling, London, was heading to Detling when her two wedding vehicles, decked in ribbons, ground to a halt.
"I wasn't too worried as we were 15 minutes away, but then people showed us news reports about the bridge," she said.
The pedestrian bridge over the M20 collapsed after being hit by a lorry carrying a digger.
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when he threw himself from his bike to avoid hitting the bridge.
Mrs Kendall spotted the football team watching an impromptu cricket game on the closed carriageway.
"I didn't know who they were, but they were lovely lads and even said we could use the toilet on their coach," she said.
She had her photograph taken with them and the team later posted it on their website, saying they wanted to make sure she got to the church on time and congratulate her.
"Jake and I were on our honeymoon in Las Vegas when I got all these messages from people saying I was on the news.
"I said to Jake, 'it's OK, I'm only on the BBC'."
Mrs Kendall had made it to her wedding two hours late after part of the road was reopened.
"Everyone parted and let us go first. The football players all cheered as we drove through," she said.
Mrs Kendall, who changed into her wedding gown at the venue, said her husband-to be joked: "You like to keep me waiting, don't you. I thought you'd stood me up."
Mark Easlea, Needham Market FC's secretary, said the team "wishes them all the best for the future".

article A total of 67 families will be represented by the same legal team as they seek compensation over the scandal at Aberdeen's Hazlehead Crematorium.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
Aberdeen City Council announced in December last year that it had approved a new financial compensation scheme for those affected.
The deadline for claims has been set for 1 February.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
It followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
A report into the scandal by Dame Elish Angiolini described the practices as "abhorrent".
Thompsons Solicitors said they originally represented 21 families but that had risen to 67 as the compensation deadline looms.
Company partner Patrick McGuire said the compensation announcement was justification for the families "who had fought for years to get the council to acknowledge the wrongs done to them".
He added: "I have rarely seen such a large amount of people contacting us in such a short space of time.
"I think what this actually shows is the number of families in the Aberdeen area that have been touched by this scandal and have suffered in silence. They no longer need to do so."

article Christopher Meli, 20, was discovered on Saturday near houses at Glasvey Close.
Police said the youths, two aged 18 and one aged 16, had been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.
They are also investigating a serious assault on another young man who was in the company of Mr Meli.
He was taken to hospital, but later discharged.
Mr Meli's mother Vanessa Burke said her son was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"I believe that Christopher died a very violent death," she said.
"I know in my heart and soul he was calling me, I believe he was calling me, or both of us. Me and Christopher were close, anyone who knows us, knows how close we were."
Speaking on Sunday, Det Ch Insp Gareth Talbot said: "After examination by ambulance staff the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A number of injuries were noted on the body and as such, we are treating this death as murder."
Police appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
John McPoland from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said a crew attended the scene.
"At 12:50 GMT on Saturday the ambulance service received a call from a resident in the Glasvey Close area reporting that there was a young man lying on the street with blood coming from his head," he said.
"He did indicate to us at the time that he felt the young man was dead.
"We did send a crew up to the scene and unfortunately they found that the person was deceased at the scene and they stayed until the police arrived and assisted the police as best they could."
Sinn F√É¬©in MLA Jennifer McCann said she was "shocked" to hear about the death.
"I have spoken to the local PSNI and they tell me they are treating it as a violent death," she said.
"My thoughts and prayers are with this young man's family at this time and I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward to the PSNI."

article The 40-year-old from South Lanarkshire had been in a "stable" condition at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
She was put on an RAF Hercules aircraft which took her to London where she was taken to  the Royal Free Hospital.
Ms Cafferkey was treated there twice in 2015 after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone the previous year.
A spokesman for the Royal Free said she had been transferred to the hospital "due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus".
The spokesman added: "She will now be treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team under nationally agreed guidelines.
"The Ebola virus can only be transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person while they are symptomatic so the risk to the general public remains low and the NHS has well established and practised infection control procedures in place."
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said Ms Cafferkey had been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow "under routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Unit".
The health board said she was "undergoing further investigations and her condition remains stable".
Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "I'd like to thank the expert NHS staff in Glasgow who have looked after her and helped with her transfer to the Royal Free Hospital, where Pauline has been treated before and where clinicians agreed it would be best to continue her treatment."
The nurse, from Halfway, Cambuslang, contracted the virus while working as part of a British team at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre.
She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free at the beginning of 2015 after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.
Ms Cafferkey was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, and in March 2015 returned to work as a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.
In October last year it was discovered that Ebola was still present in her body, with health officials later confirming she had been diagnosed with meningitis caused by the virus.
Ebola is a viral illness of which the initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And that is just the beginning: subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding.
The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.
It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.
Ebola outbreaks occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, says the WHO.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014, and rapidly became the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.
Almost two years on from the first confirmed case recorded on 23 March 2014, more than 11,000 people have been reported as having died from the disease in six countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali.
The total number of reported cases is almost 29,000.
On 13 January, 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the last of the countries affected, Liberia, to be Ebola-free.
Bodily tissues can harbour the Ebola infection months after the person appears to have fully recovered.
Dr Derek Gatherer, lecturer in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University, said it was "now becoming clear that Ebola is a far more complex disease than we previously imagined".
He said: "The meningitis that Ms Cafferkey suffered from at the end of last year is one of the most serious complications of all, as it can be life-threatening.
"The other main rare serious complication is inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis and/or uveitis) which can lead to blindness, especially if supportive treatments are unavailable."
Dr Gatherer said major post-recovery complications included "joint aches, headaches and general tiredness which can last for months".

article The GM Health and Social Care Partnership Board said the move would make 24/7 urgent primary care provision easier for patients to access.
The additional access will revolve around neighbourhood hubs and "clusters" where weekend and evening appointments will be available.
The board said it hopes the plans will reduce pressure on hospital A&E units.
The investment will also provide patients access to a range of other health and social care services such as diagnostics, blood tests and X-rays as well as supporting nursing and residential homes.
Partnership chairman Lord Peter Smith said: "This ¬£41m investment will ensure that our GPs across Greater Manchester are supported to provide high quality care now and in the future.
"Putting primary care back at the heart of our local communities is absolutely the right thing to do and shows how devolution can make gains for patients' right across Greater Manchester."
The plans do not mean that every GP practice in the region will have extra opening hours.
Instead it is envisaged patients having enhanced access at the neighbourhood level through "clusters" of practices working together, supported by a designated hub serving around 50,000 patients.
Dr David Wrigley, a Lancashire GP and BMA Council Deputy Chair, said: "It is good to hear about some new investment into general practice but I am concerned seven-day routine working is being rolled out when GPs struggle to provide a good five-day service, Monday to Friday, due to the years of under investment.
"We are short of thousands of GPs across the country and this new seven-day plan will seek to stretch my colleagues even more thinly across the week."
The board, which took control of the region's ¬£6bn health and social care budget in 2016, was told 2,500 patients who could be treated elsewhere are dealt with every day in A&E units across the region.
The plan will build on some schemes already in operation in Greater Manchester, such as in Bury.
Bury has had full extended GP access in place since January 2015 with weekday appointments available up to 20:00, and from 08:00 to 18:00 at weekends, delivered from three hub sites.
Surgeries in England are currently expected to open between 08:00 and 18:30 on weekdays with extra funding available to those offering slots outside those hours.
But the government wants GPs to stay open longer unless they can prove the demand is not there.
Greater Manchester's primary care reform plans were approved at a meeting in Wigan.

article In Taksim Square, where the heart of this city beats, there is a group of people wrapped up in Turkish flags, shouting "God is great!" in protest at the coup attempt and in support of the government.
This place would normally be packed with tourists, street musicians and people out shopping or having a drink in one of many bars. Now it feels edgy, angry and sad.
"What is happening to our country?" asks an old man. "Brothers are up in arms against each other," meaning the clashes between the coup-plotting soldiers and the security forces loyal to President Erdogan's government.
"I fear there will be more bloodshed. Do you think we will be like Syria?" he asks.
It has been an overwhelming night and day for millions of Turks, glued to their television screens and Twitter feeds, trying to figure out what was happening.
First, the pictures from Istanbul emerged, showing the major bridge over the Bosphorus seized by soldiers. People started to ask: Could this be a coup attempt?
As panic struck, the unease started spreading from adults to children. I was then still in Izmir, the third biggest city in Turkey, trying desperately to make my way to Istanbul.
The 11-year-old son of a friend travelling with me was in shock, crying, not knowing exactly what was happening and asking his father whether Turkey was at war now. His father tried to console him: "Everything will be OK."
Soon after the prime minister confirmed that this was indeed a coup attempt, carried out by a faction within the army, I saw people queuing in front of bakeries to buy bread, at petrol stations to buy fuel, at ATMs to withdraw as much money as they could.
It felt surreal - even for a country that has witnessed three coups and two further military interventions in the past.
Live pictures from Istanbul showed a local news channel's premises being raided when it was still on air. Soldiers were not seen on camera, but scuffles were heard. And gunfire.
People were constantly tweeting about the explosions: Was that a sound bomb or a major attack nearby, they were asking.
In the capital city Ankara, scenes were even more dramatic. Gunfire on the streets, tanks on the march, jets flying low over government buildings, helicopters hovering over the parliament.
At one point during the night, millions of Turkish citizens watched their parliament come under fire by helicopter attack live on television. The MPs shared their latest whereabouts on Twitter - taking refuge, packed in the shelters.
Never in Turkey's modern history had parliament been hit - even at the most turbulent times. It was a significant moment, symbolising the wound opened in the heart of Turkish democracy.
Almost everything was live on air. President Erdogan's in-vision call to a news channel was one of the iconic moments, when he called on everyone to take to the streets. Many imams repeated his call from mosques via megaphones. "We call on all to go out to public squares," they said.
And crowds answered the call. Soon there emerged pictures of men on top of tanks, beaten-up soldiers, jubilant anti-coup protestors. Dozens of rebels abandoned their positions.
The government says the coup attempt is over, blaming the movement supporting US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. They deny any sort of involvement.
But after at least 265 dead, 1,440 wounded, nearly 3,000 soldiers arrested, and more than 2,700 judges dismissed, many Turks wonder: how will Turkey cope with the trauma it just went through?

"The team demonstrated a thorough understanding and imagination for what we would like to achieve for Edinburgh St James which was reflected in their proposals.
"The final hotel design is likely to be influenced by the operator and given Edinburgh is continuing to prove a highly attractive destination with a growing tourist economy and strong finance market, we are encouraged by the response we have received from interested parties so far."

Exemptions for the 2016 Evian Championship and next year's ANA Inspiration, Women's PGA Championship, US Women's Open and Women's Open will be given to the winning woman.
Golf is returning to the Olympics in August for the first time in 112 years.
Masters chairman Billy Payne told a news conference at Augusta National: "We believe our game's visibility will be dramatically elevated by the global platform that only the Olympics offer.
"From this greater visibility, we believe will evolve greater participation in our game, and it will be a certain beneficiary."
While some of the world's top players would already hold exemptions to the majors, Pete Bevacqua, the chief executive officer of the PGA of America, said: "From our perspective, whether it's someone that is in the top rankings of the world or someone who is that Cinderella story, in both ways it's a positive."
Exemptions for major tournaments can be achieved in a variety of ways, such as being a previous winner, while world rankings can also play a part.

To work out what's really happening, researchers are starting a massive count at one of Britain's most important homes to seabirds - Bempton Cliffs in East Yorkshire.
Bempton Cliffs is the biggest mainland colony for birds in England. Around 200,000 seabirds flock there, but the experts are seeing a decline in numbers of several species including the puffin.

article Flowers, 63, was arrested last November after newspaper allegations he had been involved in a drug deal.
The suspended Methodist minister had stepped down from the Co-op six months earlier over concerns about expenses.
He was fined ¬£400 and ordered to pay ¬£125 in costs after pleading guilty to charges of possessing cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine.
He had earlier apologised for "stupid and wrong" behaviour, saying he had been under pressure because of problems at the bank and the recent death of his mother.
During the 10-minute hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors said Flowers had been filmed handing over ¬£300 for drugs in a car in Leeds last November.
The footage was subsequently sold to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, the judge was told.
Flowers admitted the offence to police and said he had taken cocaine for about 18 months to "keep himself going" while he was suffering stress and caring for his then terminally ill mother.
Flowers' barrister, Richard Wright QC, said his client had a current income of ¬£510 a month from pensions and unspecified assets inherited from his mother.
Outside court, Flowers said only: "Don't ask me any questions because I won't give any answers."
His appearance in court came on the day a review of the Co-op Group by former board member Lord Myners said the organisation should adopt a much smaller board and focus on being profitable in order to survive.
Lord Myners said the group's current board was "manifestly dysfunctional" and needed more members with business experience.
Flowers, who oversaw the near-collapse of the group's banking arm, previously served as a Labour councillor in Bradford and on an informal board advising Labour leader Ed Miliband on banking.
He was suspended by the Labour Party and the Methodist Church following the drug allegations and faces a disciplinary procedure by the Church.
His appointment as Co-op Bank chairman in April 2010 was widely criticised because of his inexperience in banking.
In May last year, the Co-op Bank was found to have a ¬£1.5bn black hole in its finances.
Flowers stepped down the following month.
In November, Flowers was called to appear before Parliament's Treasury Select Committee to discuss his management of the bank.
After his appearance, the committee's chairman Andrew Tyrie said Flowers was "manifestly unsuitable" to be chairman of a bank.
The bank has since agreed a refinancing deal which saw the Co-op Group's stake fall to 30%.
US institutions now hold the other 70%.
Flowers is also a former trustee of the drugs charity Lifeline, from which he resigned in 2004 after allegedly filing false expenses claims.

article He is passionate about a species of which its mere existence is hotly debated: Wild big cats in the UK.
"I know they are out there," said Mr Tunbridge, who has spent nearly 25 years investigating Gloucestershire's reported big cats.
He said that on average he received two sightings a week from across the county.
His passion is equalled by that of Rick Minter, 50, who has written a book about big cats in the wilds of Britain.
"The main candidates for the larger types of feral big cats being reported in Britain are puma-type cats and panthers," he said.
"A puma is a sandy-grey coloured cat, also known as cougar and mountain lion. A black panther is biologically a leopard or a jaguar in its black form."
Mr Minter admitted some people just found the idea of big cats roaming wild in the English countryside too incredible to believe.
"You do feel largely like you are beavering away in your own little world," he said.
"Then, suddenly January 2012 comes along and half the nation's media are tracking your every step.
"You're suddenly engulfed with emails and reporters and programmes wanting to know about the latest deer carcass or your view on 'X' in relation to big cats."
The incident he refers to came about when the National Trust announced that it had called for DNA tests to be carried out on a deer carcass found on its land near Stroud, Gloucestershire.
A trust spokesman had initially said the deer's injuries - and way the carcass had been eaten by its killer - were thought to be "highly indicative of big cat activity".
But three weeks later the results are back and they are negative to the idea of a big cat predator. Fox and deer DNA are the only traces found on the swabs taken.
But Mr Tunbridge said he still believed the big cats were out there - and said he had his own close encounter to prove it.
"It was dead quiet," he said, remembering a night he spent tracking wildlife near Minchampton, Stroud, last September.
"You could hear a pin drop, and this big cat growled behind me - just warning me.
"Through my night vision equipment I just saw it swoop down, sweep up a rabbit and disappear into a small wood.
"They are so elusive, so stealthy - especially leopards and pumas - they see you before you see them."
Mr Minter, meanwhile, said he had seen three big cats in the wild - a black panther in Cumbria, a puma-like cat in a Cotswold woodland and a smaller cat, "like a jungle cat", near the River Severn in Gloucester.
Between June 2007 and April 2011, Gloucestershire Police took 38 calls about big cat sightings.
According to the force's records, most of the animals were described as large black cats although there was one reported sighting of a lion.
So, why would big cats be found in the far-from-tropical conditions of the Cotswolds?
Both of the big cat hunters said they believed the most likely explanation is that such animals have been released from domestic situations and small private collections.
Following the introduction of the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act, more costly and rigorous conditions were applied for keeping such animals.
Natural England, the government's advisory body on the natural environment, has stated it is confident there is no breeding big cat population in this country.
A spokesman said reports were occasionally received, but no sightings had ever been confirmed and the evidence it had looked at had either been unsubstantiated or attributed to other causes.
But this is not the line taken by those who are convinced they have seen, heard or tracked a big cat in the wild.
As for DNA testing of animal carcasses, previous cases have shown up different results, Mr Minter said.
He claimed that in 2003, tests on a black animal hair found after a sighting in Lincolnshire gave positive results for a leopard.
Two years later, DNA results consistent with a puma were found on a hair recovered after sightings in Neath, South Wales.
And in 2009 the  
          Forestry Commission confirmed
 that rangers had twice spotted big cats while conducting deer surveys in the Forest of Dean.
"Recent community surveys have indicated a strong desire for big cat evidence to be researched as robustly as possible, and for all aspects of this subject to be considered in a responsible way," added Mr Minter.
"We are coming to a time when we must learn about them."

article The US economy added 235,000 new jobs in February, Mr Trump's first full month in office.
He retweeted a news report with the caption: "GREAT AGAIN".
During a campaign speech last August, Mr Trump called the Department of Labor numbers one of the "biggest hoaxes in American modern politics".
Challenged about this contradiction at Friday's daily news briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Mr Trump believes, "they may have been phony in the past but it's very real now."
The latest figures brought down the US unemployment rate from 4.8% to 4.7%, the report found.
Much of the growth is being attributed by analysts to an unusually clement few weeks, allowing construction projects and hiring to continue uninterrupted.
Last month was the warmest February on record.
Two years ago in a press conference, Mr Trump attacked the official unemployment rate, calling it "such a phony number" and "the biggest joke".
He asserted that some "great economists" estimate the real US jobless rate is as high as 32% or 42%.
PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, rated this claim as "pants on fire" false.
Mr Trump's US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during his confirmation hearing that "the unemployment rate is not real".

article Her call came the day after it was announced Scotland would face a ¬£176.8m cut in public spending this year.
Chancellor George Osborne announced a ¬£3bn cut in UK departmental budgets for 2015/16 and the knock-on for Scotland.
In a letter to the four opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon said the parties "must speak with a united voice".
The letter was sent to Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Scottish Green Patrick Harvie.
It said: "I hope that you will agree with me that all parties in Scotland must unite in making clear to the UK government that it is unacceptable for reductions to be imposed on this year's Scottish Budget.
"Not only do such reductions have a potentially damaging impact on our programmes and public services, but the chancellor's approach shows little respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament itself in approving the annual devolved Scottish Budget."
Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to argue for an alternative to the UK government's austerity programme.
This would involve a "moderate increase" in public spending of 0.5% a year in real terms between 2016-17 and 2019-20, she said.
Mr Osborne made his cuts announcement ahead of his emergency budget, which will take place on 8 July.
The Tory chancellor said he believed it was vital to tackle UK debt "as quickly as possible".
The UK government has pledged to clear the deficit by 2018/19.
Mr Osborne must find a further ¬£30bn of savings over the next three years, including ¬£12bn from welfare spending and ¬£13bn from government departments.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: "Nicola Sturgeon doesn't seem to understand that if Britain is going to prosper for the long-term, it needs to pay its way in the world and no longer pass on multi-billion pound deficits for our children and grand-children to pay off."
He added: "The truth is that the time when the SNP could resort to its age-old tactic of whipping up grievance over UK government decisions is over.
"Tax-raising powers are coming to the Scottish Parliament, so if it wants to act, it can."
Mr Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said he opposed the UK government cuts but "the Tories are unlikely to listen".
He said: "The real challenge will be to achieve unity in the Scottish Parliament to use our own devolved power to achieve fairer taxation and protection of the public services we all depend on."

article Mr Mladic faces 11 charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity, dating to the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
He is specifically accused of a hand in the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys at Srebrenica - Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
Mr Mladic denies all charges and has denounced the UN tribunal as "satanic".
At the session on Tuesday, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that there were still good grounds to try Mr Mladic on two counts of genocide.
The charges relate to the killings at Srebrenica, and to the expulsion of the Muslim Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serb populations in a wartime campaign that came to be known as "ethnic cleansing".
Lawyers for Mr Mladic had argued that there was not enough evidence linking him to the most serious of the crimes.
However, Judge Alphons Orie said "that the accused has a case to answer on all counts", citing material presented by prosecutors, including video footage of Mr Mladic calling on revenge against the Muslims of Srebrenica.
Mr Mladic is also charged in connection with the 44-month siege of Sarajevo during which more than 10,000 people died.

article Carwyn Jones thinks the lesson is that the party must show it is distinctly Welsh.
Voters aren't interested if they suspect someone in London is pulling the strings, he says.
"We suffered in 1999 because we were seen as a party being controlled by London and we have to accept that. That's not the case any more."
Between now and polling day on May 5 he'll be doing his best to convince you that Labour has learned that lesson over the last 17 years.
Labour wants its campaign to have a distinctly Welsh flavour. That's why its Welsh leader will be front and centre throughout.
He wants another five years in power to complete a "decade of delivery" that started in 2011.
But opponents say he's had long enough to deliver. He's been first minister since 2009. Labour has led the Welsh government since 1999.
On a campaigning visit to a day care nursery in Cardiff, he brushes aside that criticism.
"I think we've delivered a huge amount for people," he says.
He cites "ground breaking laws" on organ donation and Aston Martin's recently announced plans to build luxury cars in south Wales.
Were it not for devolution, "we would have a junior doctors' strike".
But the opposition parties see it differently. Were it not for Welsh Labour's devolved government, we'd have shorter waiting times in the NHS, according to the Conservatives.
Labour's record in the health service will be the big battle ground in the election - an election Mr Jones says is "a straight fight" with the Tories.
He says UKIP pose a threat to Labour too, but in our interview - as in his Welsh Labour conference speech last month - he doesn't mention Plaid Cymru at all.
It's a reflection of Labour's strategy to convince voters this is an either/or election: either keep Carwyn Jones as first minister, or hand over the reins to Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader.
But could that strategy be undone by the spectacle of Labour MPs feuding with each other in Westminster since Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader after last year's general election defeat?
"What we've seen in London hasn't helped. Nobody could pretend otherwise," he says.
"It's calmer there now but people don't like parties which are fighting with each other."
He adds: "What we've said to people is as Welsh Labour we're united. We've got a programme going into the election. I'm the leader.
"And the policies that we will develop in Wales, the policies we will put in our manifesto, are all crafted in Wales.
There's no influence over those policies in terms of our colleagues in London. They wouldn't seek to influence our policies anyway."
Mr Jones likes to call his Welsh government a "pro-business government".
I ask him whether that's his coded way of distancing his administration in Cardiff from the left-wing politics of Mr Corbyn and his supporters.
"No. This is my way of differentiating Welsh Labour as a party. I would do this regardless of what the situation was in London," he says.
"We've done it in elections past. People in Wales want to support parties that they feel have a degree of autonomy, enough of a degree of autonomy, that makes them a properly Welsh party with roots in Wales."
He denies that his "decade of delivery" is a hint that, if he wins, he's planning to stand down at 2021 election.
He and wife Lisa have a son Ruairi and daughter Seren, both of whom are at school. Does he ever wonder about life away politics - a life where he could spend more time with them?
"The honest answer is yes, it has been difficult for the family. My children have only know me as a minister and you do make sacrifices in this job.
"When I get spare time I do spend time with the family. It means you've not got much time for anything else."
But he adds: "I love the job. It's for other people to decide whether I stay in it obviously. You couldn't do this job if you didn't like it."
Those other people - the voters - will make their decision on May 5.

article New figures show there were 14,670 households accepted as homeless between July and September, the largest number since 2008.
According to Shelter, more than 103,000 children will spend Christmas in B&Bs, hostels or temporary rented homes.
Ministers said the figures were still half the 2003 and 2004 peak.
Department for Communities and Local Government statistics show there were 68,560 families in temporary housing from July to September this year, compared with 60,900 in the same three months of 2014.
And 53,480 of those were households with children, compared with 45,590 at the same time the year before.
Shelter said a quarter of all homeless households living in temporary accommodation in England had been moved away to another council area.
The figures showed 18,600 homeless households moved to another area, more than three times as many as in 2010.
Families in temporary accommodation outside their local areas are under particular strain, according to Shelter.
They are "uprooted and moved away from jobs, schools and support networks with no idea when, or even if, they will be able to return", says chief executive Campbell Robb.
But four in ten homeless households in temporary accommodation find themselves in this position, the latest figures show.
This is more than three times the figure for the same period in 2010 when 5,880 households were in temporary accommodation in another local authority area.
Families in bed and breakfast hotels who have to share kitchens and bathrooms often rely on kitchen facilities of relatives or friends to cook healthy food, a Shelter researcher explained.
One woman, offered temporary accommodation in a city hundreds of miles from home, turned it down as she would have lost her job and her children would have been forced to change schools.
Frequent changes of school and long journeys can be very disrupting for children, the researcher added.
Councils are finding it far harder to find homeless households local accommodation due to "a severe drought of affordable homes and drastic cuts to council budgets", Mr Robb added.
The problem is particularly acute in London where one in three families in temporary accommodation are outside their original areas.
Communities Minister Marcus Jones said: "We are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in our society. The protection of the Homelessness Prevention Grant in the Local Government Finance Settlement shows our continued commitment to tackling homelessness.
"Statutory homelessness acceptances are now less than half the 2003 to 2004 peak but we are determined to ensure that anybody who needs help gets it.
"We have made over ¬£500m available since 2010, which has prevented nearly a million people becoming homeless. We are committed to build on this over the next four years and work with the sector to do all we can to prevent homelessness."
New measures include protecting homelessness prevention for local authorities and ¬£40m from the Department of Health to refurbish hostels and provide low cost shared accommodation for young people. There will also be ¬£30m extra for councils' homelessness budgets and a ¬£5m fund for the 25 local authorities facing the greatest pressures moving people from temporary to settled homes.
The councils sharing the funding are: Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Birmingham, Brent, Bromley, Brighton and Hove, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Hounslow , Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Lewisham, Luton, Newham, Redbridge, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster
Shelter said the figures meant 109,000 children in England, Scotland and Wales would be in a hostel or temporary accommodation on 25 December, 103,430 of them in England.
Chief executive of Shelter, Campbell Robb, said:  "These figures are a heart-breaking reminder that thousands of families will wake up homeless this Christmas morning - many hidden away in a cramped and dingy B&B or hostel room, sometimes miles away from everyone and everything they know.
"With the double blow of cuts to welfare and a chronic lack of affordable housing, many more families are facing a desperate battle to keep a roof over their heads.
"Our advisors will be working non-stop to support the 109,000 children who'll be homeless this Christmas, but we're struggling to keep up with demand. That's why we urgently need more support from the public to help us make sure that no-one is left to fight bad housing or homelessness on their own."
A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils finding it difficult to house homeless people because of a shortage of affordable homes and funding pressures.
He added: "It is important that councils have the funding and flexibilities to help those who find themselves homeless or at risk of homelessness. Local authorities also need the power to invest in building more homes that local communities can genuinely afford."
A person is considered "statutorily homeless" by the government if they no longer have a legal right to occupy their accommodation or if it would no longer be reasonable to live there, for example if it would lead to violence against them.
Other reasons included no longer being able to stay with family or friends, relationship breakdown and mortgage arrears leading to repossession.

article Eric Laurent and Catherine Graciet, who are writing a book on King Mohammed VI, were reportedly detained after being handed cash by a Moroccan official.
A lawyer for the Moroccan government told France's RTL radio that Mr Laurent contacted the royal palace in July to demand √¢‚Äö¬¨3 million (√Ç¬£2.2m; $3.4m).
Mr Laurent allegedly warned the palace about damaging revelations in the book.
"A sum of money was handed over and accepted" at a meeting between the journalist and a Moroccan government official, according to France's AFP news agency.
The publishing company Editions du Seuil confirmed that the pair, who have already written one book about the Moroccan monarch, were working on a second volume due for publication early next year.
Moroccan website Le360.ma, which has close ties to the palace, reported details of how Moroccan representatives held two meetings with Mr Laurent that were monitored by police.
The journalists were then arrested after leaving a restaurant with an alleged down payment, the report said.
Mr Laurent and Ms Graciet's 2012 book, Predator King, was critical of Mohammed VI, detailing how his fortune had ballooned since taking the throne in 1999.
Moroccan law prohibits criticising the king, with a possible penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone who does so.
summary Two British authors who have been arrested in Morocco have been released by the Moroccan government.

article Graciam Kondowe was among 54 passengers who police say survived after the boat overturned in stormy weather on Sunday.
Five people drowned while 11 are still missing, police said.
The boat was packed with worshippers returning from Easter celebrations when it capsized in the remote Rumphi district in northern Malawi.
Mr Kondowe told Malawi's privately owned Zodiac radio station that heavy winds buffeted the boat about 15 minutes into their journey.
The crew decided to return to shore, but the boat capsized before they could get back, he added.
Mr Kondowe said he held on to a bag of maize flour which fell out of the boat, and eventually swam his way to safety.
Eight of the 54 survivors are being treated in hospital after sustaining injuries, police officer Denis Banda said.
Locals residents used canoes to rescue most of the passengers, Malawian journalist Joab Chakhaza told the BBC.
Search operations are continuing for the 11 people still missing, but the chances of finding them alive are slim, he adds.
Boats are a common mode of transport on the vast Lake Malawi, and accidents of this magnitude are rare.
In 2012, 47 migrants fleeing drought and conflict in Somalia and Ethiopia drowned in the lake after their boat capsized.

article Zhang Chunxian vowed to use "iron fists" on separatists in the region, Xinhua news agency says.
The warning comes on the anniversary of deadly ethnic riots that saw almost 200 people killed in 2009.
Rights group Amnesty International has accused China of intimidating the ethnic Uighur minority.
Xinjiang province is the country's most westerly region and borders former Soviet states.
China witnessed its worst ethnic violence in decades when riots erupted between the majority Han Chinese and the minority Uighurs in the capital city of Urumqi, says the BBC's Martin Patience.
The Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have lived in China's shadow for centuries, accuse Beijing of religious and political persecution.
Mr Zhang, who is Communist Party secretary of the Xinjiang committee, urged soldiers to remain vigilant against hostile forces and strike separatists, terrorists and extremists with ''iron fists'', Xinhua says.
"We should leave terrorists no place to hide," he said, adding that the region was stable but faced "severe challenges".
London-based rights group Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement saying that Chinese authorities "continue to silence those speaking out on abuses" in the region.
"The general trend toward repression that we see all over China is particularly pronounced in Xinjiang," Catherine Baber, AI Asia-Pacific director,  
          said in a statement
.
She urged the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts of those who have disappeared and end the persecution of family members seeking answers.
On Monday, there were reports that two Uighur men who allegedly tried to hijack a plane in Xinjiang had died.

Stokes was hit for four consecutive sixes in the last over by Carlos Brathwaite as the West Indies beat England in a dramatic final on Sunday.
"He is an outstanding talent and an outstanding cricketer," said Cook.
"He is the type of character who will deal with it, and he will still be the Ben Stokes who can score 250 in a Test match," added the 31-year-old opener.
"It was outstanding hitting. 'Stokesy' would certainly have his first ball again but the second one wasn't too far off the mark and it went 94 metres back."
Cook admitted he was devastated by England's defeat, telling BBC Essex: "I don't normally get too emotional watching a game of cricket.
"It was a brilliant tournament for everyone, it's just a shame that last over didn't quite go to plan."
Cook's county, Essex, begin a new era under newly-appointed coach Chris Silverwood on Sunday against Gloucestershire.
The left-hander, England's leading run-scorer in Test cricket, is available to play in the Division Two opener at Chelmsford.
"In any elite sport you do need freshening up at certain times," Cook said. "I think it was fairly obvious after seven or eight years it was time for a change.
"We've been the nearly men for the last four or five years. We've been close to promotion a number of times.

article The report from David Strang, chief inspector of prisons for Scotland, made 41 recommendations to improve performance at the jail.
However he said the report was "good" overall, with positive points raised about food, visiting arrangements and staff-prisoner relationships.
The jail was inspected in December.
The prison, Scotland's oldest, was built in 1810 by Napoleonic prisoners of war and has an agreed capacity of 631. At the time of inspection, there were a total of 626 prisoners held there.
The jail has previously been criticised for overcrowding.
Mr Strang said the standard of accommodation at the prison was "reasonable", but noted: "Some cells are designed as single cell accommodation were regularly occupied by two people, and were extremely cramped with insufficient room to move around in."
He also reported that while prisoners have "good access to a varied regime" including work, education and recreation, "work party spaces are insufficient, which results in some prisoners spending longer periods of time within their cells".
Between 1 January and 30 November there were 94 recorded violent incidents in the prison, including nine attacks on staff, 48 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, and 37 fights between prisoners. The prison authorities responded to this by introducing a revised violence reduction strategy.
Mr Strang concluded that "overall this is a good report for HMP Perth", and said the inspectorate would continue to monitor progress made in relation to the 41 recommendations.

article Apple won a ban on the devices, claiming Samsung had copied its iPhone and iPad.
South Korean Samsung had been unable to sell products in Australia since July.
The two companies are engaged in legal battles in more than 10 countries since April accusing each other of infringing smartphone and tablet patents.
Last month, Samsung won an appeal against a temporary ban on sales.
However, Apple was awarded a stay of the orders. On Friday Apple's bid to extend the ban was turned down by the High Court.
The ruling is a rare win for Samsung as it allows the company to sell its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in time for the busy Christmas shopping season, a lucrative time for the industry.
The decision comes after a US court ruled against Apple's bid to ban Galaxy phones and tablets, another win for Samsung. Apple has appealed against that ruling.
However, the legal tussle in other markets is not going as well for Samsung.
The company said on Friday that a French court had turned down its request to ban sale of the latest iPhone in that country.
summary Samsung and Apple have reached a settlement with the Australian government over the iPhone and iPad.

article The principality's vast harbour is littered with huge yachts belonging to those rich people who are not only proud of the trappings of their station in life, but are always looking for different ways to display it.
One story I heard was of a super yacht owner who had just found a new use for his vessel - the school run.
But for some, a mega yacht on its own is no longer enough - you need the latest accessories too. Amongst the newest of these is a machine whose time, advocates say, has come - the "personal" submarine.
Several of the latest models were on display in Monaco, including some from a small US company - DeepFlight.
It was founded by the British engineer, inventor and entrepreneur Graham Hawkes, who has had an extraordinary career.
For many years he held a world record for solo depth diving; he's invented a robotic machine-gun; and he's played the part of a villain in a James Bond film. He designed and operated a small sub used in an underwater battle in the movie, For Your Eyes Only.
BBC presenter Peter Day and I first met Mr Hawkes in California several years ago. At the time he was obsessed with the idea of building a craft capable of going right to the bottom of the ocean.
Beaten to it by film director James Cameron, who accomplished the feat in 2012, he steered his business in a new direction.
Now, his company makes a range of submersible craft aimed at the super yacht crowd, marine researchers, and others.
One of the selling points of machines like these, says Mr Hawkes, is that they enable astonishing experiences.
Once, when he was taking the entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson on an underwater trip, they had a memorable encounter with a great white shark, which swam past them.
"It was bigger than this submersible", he recalls. "I was looking straight in to this eye of this huge predator and I was just in awe. And Richard was saying 'Graham, get closer, get closer'.
"And all I remember saying is 'Richard, I'm not going to lunge at a great white shark'. But we ended up laughing and giggling after that, we were so happy."
The devices made by DeepFlight differ from some other small subs because they are "positively buoyant," and need force or motion to keep them underwater.
If thrust disappears for any reason, the craft will float back to the surface - a feature which Mr Hawkes claims offers safety benefits.
The Super Falcon model works in a similar way to an aircraft, he explains: "It has 'wings' and you need to get some speed, about a walking speed on the surface, and then you point it down and the wings pull it down‚Ä¶ and it flies under water. "
Another model, the Dragon, works more like a helicopter, and can "hover" underwater.
Small submarines have been around for many years but it is only comparatively recently that the market for them has begun to take off.
"My partner and I were at yacht shows twenty years ago with manned submersibles and bigger diesel electric luxury submarines," recalls another Monaco exhibitor, L. Bruce Jones of Florida-based Triton Submarines.
"And people would walk by our booth and sort of snicker at us - what are those crazy guys doing here?
"But now, fast forward twenty years and we're being accepted."
One reason for this change lies in recent advances in technology, which have helped to lower manufacturing costs, and also enabled the production of more versatile craft, with many additional features.
Triton's range includes battery-powered subs that can dive down to depths of hundreds of metres for many hours before needing to return to the surface.
Another development, that is proving popular with customers, is the huge increase in the size of windows.
"In the old days you used to have this big steel pressure hull with small windows," says Erik Hasselman of Dutch sub makers U-Boat Worx, which is also exhibiting its products at the Monaco show.
Mr Hasselman says that recent improvements in acrylic technology mean that "we can build these very large acrylic spheres that will allow people to have a really big window," and thus get a much better view of what is happening beneath the waves.
None of this comes cheap. Prices for the smallest personal submersible craft start at around $1.5m (¬£1m). The high cost is likely to ensure that these products remain the preserve of the wealthy, commercial users, and well-funded research bodies.
However sub-makers also see the possibility of substantial growth in the leisure market, in which operators are already offering tourists underwater trips in small submarines.
If that happens, then increasing attention may start to be focused on the health of the world's oceans - something that many scientists are deeply concerned about.
At the moment, says Mr Hawkes, this issue can seem remote to many people.
But, he asks, "what if the politician ‚Ä¶what if the fisherman, what if the housewife who was worried about the damage to the ocean could have gone and seen? ‚Ä¶ The important thing is that, [today] nobody can go, nobody can see.
"We're trying to change that."

Robinson, 48, was first-team coach at Sussex and scheduled to start his new role at the end of the year, in time for the South Africa tour in February.
"To have the chance to play a part in the next chapter for the England women's team is a great honour," the former right-arm seam bowler said.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had wanted someone with "first-class or international playing or coaching experience" as the women's set-up underwent a restructure.
"He has a superb coaching record with Sussex, experience of working with England teams, a reputation for getting the best out of players, and is highly regarded as one of the best coaches working in the men's professional game," ECB head of women's cricket Clare Connor said.
"The next 18 months are hugely important for the England women's team and the players must quickly get back to winning ways in South Africa."
England, who lost this summer's multi-format Ashes series to Australia, are second in the International Cricket Council's women's team rankings.
Sussex have appointed Mark Davis, 44, as Robinson's successor.
"Robinson has pedigree and is a well-respected coach within the English game, having won two County Championships at Sussex - but they were relegated last season," BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said.
"He has no international experience - that was something Clare Connor said was a key attribute for any successful candidate.
"But Robinson led an England Lions tour to South Africa at the start of 2015, apparently impressing the ECB during the trip.
"This is a step up for the England women with a coach with vast experience at a high level in the men's game, but the pressure is on with success expected at next year's World Twenty20."
summary England women's women's team have appointed James Robinson as their new head coach.

article They took the lead when Algeria's Aissa Mandi directed Youssef Msakni's left-wing cross into his own net.
And some dreadful defending by Faouzi Ghoulam led to him bringing down Wahbi Khazri for a penalty which Naim Sliti coolly slotted into the right corner.
Algeria pulled a goal back when Sofiane Hanni struck from the edge of the area.
Tunisia's victory takes them to three points and second place in Group B and leaves Algeria with only one point.
Group leaders Senegal can qualify later on Thursday by beating Zimbabwe.
It means Algeria, who had been one of the pre-tournament favourites, will have to rely on other results going their way if they are to qualify from the group - and they have to face Senegal in their final match.
Tunisia went into the game off the back of a 2-0 defeat to Senegal and anything other than victory against Algeria would have left them in serious trouble.
They were fortunate with their first goal, the ball looping off Mandi's foot to deceive Algerian goalkeeper Malik Asselah, who was playing in place of injured first-choice stopper Rais M'bolhi.
And they were gifted their second when Algeria defender Ghoulam sent an underpowered header back towards his goal and then fouled Khazri who had nipped ahead of him to collect the ball  and bear down on goal. Sliti confidently struck home the spot-kick.
Algeria started the match well and Islam Slimani's point-blank header brought an excellent save from Aymen Mathlouthi, while Riyad Mahrez should have done better with a shot from the edge of the area.
Much of Tunisia's best work involved Kazri - starting for the first time at the tournament - and the Sunderland midfielder tested Asselah early on with a free-kick.
Algeria struggled to rouse themselves after going behind and although substitute Hanni took his chance well, sending a curling shot into the corner, their largely toothless display has left them on the verge of an early exit.

article Fusilier Dean Griffiths, 21, of First Battalion the Royal Welsh, died at Lydd Range, Kent in September 2011.
An inquest in 2013 heard a target was wrongly placed against a wall but there was no evidence it was malicious.
A Crown Censure is the maximum sanction the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) can impose on a government body.
The MoD cannot be prosecuted in the same way as non-government bodies.
Fusilier Griffiths, from Market Drayton, Shropshire, whose partner was pregnant at the time of his death, was serving with the Chester-based battalion as it prepared to go to Afghanistan.
He died during a simulated combat exercise in a compound built to replicate an Afghan building.
The HSE said Fusilier Griffiths was part of an assault group assigned to enter and secure the compound.
The compound contained both enemy and civilian targets made from thin plywood to allow the live bullets to pass through and avoid ricochets.
The HSE said its investigation found unused targets were usually laid on the floor to give the appearance of debris, but on this occasion an unused target was left upright against a wall..
Fusilier Griffiths was behind that target when the wall was breached with a simulated explosion.
As a colleague entered he saw an enemy target and fired two shots, hitting Fusilier Griffiths with a bullet that passed through the incorrectly placed enemy target.
The soldier died at the scene.
HSE said its investigators found the exercise was undermanned.
It said the incident could have been prevented by not using targets as debris and with a final walk through by the Range Conducting Officer to ensure all targets corresponded to the planned exercise.
The MoD admitted breaching its duty under Section 2(1) and 2(2) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

article PC Dave Giboney said moments after Arlindo Furtado stabbed himself in the throat, a colleague discharged his Taser, which missed.
Mr Furtado was later struck twice by Taser shots at his Cardiff home.
The inquest has heard Mr Furtado died from his neck wound, and not as a result of being stunned.
PC Giboney told Aberdare Coroner's Court his colleague and Mr Furtado fell on to the landing floor. He then discharged his Taser, which hit Mr Furtado's left side.
"I feared for my colleague. He was resisting, I did not know what he was going to do. I wanted to protect my colleague and prevent Mr Furtado from harming himself further," the officer said.
Mr Furtado died in hospital after armed police were called to his house in Adeline Street, Splott, on 11 October 2014, resulting in a stand-off lasting several hours.
Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbeatter found evidence of two Taser marks but said they were not the cause of death.
"The wound to the neck is sufficient to cause death," he said.
The inquest heard the day before his death, Mr Furtado told his partner Nicole Varela he would rather die than be without her and his children.
Reading a statement from Ms Varela, the coroner said she had been the victim of a "violent incident at his hands" the day before.
She said Mr Furtado "could be aggressive from time to time" but was also an "excellent father".
The inquest was told Mr Furtado was due to be arrested following allegations of domestic violence.
Police negotiator Det Chf Insp Brian Herd said he felt Mr Furtado was determined to end his life and became increasingly agitated as the afternoon wore on.
Ms Valera disagreed with negotiators who would not allow her to speak to him on a telephone link and believed she could have changed his mind.
DCI Herd said introducing a third person into the situation was a risk he could not take.
On the day before he died, Mr Furtado kept calling Ms Varela "asking for forgiveness" and had logged onto Facebook to say goodbye to family and friends.
The inquest also heard Mr Furtado's ex-partner in Portugal had called police in Cardiff on the day of his death to express concerns about his welfare.
The hearing continues.

article The move was both defensive and ambitious, carrying strong elements of both opportunity and risk.
"Part of the motivation was to avert a humanitarian disaster," said a senior source in Irbil.
"Had we not filled the vacuum left by the Iraqi army's departure, everybody would have flooded into the Kurdistan region. We had half a million people banging on our doors.
"It's a lot simpler to send 100 peshmergas (Kurdish military forces) to hold the fort and keep security, so that people could stay put. Once our units went in, the displaced started going back."
But there's clearly more to it than that. The Kurdish media have been hailing the step as a historic reunification of Kurdish lands.
Kirkuk city, which has a mixed population of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, has long been a thorny issue in Iraqi politics.
Its special status as a disputed city was recognised in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi constitution, which called for the situation in the city to be "normalised" by:
But that has never happened, and Kirkuk, as well as other disputed areas along the Arab-Kurdish ethnic fault line, have been flashpoints for friction between Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops.
Now, the latter have melted away, leaving Kirkuk to fall into the hands of the Kurds like a ripe fruit.
With the rest of Iraq apparently disintegrating along sectarian lines, and the central government in Baghdad in disarray, it will clearly be a long time before an Iraqi authority can challenge the Kurds' absorption of what they have long seen as the rightful jewel in their crown.
The Kurdistan region has already angered Baghdad by going its own way and selling its oil and gas directly to and through its northern neighbour Turkey, with which the regional government (KRG) has developed a close partnership despite historic Turkish suspicions of Kurdish nationalism.
Now it seems likely that the acquisition of Kirkuk, both the city and the province with its rich oilfields, will boost the trend towards outright independence for the Kurdistan region.
"Absolutely, it brings independence a step closer," said a well-placed source.
"We have lost hope in the sanity of the people governing Iraq. We don't want to be part of the failure of something for which we're not responsible. Nobody gave more than us in the effort to keep Iraq together, but now we're giving up, there's no hope."
But the move is not without risks.
It brings Kurdish forces into direct proximity with the militants who have taken over in Mosul and other adjacent areas.
In recent years, Kirkuk has already seen many suicide and other bomb attacks attributed to Sunni radicals, which are very rare inside the KRG autonomous area itself.
If instability spreads, it could affect the current boom in investment and economic activity in Kurdistan, which has flourished while the rest of Iraq has largely stagnated and been mired in turmoil.
If the Sunni areas are starting to go their own way, much will depend on the composition of the dominant forces taking part in that process.
So far, the public face that has resonated around the world has been that of the ultra-radical al-Qaeda offshoot known as ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
But as with the anti-US insurgency from 2004 on, there are clearly other strands to the revolt, which explains the resonance it is having, and the speed of its movement through the mainly Sunni areas on which it is concentrating.
The Kurds have no sympathy for the ISIS radicals, but they are in touch with other elements, including tribal leaders and commanders of the Military Councils of Iraqi Revolutionaries (MCIR), which includes many experienced former Iraqi army officers.
The Kurds have been given assurances from the latter that they will not encroach on the borders of the KRG autonomous region, according to an MCIR spokesman.
The MCIR claims that overall, its fighters are the most significant element in the revolt, with tribal militants in second place, and ISIS only third despite the media attention they command.
When Sunni rebels took over the city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, in January, Prime Minister Nouri Maliki asked the Kurds to send peshmerga forces to help drive them out, sources say.
But the request was turned down. The Kurdish leadership's message to the MCIR conversely was that Irbil would not be against the Sunnis taking the road of establishing their own autonomous area, following the lead of Kurdistan itself.
That would clearly not apply if ISIS emerged as the dominant force in self-administering Sunni areas. Its philosophy and practices are so extreme that it has even been disavowed by its parent leadership, the international al-Qaeda movement headed by Osama Bin Laden's successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.
A future scenario where the Kurdish forces helped "moderate" elements such as the MCIR to oust ISIS is not hard to envisage.
Already there are signs of a potential conflict between strands of the rebel movement, although they are cooperating for the time being.
"There is no friction or clashes between us at the moment, but we plan to avoid them until we are settled and operations are finished, then we will kick them out of Mosul," said an MCIR source.
"We are warning their leaders that if they perpetrate any violations, they will become our first enemy, so they are behaving so far."
Politically, the clerical body which is the spiritual point of reference for mainstream militant Sunni groups, the Association of Muslim Clerics (AMC), has put out a statement which clearly takes issue with the radical declaration put out by the ISIS spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the day before.
He called for revenge and score-settling in Baghdad, and for the militants to march on the holy Shia city of Karbala to the south of the capital.
That would clearly be a recipe for sectarian carnage and civil war between Sunnis and Shias, something the AMC said is absolutely not on the agenda.
"Calls for the revolutionaries to head for Karbala, Najaf and elsewhere are rejected, unacceptable and irresponsible on the part of those issuing them," the AMC statement said.
"It would stir hostility to the revolution and make it fail, diverting its goal from helping the oppressed to stirring up sectarian conflict between the sons of our one people, quite apart from the fact that everybody knows that most of the Iraqi people in the south reject Maliki and his gang, and suffer his oppression like the rest of us."
The AMC insisted that forgiveness and tolerance should be the keynote in administering the "liberated" areas, and that nothing should be done to prejudice people's livelihoods or impose dress codes on them, even if they were not in line with strict Islamic precepts.
In another clear reference to ISIS, it said that no group should claim to represent the entire revolt and take strategic decisions without consultation.
It also called for the immediate release of the 49 Turkish nationals seized by ISIS from the consulate in Mosul, saying this risked alienating a powerful neighbour and provoking intervention.
But even the AMC embraced the goal of reaching Baghdad, "because the ruling regime is there, the source of oppression and crimes against the people, so there is no other way of lifting the yoke as long as the regime fails to look after others."
So the seeds of an incipient struggle within the rebel movement are clearly there, though the AMC stressed the need to avoid the kind of chaos and in-fighting afflicting opposition groups in the anti-government uprising in Syria.
Clearly, the current Sunni revolt has much more to it than the intrusion of foreign jihadist "terrorists", as Prime Minister Maliki has claimed.
The Americans and others are aware that the turmoil reflects Mr Maliki's failure to draw major Sunni political forces into the political process and give them a stake, one of several factors inhibiting them from producing a forceful and determined response to his appeals for help.
Despite their visible differences, the various elements in the Sunni revolt are agreed on the need to push towards Baghdad, a campaign that is likely to see movement from the western side - Anbar province - as well as from the north.
But as with the Kurds in the north, the course of events will depend a great deal on which strand predominates within the rebel movement.
If ISIS prevails, open-ended sectarian strife can be expected. But if the more moderate groups assert themselves, there may be room for compromise and accommodation.

article The Unite union said around 480 of its members will vote before 13 July on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action.
Unite said members had rejected proposed changes to the pension schemes operated by airport owners AGS, who say they are "committed" to further talks.
Staff involved include security, airfield operations and firefighters.
Unite regional officer Pat McIlvogue said: "Unite has continually tried to negotiate a remedy with AGS over the proposed pensions schemes changes that avoids the need for industrial action and disruption at the two airports.
"Unite put forward a proposal, which would save the company √Ç¬£3.5m-a-year, but despite our repeated attempts to reach an amicable solution our efforts have been met with intransigence.
"Unite has no option but to ballot members for industrial action to protect pension provisions that are deferred wages and to strongly oppose AGS's proposed imposition."
A spokesman for AGS Airports Limited said: "Discussions have been ongoing between the company and union representatives regarding changes to the existing final salary (defined benefit) pension scheme since October 2015.
"We remain committed to holding further discussions with union representatives in order to reach a solution that is acceptable to all parties."

article The brewery, which originally aimed to raise ¬£4m in six months, is now looking to raise a further ¬£250,000 from selling more shares to "fanvestors".
The new target is the maximum sum which can be raised through such a scheme.
Crowdfunding is a way of raising equity by asking a large number of people each for a small amount of money.
Overall, Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog has raised almost ¬£7m through investors buying shares in the business during three rounds of Equity for Punks.
The current round, which is due to be completed in January, has raised ¬£3.7m so far.
The brewer said the extra funds raised would further boost the expansion of its bar division as well as fund a new series of "bottle shops" across the UK designed to cater for a growing demand for craft beer.
The company, which now employs 200 staff, reported it was on track to achieve turnover of ¬£19m in 2013.
BrewDog co-founder James Watt said: "It has been an epic response to Equity for Punks this year, and we now have over 12,000 shareholders all over the world.
"It's this phenomenal response that has made it clear we are going to sell the full ¬£4m allocation of shares well before our January deadline, so we are pushing the limit even further.
"Through Equity for Punks we have shown that far from a buzzword or a fad, crowdfunding is a legitimate alternative financial system.
"We have broken all records, and silenced all doubters, and now we want to ensure all the fans that have supported us have a chance to buy a share of BrewDog."

He was arrested at 04:15 BST within a security perimeter. He did not gain access to the palace.
The Met said the suspected intruder had been drinking and that the incident was not thought to be terrorism related.
The force added the man was not armed and no Taser was deployed by officers.
He is currently being held in a central London police station.
No member of the royal family was in residence.
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson declined to comment.
There have been several breaches at the Palace, including in May when a 41-year-old man was arrested in the grounds after an alarm went off.
Last year two men got on to the roof of the Queen's Gallery, close to the palace, as part of a protest over fathers' rights while in 2013, a man scaled a fence and was arrested inside a room which was open to the public during the day.
A more notable breach was in 1982 when Michael Fagan got into the Queen's bedroom and spent 10 minutes talking to her before she managed to raise the alarm when he asked for a cigarette.

article The proposed "European Security Markets Authority" would initially regulate credit rating agencies, but could be given broader powers at a later date.
The agencies gave their highest "AAA" rating to billions of dollars of debts that went bad in the financial crisis.
Michel Barnier, the commissioner behind the proposal, has also advocated a single European banking regulator.
The internal market commissioner wants national regulators to transfer all their supervision powers over the rating agencies to the new authority.
"In contrast to banks and insurance companies, rating services are not linked to particular territories," the Commission said in a press release.
US inquiry grills ratings agency
"The changes to rules on credit rating agencies will mean better supervision and increased transparency in this crucial sector," said Mr Barnier.
"But they are only a first step," he added. "We are looking at this market in more detail."
The rating agencies have been accused on both sides of the Atlantic of being a major culprit in the financial crisis.
In the US, a Congressional inquiry committee was due on Wednesday to question senior managers at rating agency Moody's, as well as billionaire investor Warren Buffett, about the agencies' role in the crisis.
In Europe, Mr Barnier criticised the rating agencies in May for their rapid downgrade of Greece's debts to "junk" status.
"I think we need to go further to look at the impact of the ratings on the financial system or economic system as a whole," he said at the time.
"The power of these agencies is quite considerable not only for companies but also for states."
The rating agencies stand accused of a conflict of interests, as their fees were paid for by the banks whose deals they were rating.
Under Mr Barnier's proposal, banks would be forced to disclose full details on their financial transactions to all the rating agencies.
The Commission hopes that this will encourage other rating agencies to provide unsolicited - and more impartial - ratings for these deals.
However, it is unclear what financial incentive there would be for them to provide these competing ratings.
Separately, the Commission has also published a proposal paper on changing the way in which financial institutions such as banks are governed.
Directors and major shareholders in banks have been criticised for allowing the banks' management to take on too much risk prior to the financial crisis.
The proposals include:
The corporate governance "green paper" is only intended to stimulate discussion, and the Commission does not expect to propose any specific new legislation on until 2011.

article Brokers say that, in recent years, the best deals were only available to those offering a large deposit, but there were now signs of change.
However, a new record rate five-year mortgage, newly on sale, still requires a 40% deposit.
The HSBC mortgage, with a rate of 1.99%, also comes with a ??1,499 fee.
Earlier this month, lenders told the Bank of England that demand for new mortgages had fallen for a third successive quarter.
The bank's Credit Conditions Survey found that demand for mortgages for high-value property saw the biggest fall since the third quarter of 2008.
Having been concentrated on this market, there are now signals that banks and building societies are casting their net a little wider.
The survey found that lenders were showing a greater willingness to lend to borrowers who were only able to offer a deposit of less than 10% of the property's value so far this year.
"The lenders are stepping up the fight to attract new borrowers and rates are still getting cheaper," said Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.
"First-time buyers with a 5% deposit can take a fixed rate just over 4% and if they can raise a 10% deposit the rates are as low as 2.69%.
"A few years ago borrowers needed a 40% deposit to access a really good mortgage, but now rates are cheap for most new buyers.
"HSBC's latest fixed rate really takes the mortgage price war into new territory and even cheaper deals may well filter through to the market."
Nearly two-thirds of mortgage holders are sticking to a variable rate as the Bank of England's base rate is showing no signs of rising from its historic low of 0.5%.
Charlotte Nelson, of financial information service Moneyfacts, said that 15 lenders had cut mortgage rates in a week - partly to try to tempt some variable rate customers back to fixed rates.
"The competition to be the lowest in the mortgage market shows no signs of stopping and is great news for borrowers," she said.
All this appears to be good news for first-time buyers struggling to afford a property.
Yet, there are still significant hurdles for these, generally young, potential property owners.
The most eye-catching deals - such as HSBC's home loan which is said to be the first five-year mortgage with a rate of under 2% - can still come with significant fees and deposit requirements.
Ms Nelson said borrowers needed to consider the whole package to work out the cost of the loan.
Borrowers also face strict affordability checks that test whether they are able to cope with an interest rate rise.
Property website Rightmove also reported a rise in average asking prices, suggesting homes are becoming less affordable for first-time buyers.
It said new sellers' asking prices increased by 1.6%, or ??4,381, in April compared with March to reach ??286,133 on average across England and Wales, surpassing a previous peak reached last June.

article Belfast's MAC is the 500th member of Breastfeeding Welcome Here, in which venues show their support for the scheme by displaying a pink sticker.
A list of scheme members - from caf√É¬©s to libraries and church halls - can be found on the BreastFedBabies website.
The Department of Health says NI's breastfeeding rates have remained static for several years.
Mothers in Northern Ireland who choose to breastfeed also do so for a shorter period than breastfeeding mothers elsewhere in the UK, according to department figures.
The Breastfeeding Welcome Here initiative is being led by the Public Health Agency (PHA) and is designed to show community support for breastfeeding mothers.
Janet Calvert of the PHA said World Breastfeeding Week from 1-7 August offered an important opportunity to get that message across.
"Breastfeeding is the best start in life," she said.
"Showing increased support for breastfeeding mums is really important, as Northern Ireland has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the UK and one of the lowest rates in Europe.
"We know that for many mums, getting started isn't easy.
Information and support is essential, both before baby is born, and especially in the early days, so that mums can build their confidence and stay with their decision to breastfeed.
In January, the then health minister Michelle O'Neill promised to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to protect mothers who breastfeed in public.
This was shortly before the collapse of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive.
summary A number of Belfast venues have joined a campaign to encourage women to breastfeed.

article Cabozantinib has the potential to switch off tumours in some patients and could give them many months of good-quality life, doctors said.
Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the UK with around 12,000 new cases every year.
The drug has already been approved for use in Scotland.
A charity, Kidney Research UK, said treatment options for kidney cancer were limited and the newly-approved drug would offer patients "more hope and more time with their loved ones".
Sallyann Allenby, 61, from Surrey is being treated for renal cell carcinoma - the most common type of kidney cancer - at Guy's Hospital in London.
She had a kidney removed in 2013 after finding blood in her urine on holiday and then collapsing on the flight home.
Sallyann has tried several different treatments, one of which gave her unpleasant side-effects, and she has also participated in a clinical trial which did not work for her.
In July, she began another new treatment and said cabozantinib gave her another option.
"This is really another hope for people like me, it's something else to look forward to...
"It's bad enough having the cancer, but if you know there's something else you can try then that keeps you going.
"I've got two lovely granddaughters. I want to be around for a while yet."
In trials, the drug was shown to be useful in patients whose kidney cancer had spread around the body and had become resistant to other treatments.
The way cabozantinib works means it can target molecules on drug-resistant cancer cells, stopping the tumours or at least silencing them for a while.
It works very differently to chemotherapy drugs and also immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab, which is approved to treat advanced kidney cancer on the NHS.
Nivolumab harnesses the power of the patient's own immune system to destroy their cancer cells.
Symptoms of kidney cancer can include blood in the urine, persistent pain in the side of the body just below the ribs and a lump or swelling in the kidney area.
The cancer usually affects adults in their 60s or 70s and is rare in people under 50.
If it's caught early, kidney cancer can often be cured but a delay in diagnosis means a cure is less likely.
A spokesman from Kidney Research UK said: "We are pleased to see cabozantinib has been approved by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, offering patients with renal cell carcinoma an increased chance of improved progression-free survival, compared to the standard therapy."

She is also known for her portrayal of Leona in BBC drama Casualty and her role of Marilyn Dingle in Emmerdale.
A statement from AHA Talent Agency described her as a "brilliant, moving and funny actor".
Antony Cotton, who plays Sean Tully in Coronation Street, said: "Morag Siller. What a woman. She was a magnificent human being. Devastated."
"I feel very lucky to have met her but I am devastated that she has passed away, she was such an amazing, generous, kind woman and a fantastic actress - just a beautiful human being," said Sally Dynevor, who plays Sally Metcalfe in the soap.
As well as her TV acting Siller also appeared on stage, most recently as Voltemand in Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015 and as Puttana in 'Tis Pity She's A Whore at the Globe, and she had performed parts in Les Miserables and Mamma Mia.
AHA Talent Agency said: "Morag will also be remembered for her extraordinary warmth, generosity and mischievous sense of humour as well as the fearless determination she displayed as she fought cancer whilst simultaneously raising tens of thousands of pounds for local charities.
"She was a truly inspirational person who we are incredibly proud to have represented. We will miss her hugely."
Actor Lee Boardman, who appeared in Coronation Street, tweeted: "So sad to hear of the passing of the wonderful Morag Siller. She played my girlfriend in Ladies of Letters & was a delight. God bless you M."

article The hosts were 2-0 up after just 17 minutes thanks to goals from Julien de Sart and Darren Bent.
Kadeem Harris scored either side of half-time to bring the visitors level, and Craig Noone put them ahead with a fine curling effort.
Bent's header made it 3-3 but Ralls' injury-time penalty won it for Cardiff.
Victory lifts Neil Warnock's side up to 12th in the Championship table, just one place and five points behind Derby, who fall to 11th and are now eight points adrift of the top six.
Steve McClaren's men had recovered from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at home to Bristol City on Saturday, but on this occasion it was the Rams who were on the receiving end of a dramatic turnaround.
Derby looked in total control when De Sart struck on the rebound and Bent converted from Tom Ince's pass to put the home side 2-0 up.
But four minutes before the interval, Harris gave Cardiff hope when his deflected strike looped over Scott Carson in the home goal.
Harris then scored less than two minutes after the restart as he pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.
Cardiff led for the first time when Noone skilfully found the top corner from the edge of the box, but Bent appeared to have salvaged a point for Derby when he rose higher than Sean Morrison to head in.
However, there was a final twist in added time as Bluebirds substitute Rhys Healey was tripped by Alex Pearce, allowing Ralls to calmly stroke his penalty into the bottom corner.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:
"You score three goals at home and you expect to win but we haven't done that in the last two games. Why? Because we conceded seven goals.
"We've gone from a team who were hard to beat and defended very, very well to conceding seven in two games and you don't collect points doing that.
"This is the first defeat at home since September so let's not panic and over-react and say the wheels have come off, but we have to work hard on the training field."
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock:
"That's what you call old-fashioned football, end-to-end stuff and that's why I love the game. It was great to be involved in one like that, especially coming out on the right side.
"It gives me a lot of pride when I see us come to a place like this and stand up and be counted, and that's why I love the Championship more than any other league because you get genuine lads in this level.
"The goal before half-time helped us enormously. We talked about not thinking about drawing the game but trying to win it. I think we can go anywhere and give people a good game now. The biggest problem we've got is ourselves."

article The authority said demand is falling and that the properties in question are not up to modern standards.
Of the homes to close, three are in Carlisle, with two in Whitehaven and one each in Cleator Moor, Egremont, Ulverston and Walney Island.
Campaigners opposed to the plan said bed numbers will halve and put pressure on families and the NHS.
The decision to close the homes was taken at a Cumbria County Council cabinet meeting in Carlisle earlier and follows a public consultation.
The authority said two new properties in Carlisle and Copeland, the plans of which were approved in February 2016, will be sufficient to cope with demand.
They are expected to open in 2018.
Councillor Beth Furneaux said: "We can't do nothing. The homes we've got are not full, many are running close to half full.
"Most of the places we are closing, the environment isn't suitable for providing high levels of dementia care."
Seven campaigners from the Socialist Party held a protest outside the council's headquarters ahead of the vote.
One of them, Brent Kennedy, said: "We need more beds, not fewer.
"They're going to get rid of 137 beds. That's going to cause problems for elderly people, their carers and families. It's also going to cause problems for the NHS."

article Ministers wanted employees to organise the payment of union dues themselves by other means such as direct debit.
But unions argued that this would be more complicated for members and so lead to a loss of funds.
Lord Bridges of Headley announced a "pause" in the plans, saying there were "cannons" attacking them on all sides.
He told peers the government would change the Trade Union Bill to remove the end to "check-off" at its next stage in the House of Lords, saying the move had never been intended to undermine the union movement.
"Arguments have been made with considerable vim and vigour that by ending check-off and moving to direct debit, those on low pay and especially those who have pay day loans might have to cease being trade union members or have to pay extra bank charges," he said.
"Again, this is not our intention and never has been."
The payment of subscriptions by deduction from wages can now continue - providing the union bears the administrative cost.
The Conservative peer who led the parliamentary campaign against the move, Lord Balfe, said he was "delighted" to be able to tear up the speech he had been about to make opposing the government.
"I think it was clear to anyone who looked at the detail that the government's proposals on check-off stood to do considerable damage both to the unions themselves and to their members and potential members," he said.
"I was particularly concerned about the impact on low paid, mostly female workers, who stood to lose out on the protection and benefits of trade union membership."
The TUC welcomed the U-turn, thanking all of those who had lobbied the government over the issue.
"Banning workers from choosing to pay union subs in a convenient way through their payroll would, as many have warned, damaged industrial relations and morale in key services," said its general secretary Frances O'Grady.
"While this is an important milestone, the TUC remains opposed to the Trade Union Bill in its entirety and will continue to push for further changes when it is debated again in the House of Commons next week."
Ministers are standing by other key aspects of the bill, such as the introduction of electronic balloting and restrictions on political funds used by unions for campaigning, despite a series of defeats in the Lords.

article James Comey spoke to US politicians as the war of words between the FBI and Apple intensified.
The FBI has asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook who killed 14 people in December 2015.
Apple has refused, saying the protection of personal data was "incredibly important".
"This is the hardest question I have seen in government and it's going to require negotiation and conversation," Mr Comey told the House Intelligence Committee.
"I love encryption, I love privacy, and when I hear corporations saying we're going to take you to a world where no one can look at your stuff, part of me thinks that's great," he said.
However, he added, law enforcement saved lives, rescued children and prevented terror attacks using search warrants that gave it access to information on mobile phones.
"We are going to move to a world where that is not possible anymore," he said. "The world will not end but it will be a different world than where we are today and where we were in 2014."
People needed to understand "the costs associated with moving to a world of universal strong encryption", he added.
Mr Comey said it should be left to Congress and others to decide about what counted as reasonable law enforcement access to encrypted data.
He also said if Apple did unlock the phone it was "unlikely to be a trailblazer" for many future cases. The speed with which the technology in smartphones changes meant any defects Apple exploited to get at data would not be present in newer gadgets. Despite this, he added that it would be "instructive" for other courts.
At another hearing Microsoft President Brad Smith said it would be filing an amicus brief to support Apple's position.
Mr Smith told a House Judiciary Committee that Microsoft "wholeheartedly" supported Apple on the issue of resisting calls to unlock the phone.
Earlier this week Microsoft founder Bill Gates said the row should prompt a debate about the access that law enforcement gets to data in terror investigations.
The row between Apple and the FBI over the phone of Farook blew up last week when the bureau asked the electronics firm for help to unlock the smartphone. Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and wounded 22 others during the attack in San Bernadino.
So far, Apple has refused to unlock the phone. In an interview aired yesterday with US TV network ABC, Apple boss Tim Cook said the FBI was asking it to make "the software equivalent of cancer".
He added: "Some things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things."
Apple has until 26 February to formally respond to the FBI order.

article Brian Carberry, 49, from Downpatrick, received haemophilia treatment as a child in the 1970s.
In the 1970s and 1980s some blood products used to treat the disease were imported from the US.
They included donations from prisoners, who were at risk of hepatitis C or HIV.
At least 2,400 people died as a result of the contamination.
The government announcement that a UK-wide inquiry will be held into the scandal on Tuesday.
Families of those who died will be consulted about what form the inquiry should take.
It could be a public Hillsborough-style inquiry or a judge-led statutory inquiry, the prime minister has said.
Mr Carberry, who is one of about 6,000 people across the UK to have been infected with hepatitis C, said he was "relieved" that a public inquiry will be launched.
"I want to see the truth, accountability. This is with the government and Department of Health - they need to answer for it," he added.
"The victims need to be involved right in the centre of it.
"They're the ones with the evidence and they are the ones who need the answers.
"The bureaucrats can't do it, and the Department of Health can't look at itself so it needs to be an independent inquiry."
The scandal has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.

But it said there was no evidence of "endemic" corruption.
And it added that most officers and staff were "honest and professional".
In the report, entitled Integrity Matters, HMIC said systems for handling corruption "varied considerably" between forces, and that too few forces were able to identify and analyse the threats and take proactive steps to catch corrupt officers.
The inspectors also raised concerns that anti-corruption investigators were not using their full powers - such as carrying out searches and drug tests - and as a result were missing opportunities to gather evidence.
The report also suggested it was "impossible" to know the extent of corruption as there was no agreed definition of the term.
To identify corruption, the report therefore complied data on behaviours "most likely" to involve corruption: drug-related offences, bribery, theft, sexual misconduct and unauthorised information disclosure.
HMIC raised concerns about the fact that fewer than a third of the 3,070 investigations into allegations in these categories in the 12 months up to March 2014 resulted in "management action", written warnings, dismissals or resignations.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Mike Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that one reason for cases being dropped was that they were discovered to be "unfounded or malicious".
But he added: "We cannot rule out that some of those allegations have not been properly inquired into or investigated."

The more you look for it, the more you'll find it - that's the key message on police corruption from this 226-page report.
And some forces aren't looking hard enough - they're failing to identify the threats, develop intelligence and use their full powers to root out corrupt officers.
As the report says, it may partly be down to a lack of resources and specialist capability: this is difficult work, which sometimes involves using the most sophisticated covert techniques against colleagues.
But is it also because some officers lack the motivation to investigate their own?
The report doesn't answer that.
But it does suggest that ethical standards remain high - so high in fact that some beat officers refuse to accept cups of tea from members of the public in case their acceptance of hospitality is misinterpreted.
The report, rightly, says that's going too far.
Mr Cunningham said police forces had made "great strides" in tackling misconduct and corruption, and they must now "focus on proactive prevention work".
He said senior officers were demonstrating "commitment" to stopping corruption, and officers were "quick to tell us that they see corrupt colleagues as a betrayal of the vast majority who are honourable, decent and hard-working".
He added: "We know only too well that the corrosive nature of corruption means that even a single case can be damaging to public confidence."
The Inspectorate also said that, while more than three quarters of the 17,200 officers surveyed felt they were encouraged to challenge unethical behaviour, only "just over half" said they trusted the confidentiality of internal reporting systems.
The report, commissioned by Home Secretary Theresa May, found the majority of forces had "maintained or increased staffing levels" in anti-corruption units despite budget cuts.
The College of Policing said its code of ethics was being adopted by all forces and it was exploring how counter-corruption training could be expanded.
The college's chief executive, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, added: "Work has already begun to provide guidance to forces for best practice in managing whistleblowing.
"This should increase confidence among officers that their force will know how to deal with any disclosure appropriately."

article Before Olympic champion Dame Mary Peters turned off the last of the UK's analogue TV signals in Belfast, a series of graphics on Ceefax's front page disappeared down to a small dot.
The Plain English Campaign earlier gave Ceefax a lifetime achievement award for "clarity" and use of "everyday words".
And ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major said Ceefax would be "much missed".
Sir John, who has previously revealed that he regularly checked Ceefax pages between Downing Street meetings to keep up to date with cricket scores, said: "Ceefax will be much missed. At moments of high pressure - with little time for detailed examination of the news - Ceefax headlines offered an instant window on the world.
"From breaking global news to domestic sports news, Ceefax was speedy, accurate and indispensable. It can be proud of its record."
A few weeks after Ceefax provided coverage of its 10th and final Olympic Games, Lord Coe added his own tribute by saying: "Ceefax has been an invaluable news service for every sports fan over the last 38 years.
"I have checked in on many a sports news story, track and field triumph and, of course, Chelsea results!"
Ceefax was launched on 23 September 1974 to give BBC viewers the chance to check the latest news headlines, sports scores, weather forecast or TV listings - in a pre-internet era where the only alternative was to wait for the next TV or radio bulletin to be aired.
Its premise was to give viewers free access to the same information that was coming into the BBC newsroom, as soon as the BBC's journalists had received it.
Ceefax had initially been developed when BBC engineers, exploring ways to provide subtitles to enable viewers with hearing problems to enjoy BBC TV programmes, found it was possible to transmit full pages of text information in the "spare lines" transmitted on the analogue TV signal.
10 things you didn't know about Ceefax
The BBC then appointed veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, its former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer, as the first editor of a news and information service which was broadcast using the same method.
It was called Ceefax, simply because viewers would be able to quickly "see the facts" of any story of the day.
McIntyre initially updated 24 news pages on his own, feeding punch tape into machines, before recruiting Ceefax's first eight journalists.
Initially the service was a minority interest, with just a handful of Ceefax-capable TVs in the UK, but it slowly started to gain popularity and the engineering team that developed the service was honoured with a Queen's Award for innovation.
But the real impetus for viewers came when BBC Television decided to use a selection of Ceefax pages, accompanied by music, before the start of programming each day. Initially called Ceefax AM and Ceefax In Vision, the Pages From Ceefax "programme" continued for 30 years, being broadcast overnight on BBC Two until this week.
As viewers got a small taste of what Ceefax had to offer, millions of Britons during the 1980s invested in new teletext-enabled TV sets which gave them access to the full Ceefax service, which by now included recipe details for dishes prepared on BBC cookery shows, share prices, music reviews and an annual advent calendar.
Its audience peaked in the 1990s when it had 20 million viewers who checked the service at least once a week. Since the launch of the National Lottery in 1994, dozens of jackpot winners have revealed that they first learned their life had been changed when they checked their numbers on Ceefax.
But the launch of the UK's TV digital signal, and the announcement that the analogue TV signal would disappear in a staged switch-off over five years, meant a slow withdrawal of Ceefax, ending with the final broadcast in Northern Ireland.
BBC Northern Ireland and UTV screened a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV, and then Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - pressed the button to change the television landscape.
The hour-long special programme, The Magic Box, was hosted by Eamonn Holmes.
The show was billed as a nostalgic celebration of "the best of Northern Ireland television over the past 60 years".
Speaking as he closed the simulcast programme, Mr Holmes thanked viewers for watching and said: "Here's to the next 60 years."
By Mort  SmithOriginal Ceefax staff member
The early days of the service proved anything but hi-tech.
Ceefax journalists would monitor incoming wire copy and when a story was to be updated they would type at one of two production terminals and create a Ceefax page.
Then, they had to produce a punched tape - approximately a yard long - and take it down two flights of stairs to the Central Apparatus Room, load it into a tape reader and watch as it was read into an anonymous metal box called a core store which actually transmitted the pages.
A walk back up to the sixth floor followed and if, at that point, it was discovered that a spelling mistake had been made, the journalist had to go through the whole process again.
It ensured close attention to detail when writing!
Read Mort's memories in full
Dame Mary described the role of switching off the last analogue transmitter, at Divis Mountain in Belfast, as "a great privilege".
Viewers who checked Ceefax during the evening saw a special graphics countdown on page 100.
And weather presenters on the BBC during the day paid their own tribute by incorporating Ceefax's Lego block-style maps into their forecasts.
Ceefax's commitment to getting information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible has been marked by the lifetime achievement award from the Plain English Campaign, the pressure group that calls for the use of concise and clear language in all public communication.
Founder Chrissie Maher said:  "Ceefax helped everyday people with everyday words and I will be giving it a Chrissie Maher Award for its 30 years of commitment to using plain English. It was my first port of call."
She added: "It helped the public keep in touch with world affairs and everyday information with its crystal-clear communications. I will miss its clarity."
Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said in response: "Throughout its distinguished years of service to audiences, Ceefax has always aimed to provide news which is clear, concise and simply expressed.
"It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story."
Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: "Ceefax revolutionised the way in which the public accessed information. Its peak audience of 20 million viewers is testament to the regard in which it was held - its cessation a reminder of how quickly technology is now progressing."
Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, said: "Ceefax is a great national institution, and it's sad to bid goodbye to a service which gave so many access to news, sport, TV listings and much else besides.
"But with the end of one era comes the start of another as the digital switchover is completed - people can access more channels, and interactive services which are the successors of Ceefax."

article David Robertson, former master distiller for The Macallan, plans to open the Holyrood Park Distillery.
If plans are approved, the √Ç¬£2m distillery will be housed in the Engine Shed building and will be open to visitors.
Glen Sciennes was the last single malt whisky distillery to operate in Edinburgh before its closure in 1925.
Edinburgh councillors have agreed to lease the Engine Shed building to the company.
The proposals are now subject to planning approval.
Mr Robertson said: "We are very excited by the prospect of resurrecting the proud tradition of distilling single malt whisky in Edinburgh.
"We hope to be able to create an immersive and entertaining visitor experience, supporting the local economy through jobs and training opportunities while reinforcing the capital's position as a world-class tourism destination.
"Most importantly, our goal is to create beautiful, hand-crafted single malt whiskies which will stand shoulder to shoulder with the other great single malts that are now being produced in Scotland and elsewhere."
The business aims to start distilling whisky by next summer and release a single malt whisky within four years.
It would initially employ up to 25 staff at varying levels, from trainees up to experienced distillery operators, tourism and production managers.
Former railway building the Engine Shed operated until recently as a cafe and bakery employing adults with learning difficulties.

article The leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan signed the agreement in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
Egypt has opposed the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, saying it would worsen its water shortages.
Ethiopia says the dam will give it a fairer share of Nile waters.
In 2013, Ethiopia's parliament ratified a controversial treaty to replace colonial-era agreements that gave Egypt and Sudan the biggest share of the Nile's water.
Egypt's then-President Mohamed Morsi said he did not want war but he would not allow Egypt's water supply to be endangered by the dam.
Mr Morsi's successor, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi signed the deal with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn and Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.
The three leaders welcomed the "declaration of principles" agreement in speeches in Khartoum's Republican Palace, and watched a short film about the Grand Renaissance Dam that highlighted how it could benefit the region, the Associated Press news agency reports.
Mr Halemariam said he wanted to give an assurance that the dam would "not cause any harm to downstream countries", Reuters news agency reports.
Mr Sisi said the project remained a source of concern to Egypt.
"The Renaissance Dam project represents a source of development for the millions of Ethiopia's citizens through producing green and sustainable energy, but for their brothers living on the banks of that very Nile in Egypt, and who approximately equal them in numbers, it represents a source of concern and worry," he said.
"This is because the Nile is their only source of water, in fact their source of life."
Ethiopia wants to replace a 1929 treaty written by Britain that awarded Egypt veto power over any project involving the Nile by upstream countries.
Ethiopia says the $4.7bn (√Ç¬£3.1bn) dam will eventually provide 6,000 megawatts of power.
Egypt was apparently caught by surprise when Ethiopia started diverting the Blue Nile - a tributary of the Nile - in 2013.
Ethiopia says the river will be slightly diverted but will then be able to follow its natural course.
Egyptian politicians were inadvertently heard on live TV in 2013, proposing military action over the dam.
Ethiopia has received strong backing from five other Nile-basin countries - Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Burundi.

article Mr Brown said Labour must not become "a party of permanent protest".
He said he was not attacking a leadership candidate, but some comments appeared to warn against Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn's team said he was most likely to engage non-Labour voters.
The other candidates are Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham.
Mr Brown's comments come as a poll suggested Mr Corbyn is considered the candidate most likely to worsen Labour's prospects of winning the next election.
Polls also suggest Mr Corbyn is the front-runner in the leadership race.
Mr Brown did not use Mr Corbyn's name but made it clear he disagreed with many of his economic and social policies.
He said the UK must continue to build international alliances under a future Labour government.
He added: "I have to say that if our global alliances are going to be alliances with Hezbollah and Hamas and Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Vladimir Putin's Russia, there is absolutely no chance of building a world-wide alliance that can deal with poverty and inequality and climate change and financial instability, and we've got to face up to that fact."
Mr Corbyn has previously described Hezbollah as "friends" and said that he wanted Hamas to be "part of the debate".
Analysis: Alex Forsyth, political correspondent, BBC News
Gordon Brown didn't need to mention Jeremy Corbyn's name for his message to be understood; if he wins the leadership race Labour risks electoral oblivion.
The warning was couched in more subtle terms than those used previously by people who've called Mr Corbyn a potential car crash, but it was no less potent.
Steeped in references to Labour's past, this was a speech designed to tug heart strings from a man who commands the attention of some on Labour's left.
The question will be whether it makes any difference.
Many of Mr Corbyn's supporters say he provides an alternative to the current political system - so they may not be swayed by the views of established politicians.
Mr Brown also referred repeatedly to the need for Labour to become more than a party of protest - while also warning it needed to be different from the Tories.
"What I am here to say is that the best way of realising our high ideals is to show that we have an alternative in government that is credible, that is radical, and is electable - is neither a pale imitation of what the Tories offer nor is it the route to being a party of permanent protest, rather than a party of government," he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said part of the speech was as much a "coded dig" at Ms Kendall as it was at Mr Corbyn.
Mr Brown went on: "It is not a mistake to want power. It is not a mistake to do what is necessary to get back to power."
The former MP also said the party had to offer "hope" to the public that it could be an alternative government.
"I believe that our vote is both a public duty and a sacred trust.
"It is a public duty because we have got to show that the Labour Party can be at the service of the country and that we can change society for the better in the future," he said.
Last week, Mr Brown's predecessor at Number 10, Tony Blair, warned that Labour risked annihilation if it elected Mr Corbyn.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was the candidate "most likely to engage with voters beyond Labour's existing supporters" and credibility did not mean signing up to austerity.
Ms Cooper said it was "no good just being angry at the world if you can't change the world".
Mr Burnham said the country "needs a strong opposition" and Mr Brown and others "need to be listened to".
Earlier, Ms Kendall insisted she had no intention of stepping aside in the race, with polls suggesting she is lagging behind other candidates.
Mr Brown spoke after a ComRes study of 2,035 adults in Britain, for the Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror, found 31% of those polled thought Mr Corbyn would worsen Labour's prospects of electoral success. Mr Burnham was the poll's least damaging candidate.
Conversely though, 21% thought Mr Corbyn would be most likely to boost Labour's chances of winning the next election.

article After James Brophy forced an early save from Angus Gunn, Oliver Lancashire headed home a free-kick to put the visitors in front at Carrow Road.
But Cameron Jerome quickly levelled and Wes Hoolahan played a one-two with James Maddison before making it two.
Maddison soon added the third and, although Paul Mullin pulled one back after the break, it was not enough.
Norwich made three changes to the side that drew at Fulham on Saturday, with Hoolahan, Ivo Pinto and Josh Murphy coming in to the side, but it was Maddison who was at the heart of most of their attacking play in the opening half, as well as clearing off the line from Harry Smith.
Swindon, though, refused to give up despite the two-goal interval deficit and, after Mullin headed in from a Chris Hussey set-piece, Gunn had to make an excellent save to deny him a second and keep out late efforts by Ellis Iandolo and James Dunne to prevent Town taking the tie to extra-time.

article Mr Xi's comments came at an annual China-US dialogue held in Beijing.
Diplomats are expected to discuss China's currency, North Korea and tensions in the South China Sea.
The US delegation is led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who in his opening remarks said that the US was not seeking to "contain" China.
Mr Xi said the two countries' interests were now "more than ever interconnected", with much to gain from co-operation.
"China-US confrontation, to the two countries and the world, would definitely be a disaster," he said.
"We should mutually respect and treat each other equally, and respect the other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect each other's choice on the path of development."
Mr Kerry, meanwhile, said the US did "not seek to contain China" and urged Beijing not to "interpret it as an overall strategy" when the US differed from China on certain issues.
US President Barack Obama also said in a statement that the US "welcomes the emergence of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous China".
"We remain determined to ensure that co-operation defines the overall relationship," he said.
But US leaders have also called on China to do its part in maintaining stability in Asia.
Mr Kerry said the US welcomed a China that "contributes to the stability and development of the region and chooses to play a responsible role in world affairs".
The talks come with China locked in bitter disputes with several neighbours in the region, notably Vietnam and the Philippines, over claims in the South China Sea.
In turn, the US has stepped up joint military exercises with the Philippines and its military presence there, a move over which China has raised concerns. One of the latest exercises was conducted in the South China Sea near disputed waters two weeks ago.
Increased anti-Japan rhetoric has also come from China in recent weeks, following a decision by the Japanese cabinet to reinterpret the constitution, giving the Japanese military greater latitude to fight overseas.
Both countries claim a string of islands in the East China Sea and ties are severely strained over this issue.
The US and China have also had disagreements in recent months, particularly over cyber-attacks.
In May, US authorities charged five Chinese military officers with hacking into American businesses. Beijing has vigorously denied the charges, accusing the US of launching cyber-attacks against China.

article Official figures showed 23,994 support staff were employed by schools across Wales in 2016 but that was 446 fewer compared to 12 months earlier.
The number of teachers is also down by 275 to 23,235.
But the Welsh Government said the pupil-teacher ratio has remained "relatively" stable.
"After years of cuts, head teachers have little wriggle room but to look at the staffing they have," Owen Hathway, the National Union of Teachers policy officer in Wales told Welsh language news programme Newyddion 9.
"This needs to be avoided because any teacher or classroom assistant that is lost puts more pressure on that staff who are still there.
"That isn't fair on the children when we're trying to ensure they get the best education in Wales."
Jess Turner, from Unison which represents ancillary staff in schools, said schools needed more than just teachers to run properly.
She added: "Every time a caretaker, cleaner or admin worker loses their job it means more pressure on classroom staff.
"Those who remain do their best to keep up standards in their schools but with fewer staff, safety and security is bound to be compromised."
Tegwen Ellis, head teacher at Ysgol Cynwyd Sant in Maesteg, said accessing more money was essential in order to reduce pressure.
Her school's budget is √Ç¬£70,000 less in this academic year - a situation not uncommon across Wales - but they have managed to bridge that gap by securing further grants from elsewhere.
"Some schools get sponsorship from businesses, some schools are working alongside businesses to develop children in a different way, and we as a school have to think in a different way as well," she said.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are well aware of the financial challenges facing our schools and have prioritised funding for schools within the settlement we provide for local government in Wales.
"Over the past five years to 2016, there has been a reduction in teacher numbers but the pupil-teacher ratio has remained relatively stable (18.4 to 18.6)."
The spokesman added there were 1,700 more support staff than five years ago.

article He said the Lib Dems had too often tried to emulate the Conservatives and Labour, warning that Westminster was a "beguiling place".
Mr Farron urged activists to focus on community politics to find their "path back to power", in a speech in York.
The party was reduced from 57 to eight MPs at the 2015 general election.
Its election defeat triggered the resignation of then-leader Nick Clegg, and the party lost its status as the third largest party in Parliament - a mantle now held by the SNP.
Speaking on the final day of the Lib Dem spring conference, Mr Farron told members he was "dead proud" that the Lib Dems "put country before party" by entering into government with the Conservatives in 2010.
"But were the seeds of our setback in May sown many years before? Because Westminster can be a beguiling place," he said.
"When you are there, there's constant temptation to try and be like everyone else," he said.
"We arrive in the big league on our terms. But we too often attempt to remain on theirs," he warned, and appealed to his party: "We must return to our roots.
"No matter the office, always remaining true to our instincts.
"It's time to focus not on parliamentary games, but on real life. It's time we got back to community politics."
Mr Farron also used his speech to call for tax reform ahead of Wednesday's Budget, accusing the government of "fawning" over big business at the expense of small businesses.
"Google and Facebook can negotiate with the tax office for months, yet small businesses can't even get through on the phone," he said.
And he suggested: "Instead of government fawning over the multinationals how about putting small business at the centre of our business economy."
Mr Farron announced that he had appointed former Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable would lead an expert panel looking at ways to "radically reform" business taxation.
On Sunday's Andrew Marr Show, Chancellor George Osborne defended the controversial √Ç¬£130m tax deal Google reached with HMRC, branded as "derisory" by critics.
He said the government was raising money from Google and Facebook unlike before adding: "I think that is a success."

article The German publication claims to have seen secret documents from the National Security Agency which show Mrs Merkel's number on a list dating from 2002 - before she became chancellor.
Another report says Mr Obama was told in 2010 about the surveillance.
Meanwhile Washington has seen a protest against the NSA's spying programme.
Several thousand protesters marched to the US Capitol to demand a limit to the surveillance. Some of them held banners in support of the fugitive former contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed the extent of the NSA's activities.
The nature of the monitoring of Mrs Merkel's mobile phone is not clear from the files, Der Spiegel says.
For example, it is possible that the chancellor's conversations were recorded, or that her contacts were simply assessed.
Germany is sending its top intelligence chiefs to Washington in the coming week to "push forward" an investigation into the spying allegations, which have caused outrage in Germany.
Mrs Merkel phoned the US president when she first heard of the spying allegations on Wednesday.
President Barack Obama apologised to the German chancellor and promised Mrs Merkel he knew nothing of the alleged phone monitoring and would have stopped it if he had, Der Spiegel reports.
But on Sunday Bild newspaper quoted US intelligence sources as saying NSA head Keith Alexander personally briefed the president about the covert operation targeting Mrs Merkel in 2010.
"Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue," the newspaper quoted a senior NSA official as saying.
Her number was still on a surveillance list in 2013.
On Friday, Germany and France said they wanted the US to sign a no-spy deal by the end of the year.
As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls made by German and French citizens.
By Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin
This scandal has caused one of the biggest diplomatic rifts between Germany and the US in recent years.
A close ally of Mrs Merkel told the BBC that she was personally very hurt by the idea of being spied on by American friends.
The chancellor is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying that she had to deal with while growing up in Communist East Germany.
The documents seen by Der Spiegel give further details of the NSA's targeting of European governments.
A unit called Special Collection Services, based on the fourth floor of the US embassy in Pariser Platz in Berlin, was responsible for monitoring communications in the German capital's government quarter, including those targeting Mrs Merkel.
Germany's Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Bild that running such an operation on German soil would be illegal under German law, and adds that those "responsible must be held accountable".
A criminal investigation would take the current scandal out of the hands of diplomats and politicians, and so make it harder to control politically, says the BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin.
Similar listening units were based in around 80 locations worldwide, according to the documents seen by Der Spiegel, 19 of them in European cities.
If the existence of listening stations in US embassies were known, there would be "severe damage for the US's relations with a foreign government," the documents said.
The US government had a second German spy base in Frankfurt am Main, the magazine reports.
The scandal has caused the biggest diplomatic rift between Germany and the US in living memory, reports the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin.
Mrs Merkel - an Americophile who was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 - is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying she had to endure growing up in Communist East Germany.

article The aviary acts like a seed bank for poultry, storing primordial stem cells that produce eggs destined to hatch male or female offspring.
The Edinburgh University team  have collected more than 500 samples from 25 different breeds.
The cells are held in a freezer at -150C and will be viable for decades.
The researchers at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute want to preserve rare poultry breeds that may be resistant to infections such as bird flu or have desirable traits such as high meat quality.
The first step was to create the GM hens capable of laying eggs from multiple different rare breeds, which include the colourfully-named "rumpless game", "Scots dumpy", "Sicilian buttercup", and "Old English pheasant fowl".
This was done using gene editing technology to target part of a gene called DDX4 which is vital for bird fertility.
The scientists knocked out the gene to create an egg containing a sterile chick.
However, after one of the stem cells was implanted into that egg it instead hatched into a GM surrogate which could go on to produce eggs and chicks from the chosen rare breed.
Lead scientist Dr Mike McGrew said: "These chickens are a first step in saving and protecting rare poultry breeds from loss in order to preserve future biodiversity of our poultry from both economic and climate stresses."
He spoke about the project to journalists at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Dr McGrew said there were strong parallels with seed banks aimed at preserving rare and endangered plant species.
He added: "We call it the frozen aviary because we want to freeze down these stem cells from a lot of different breeds of poultry, starting with chickens.
"Then we'd like to freeze down other breeds of poultry like geese; quail also.
"Our success so far is just with chickens but our plans are to do this with other bird species."
To what extent it might be possible to use chickens as surrogate mothers for different bird species - not merely breeds - remains an unanswered question.
Dr McGrew said: "No-one knows if you transplanted these cells between different bird species if they would be able to make an egg from a different bird species.
"I have my doubts that it would work."
While the chances of a chicken laying an eagle egg were remote, he thought the process could suit closely-related species such as different varieties of duck or goose.
Rare chickens come in a wide variety of different shapes, sizes and colours, and a number have some very unusual features.
One, the Dong Tao chicken, has oversized stumpy legs considered to be a delicacy in its native Vietnam.
Richard Broad, from the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, said: "The idea behind it really interests us.
"Basically you can just have a gene bank of rare breeds in the freezer. You can save all kinds of breeds, put them in a freezer and there would be a genetic ark for us.
"If you had one in every country, it would be a wonderful thing."

article Prime minister David Cameron has said he will take part in only one.
Mr Clegg accused the Conservatives of attempting to "dictate the terms" of the debates.
Broadcasters have said plans for three TV general election debates in April will go ahead.
"It is a little bit arrogant of the Conservatives to somehow assume that they can, you know, dictate terms - these aren't the debates run by the Conservative Party. They belong to the British people," Mr Clegg said.
He added: "If David Cameron is too important or too busy to turn up, if he doesn't want to defend the record of this coalition government, then I will."
Labour leader Ed Miliband on Saturday formally accepted invitations to appear in all three of the live TV debates on April 2, 16 and 30.
He told the Scottish Labour conference: "I say to David Cameron: You can refuse to face the public, but you can't deny your record. You can try to chicken out of the debates, but don't ever again claim that you provide strong leadership."
Downing Street has said it will not back down on its "final offer" of one seven-way debate in March.
It has blamed broadcasters for creating a "chaotic" situation during negotiations around the debates.
Sky, the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV have invited the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, UKIP, the SNP, the Green Party of England and Wales and Plaid Cymru to take part in two debates lasting two hours each during the election campaign.
As it stands, the broadcasters have said the debates will go ahead as originally planned, while a planned head-to-head encounter between the Conservative and Labour leaders will also continue on 30 April.
Mr Clegg's comments are similar to those previously made by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who said that David Cameron "simply cannot be allowed to dictate terms to everyone else taking part."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has also put forward a similar point of view when she said: "It would have been wrong for one individual to dictate and change the terms of these debates."
However, Peter Robinson, leader of the DUP and First Minister of Northern Ireland, said it was the broadcasters who were trying to "set down a diktat" with their plans.
Mr Miliband has previously accused Mr Cameron of "running scared" from TV debates, and "cowering from the public".
However, Mr Cameron has said he wants to "unblock the logjam" the "broadcasters helped to create" by appearing in one debate.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said UKIP will "accept the challenge" of the debates, but has criticised broadcasters for changing the original proposals and agreeing to let more parties take part.
The Greens have said the proposed format of the debates is "very fair" and that Mr Cameron's stance was damaging to the reputation of politics.

article The Boundary Commission for Wales will set out a new parliamentary map of Wales, a Wales with 29 rather than the current 40 MPs.
In the same week, MPs will conclude their debates on the Wales Bill, which is designed to simplify the devolution settlement.
Shadow Leader of the Commons (and Shadow Welsh Secretary) Paul Flynn linked the two events during his latest appearance in the House of Commons.  He suggested they would illustrate "the degraded system that our democracy is and the way it's heading into further distress".
He added: "The Welsh Bill won't guarantee in any way a compensatory increase in the number of members of the Welsh Assembly, although their work level has trebled.
"But in the future Wales will lose eleven of the 40 MPs, will lose the four MEPs that represent Wales and we've got this great turmoil in our democratic system when the disgrace of buying places in the House of Lords continues."
Mr Flynn, whose own work level has increased in recent months, didn't mention that the Wales Bill will actually give the assembly the power to increase the number of AMs, should it wish.
But he did criticise the boundary changes as likely to disenfranchise two million people (across England and Wales) and favour only the Conservatives.
Commons leader David Lidington told Mr Flynn: "I was sorry by the disparaging tone you adopted towards the Wales Bill because after all what this government's record in Wales has been about is delivering the increased devolution which the Welsh people, the Welsh Assembly and political parties, for the most part in Wales, have been saying that they wanted to see
"And I was...I suppose I wasn't shocked.....I was disheartened by the critical remarks he threw in about the approach of the parliamentary Boundary Commission and the framework within which they are operating."
It transpired that Mr Lidington had been flicking through Mr Flynn's memoirs, in which there is strong praise for the Chartists, who, said the Commons leader, favoured constituencies with equal numbers of electors in each constituency.
"I'd have thought he'd have been cheering us on and not criticising us for doing it."

article A US judge found Japanese bank Nomura made false statements when selling bonds to US agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.
Of the seven deals, RBS underwrote four valued at a total of $2bn (√Ç¬£1.28bn)..
The ruling opens the door for US authorities to recover $450m.
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are US government backed agencies that buy mortgages from banks and sell them as bonds to investors on the open market.
The value of those bonds plummeted in the wake of the financial crisis.
District Judge Denise Cote ruled in favour of a suit brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) saying supporting documents offered by Nomura "did not correctly describe the mortgage loans".
"The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous," she added.
Judge Cote said the securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "were supported by loans for which the underwriting process had failed," with deals comprised of 45% to 59% "materially defective" mortgages.
Nomura's lawyers claimed any losses incurred by Fannie and Freddie were not the banks' fault and were due to overall market conditions.
But the judge said the banks "have not quantified the loss that they say is due to macroeconomic factors".
Nor did the banks deny that "there is a link between the securitization frenzy associated with those shoddy practices and the very macroeconomic factors that they say caused the losses to the certificates," she wrote.
The exact amount of damages to be awarded was unclear. Judge Cote ordered the FHFA to submit a proposed judgment with updated damages figures based on her ruling by Friday.
But she said the FHFA was entitled to $624.4m, minus more than $178m in payments already made since the lawsuit began in 2011.
The FHFA welcomed the ruling, despite the amount appearing to be significantly lower than the $1bn it had sought during the trial.
FHFA general counsel Alfred Pollard said: "It is clear the court found that the facts presented by FHFA were convincing."
Nomura said in a statement that it planned to appeal, saying it was "confident that it was consistently candid, transparent and professional in all of its dealings with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac".
RBS declined to comment.
The lawsuit is the only one to so far have gone as far as a trial out of the 18 lawsuits file by the US regulator filed in 2011 regarding $200bn worth of mortgage-bonds sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by numerous banks in the lead up to the financial crisis.
The FHFA has already reached settlements worth a total of $17.9bn with banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank.

article The suspect can be seen taking the 25-year-old woman across Tennant Street, Birmingham, on 19 October 2014, minutes before she was attacked.
The woman had shown "remarkable courage" by allowing the release of the footage, West Midlands Police said.
An image of a key witness, known as Kevin, has previously been released.
The witness, who is believed to be in his 20s, with dwarfism, left the Walkabout bar on Broad Street with the woman at 04:00 BST.
The pair walked towards Granville Street, where the suspect - described as a black man - spoke to Kevin and scooped the woman into his arms, leaving Kevin alone, police said.
A short time later a report was made to the police when a member of the public found the woman in a highly distressed state.
Det Con Danette Calvey said: "There will undoubtedly be people who will watch these images and wrongly judge the woman.
"It must be remembered that this woman has been attacked and that she has displayed remarkable courage by allowing us to release the footage.
"She hopes that these new images may jog someone's memory and that their call may make the difference to her attacker being caught or left to roam the streets."
Det Con Calvey said police were still looking for Kevin, who is believed to have short dark hair.
Asked about the gap between the attack and the CCTV being put out, the force said it did not take decisions to release "footage like this lightly" due to the distress it could cause victims.
But the force said with the woman's consent it had "deemed the time is now right" in the hope the CCTV would prompt new leads.

article The objects that have either come ashore or brought close to isles in stormy weather have included lost pieces of military hardware and massive containers and even a boat carrying an empty coffin.
In 2009, a Canadian author was reunited with a message in a bottle following its 2,000-mile, five month-long journey across the Atlantic.
Ross Traverse had expected the bottle to wash up somewhere along the coast from his home in Torbay, Newfoundland.
However, it was found by two RSPB Scotland workers during a beach clean on Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides.
Mr Traverse travelled by plane, train, ferry and small boat to reach the isle to collect his message and bottle.
Four years ago, a Scots fisherman set a new Guinness World Record after finding a message in a bottle 98 years after it was released.
Andrew Leaper's discovery east of Shetland beat the previous record for the longest time a bottle had been adrift at sea by more than five years.
The drift bottle - containing a postcard which promised a reward of six pence to the finder - was released in June 1914 by Captain CH Brown of the Glasgow School of Navigation.
It was in a batch of 1,890 scientific research bottles which were specially designed to sink to help map the currents of the seas around Scotland when they were returned. About 300 of them have been found.
"Today's shout had an air of transatlantic mystery," said the RNLI following an unusual discovery in July 2013.
Tobermory lifeboat crew found what appeared to be a US Coastguard-certified craft with bullet holes in it off Muck in the Small Isles.
The RNLI said the upturned 14ft aluminium dinghy appeared to have been in the water for some time.
Just days earlier, the same Isle of Mull-based crew also recovered a large red object that resembled targets towed out to sea and used by the military.
The west coast of Scotland is used as a training area during the twice yearly UK-led Nato exercise Joint Warrior, and the red target was thought to be connected to that exercise.
In October 2015, another military target drone was found washed up on at the beach at Baleshare on North Uist.
The coastguard said it was a Mirach 100/5. This type of drone is used by armed forces worldwide to train on weapons systems.
It was cordoned off before later being removed. The find came just days after the finish of a staging of Exercise Joint Warrior.
In 2007, a giant metal container appeared on a beach on the Western Isles.
It turned out that the 15m-long tank, similar to those used to ferment beer, was one of six lost overboard from a ship close to the south western approaches to the English Channel.
After being adrift at sea for three weeks, the container was found by a dog walker on Poll na Crann - known as Stinky Bay - on Benbecula.
The following year the crew of a yacht with an empty coffin strapped to the deck had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew after losing their way near the Western Isles.
RNLI volunteers from Barra were called out after the craft got lost on its passage from America to Norway.
The coffin was bound for a bar in Norway's capital, Oslo.

article Stephen Port, 41, is accused of four murders and seven rapes, which he denies.
The Old Bailey heard police found 83 home-made sex videos on Mr Port's mobile phone.
Prosecutors said six recordings show him engaged in sexual activity with the a man who appears to be unconscious.
Det Sgt Mick McInerney, who presented the evidence to the court, told jurors the same 24-year-old appears in all six videos, which were recorded between January and June last year.
Some of the videos featured other unidentified participants, the court heard.
Port, who watched intently from the dock, denies two sample counts of rape relating to two of the videos.
Mr Port, who worked as a chef, is on trial accused of murdering four young men by giving them fatal doses of date rape drug GHB over a 15-month period.
He is also accused of drugging and raping other young men he met through dating websites and lured to his one-bedroom flat in Barking, east London.
He denies 29 charges including four counts of murder, as well as drugging, rape and sexual assault.
The trial continues.

article It comes three-and-a-half years after industrial action led to a threat by Ineos to close the plant permanently.
A source at Ineos claimed on Friday that union officials at Grangemouth were "impossible to work with".
The union Unite accused the firm of being "reckless" over pay talks.
The union represents most staff at the Grangemouth chemicals plant.
Unite said members had unanimously rejected a pay offer from the company following a three-year pay freeze.
The union, which has been pressing for a 3.25% pay rise, said Ineos had offered a 2.8% increase for newer grades of staff and 1.4% - with a 1.4% lump sum - for staff with longer service.
The Ineos source told BBC Scotland that the company had also offered an additional bonus of up to 17%.
Unite described the move to end union agreements at Grangemouth as "an incredibly foolish attempt to undermine the democratic rights of workers" there.
Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: "After three years without a pay rise there is bound to be difficult negotiations, but Unite's demand for a 3.25% rise is more than reasonable and our intention remains to achieve a negotiated agreement.
"We would encourage Ineos to think again and to row back from what is an unnecessary act of aggression towards their own workforce."
The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, added: "If Ineos doesn't change its mind, we will simply go through the normal legal procedures, and push for an independent ballot of workers."
The source at Ineos said that the company worked well with unions at plants around the world, but it was dealing with the same people who led the union side at Grangemouth during the industrial dispute in 2014.
He added: "Trust has broken down. We had hoped for a constructive relationship with the new Unite, but it is the old Unite."
Ineos announced during the 2014 dispute that it would close the facility, with the loss of 800 jobs, but later reversed its decision after workers agreed to a survival plan which included a three-year pay freeze.
Pay talks between Ineos and unions at the nearby refinery are not affected by the latest developments.
summary Ineos has announced plans to close a plant in the Czech Republic.

article West Brom defender Craig Dawson scored the only goal of a breathless game from the penalty spot after Tottenham full-back Adam Smith was fouled in the box.
England could have won more comfortably but have the upper hand going into the second leg in Krusevac on Tuesday.
The only negative was a hamstring problem picked up by Jack Rodwell.
This was a seventh consecutive home win in a competitive match for England, equalling a record dating back more than 27 years. There was plenty of encouragement for Pearce against a Serbia team that had gone unbeaten in qualifying.
The performance of Raheem Sterling, on his debut at this level, was eye-catching. The Liverpool winger, with feet as sensitive as pick-pockets' hands, produced a bewildering repertoire of feints and swerves, sudden stops and demoralising spurts, turning and tormenting the Serbia defence time and again.
Blackpool's Tom Ince was equally impressive, without being able to apply a finish. With those two in his ranks, Pearce's side bristled with menace as England's wingers swapped places, eluded markers and dismantled Serbia's defensive system during a breathless and at times brutal opening period.
German referee Deniz Aytekin had shown three yellow cards by the seventh minute, as Serbia attempted to keep England's flyers in their blocks.
The best of England's early opportunities fell to Ince. The Blackpool winger combined well with Danny Rose in the 12th minute, only for the ball to skid off his forehead and beyond the far post with the goal at his mercy. A heavy first touch saw a second chance get away from Ince before a fizzing left-foot shot flashed narrowly wide.
England pushed for the breakthrough but with two clever, probing attacking surges Serbia served to remind everyone inside Carrow Road of their attacking potential.
Luka Milunovic might have done better when Darko Lazovic picked him out with a delightful cross from the right after a quickly-taken throw in. But despite being unmarked, the Red Star Belgrade striker got his header all wrong from six yards, before Sasa Markovic scuffed a shot wide from the edge of the box moments later.
Lazovic thumped a left-foot volley narrowly over for Serbia but it was England who made the brighter start to the second half. Sterling might have won a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area with another of his devastating surges but the referee allowed an advantage, which ultimately came to nothing.
The German official did blow his whistle soon after, however, as Adam Smith reacted first to a scrambled clearance of his initial cross to win a penalty for England after a mistimed challenge by Milunovic. Dawson made no mistake from the spot, his fifth goal in eight matches for Pearce's side.
Zaha should have doubled England's lead within two minutes as Ince burst down the left flank and found the Crystal Palace winger, whose left-foot shot flashed wide with the goal at his mercy. Then Steven Caulker was denied with eight minutes remaining as Serbia goalkeeper Branimir Aleksic produced a stunning save to turn his header away.
England U21 boss Stuart Pearce said: "We have won the game and kept a clean sheet, although we could have won it by more had we been more clinical in front of goal. Over there we will have more of an opportunity to break on them and use the pace we have. I would hope we would also be more clinical in front of goal."

article The Gulf airline is already a member of the Oneworld alliance.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he was delighted Qatar had become a "long-term supportive shareholder".
The stake, worth about √Ç¬£1.15bn, gives Qatar closer links with a group that has two major European hubs and strong transatlantic networks.
Mr Walsh said his company would explore what "opportunities exist to work more closely together and further IAG's ambitions as the leading global airline group".
Akbar Al Baker, chief executive of Qatar, said: "IAG represents an excellent opportunity to further develop our westwards strategy."
Earlier this month he criticised European airlines, saying they they "cannot keep up" with the competition posed by Gulf rivals.
The two groups' route networks are largely complementary, with Qatar strong in southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, while Iberia flies to many destinations in South America.
Qatar said it could increase its holding, but would be limited by the 49% cap on non-EU ownership of European airlines.
Neither group said whether IAG had been aware of Qatar's stake-building and did not say who the shares had been bought from, or when.
Qatar has more than 130 aircraft and a further 340 on order. It is competing with other Gulf airlines including Emirates, based in Dubai, and Abu Dhabi's Etihad.
The Doha-based carrier had 22m passengers in the 2013-14 financial year, compared with 44.5m for its larger rival Emirates. IAG carried just over 77m passengers in 2014.
Qatar's move comes as IAG attempts to complete a takeover of Aer Lingus for about √Ç¬£1.3bn.
The company has said it planned to run the Irish airline as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations.
IAG was formed when BA and Iberia merged in 2011. It has about 430 aircraft and 60,000 employees.
Shares in IAG closed down 3.5% at 544.5p on Friday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.
The stock has risen by more than a third in the past 12 months and the company is valued at √Ç¬£11.4bn.

article If you can't, you probably have that in common with roughly 99.999% recurring of the population.
Need a clue?
It includes the work of, among others, Delacroix, Ruskin, Sickert and Freud.
None the wiser? Maybe not. But better-informed.....
So here goes:
The Garman Ryan Collection comprises 365 paintings, drawings and sculptures donated to the people of Walsall in 1973 by Kathleen Garman, the widow of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, and his pupil Sally Garman, who had grown up in the Black Country.
For 26 long years this internationally-recognised collection was tucked away in the Reference Room of Walsall Library. But after a concerted campaign for it to be showcased in a setting befitting its importance, Walsall's purpose-built a New Art Gallery was opened, fanfares blaring, by the Queen in May 2000.
It had cost ¬£21 million of public money, mostly in the form of National Lottery grants.
In return came confident predictions that it would be the catalyst for an epic renewal of the town centre, embracing its canal basin, much in the  way that the rejuvenated Gas Street Basin had proved such a tonic for nearby Birmingham.
Walsall felt entitled to believe it was in good company: other towns and cities had tried and tested the concept of prestige cultural gambits in this civic equivalent of Bruce Forsyth's (Re)Generation Game. Down the road in West Bromwich, plans were well advanced for the ¬£72 million digital creative centre, 'The Public', which was to open, two years, late in 2008.
But what had seemed to be very much the vogue in the 'noughties met its reality check soon enough. In the roll call of casualties, the first, and still the most spectacular,  was 'The Public' itself, axed by Sandwell Council who could no longer justify the ¬£30,000 in subsidies each week in the face of dwindling visitor numbers.
It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to report that Walsall's magnificent gallery now faces the real possibility of going the same way.
After the financial crash has come the austerity "squeeze" on public spending. Our local authorities' vaulting ambitions have given way to the apparently unending grind of budgeting for the care of their  aging populations while making sure the bins still get emptied.
Walsall's Labour-controlled council proposes to axe its ¬£470,000 a year subsidy to the New Art Gallery. This would mean, in turn, that Arts Council England could no longer make good the loss, leaving the town's first major new public building  since its Victorian Town Hall facing the distinct threat of closure in four years' time.
"How can this be?" I asked myself when the realisation dawned.  I had bought wholesale into the grand vision of a 'cultural  treasure trove' which was bound to be a prime attraction for local people and would also bring arts aficionados flocking to the town with their wallets open.
I was even more surprised to discover in a recent article in 'The Sunday Times' (13th November 2016) by the BBC's former Arts Correspondent Rosie Millard that the gallery's annual visitor numbers, far from being  calculated in the millions I had expected, were actually running at a paltry 172,000 a year. Compare that with the new Library of Birmingham's 2.5 million visitors-a-year which puts it among  Britain's top ten attractions.
I realise I am being controversial when I say this, but maybe that's the difference between a mid-sized industrial town and one of the UK's most-visited cities outside London. Discuss!
This week's planned public protest in Walsall against the threatened funding cuts is a relatively rare rare display of public support for the New Gallery: one of my colleagues at BBC WM found it hard work to finding people at street level in the town who knew or cared much about it.
A prominent figure in the arts community told me privately: "It's a pity Walsall is not a tourist destination, and never will be: local people aren't bothered about the gallery and the people who are bothered don't go to Walsall".
Ouch!
If that's got your hackles rising, I hope you'll join us for this weekend's "Sunday Politics Midlands" when we'll have more on this.

article "Who woulda put a penny on me?"
Once Upon a Time in America, that gritty and at times extremely violent 1984 gangster film, is a favourite of 35-year-old Vyacheslav Senchenko.
"The movie makes sense to me," Senchenko told BBC Sport from his base in Donetsk.
"In it there is a true friendship and treachery. De Niro shows what a real man should be."
The rangy Ukrainian, a former WBA world welterweight belt holder, is aiming to spring from that starting gate and finish the night one of De Niro's winners, and real men, when he takes on Ricky Hatton in Manchester on 24 November.
"I'm sure that Ricky will be in very good form, and I expect a good fight," said Senchenko.
"I've seen Hatton's fights. He is a really strong boxer with an attacking manner - but I plan to conduct this fight in my own manner."
Once Upon a Time charts the rise then fall of De Niro's leading man, David 'Noodles' Aaronson. Towards the end we see an aged Noodles as a shadow of his former self.
The thousands inside Manchester Arena already know they will witness two fighters who, like Noodles at the finish, are closer to their ends than their beginnings.
Hatton has not thrown a punch in anger in years, while only Senchenko knows whether he bears any resemblance to the fighter whose record shows 32 wins from 33 contests, 21 by knockout.
The first and so far only defeat of his career came in his most recent bout in April, at the gloves of American Paulie Malignaggi, a 31-year-old whom Hatton himself beat in November 2008.
Malignaggi, the current WBA title holder, could well be a future target for the newly unretired Hatton. But in the build-up to his sold-out Manchester comeback, The Hitman spent much time emphasising the challenge posed by his immediate opponent.
"It sums me up - I'm straight in at the deep end against a former world champion in Senchenko," Hatton told the assembled media.
I've seen Hatton's fights. He is really strong boxer with an attacking manner
"He's probably the best opponent I could have picked. I've never gone for an easy opponent in my life and nothing's changed.
"Fighting him shows how serious I am. He's dangerous, but he's someone I can get my teeth into. I'm fighting him, and I won't let you down."
Much has been made of Hatton's quest for redemption since he announced his return to the ring after a three-year absence dogged by self-loathing and drug abuse.
But for Senchenko, who has only once fought outside his native Ukraine or neighbouring Russia, a high-profile win over Hatton on his opponent's turf would do wonders for his international profile.
"I'm not distracted by the fact Malignaggi lost to Hatton. I drew my own conclusions after my own defeat," he insisted.
"When I heard the news [of the Hatton fight] I was very glad - I am motivated by the possibility of fighting a strong and well-known rival, and now I want to become world champion once again."
However, many have dismissed Senchenko after his bloody defeat to Malignaggi.
Never the heaviest hitter, the New Yorker nonetheless triumphed in front of thousands inside the Donbass Arena with well-executed jabs - his punch landed 62% of the time and made a mess of the Ukrainian's left eye.
And the only Briton ever to have fought Senchenko, Wolverhampton fighter Stuart Elwell, told BBC Sport that a flurry of Hatton body shots and upper-cuts thrown at close range should do for his opponent.
"On paper Senchenko looks risky but the thing that struck me most when I fought him in Ukraine was despite the glossy record and world title he always looked scared and nervous. If that was the case for a home fight then when he enters the Manchester Arena and hears thousands of Brits screaming for his head I think the moment will fold him up like a beach chair. He's not bad but the atmosphere will bother him and Hatton should do the rest."
Paulie Malignaggi fought and beat Vyacheslav Senchenko in April 2012.
"To be honest, I think Ricky Hatton is the perfect fighter to beat him," said Elwell.
"[Senchenko] doesn't like being pushed back, and when I was pushing on to him he didn't seem to have any answers that a fighter of quality would have.
"Hatton is a pressure fighter and I don't think Senchenko will be able to deal with that. I predict Hatton inside six rounds."
Then, of course, there will be the unique experience of fighting in front of a vocal and highly partisan Hatton support. The comeback fight sold out a week after it was announced, even though no opponent had then been named.
Is Senchenko worried? "No. I've already boxed at Donbass Arena, which contains 50,000 people. I think that in Manchester the atmosphere will be approximately the same. His fans won't disturb me - I will be concentrating on the fight, and his supporters will be not a hindrance."
Hatton professes to be fighting fit and keen, but in Senchenko he faces a boxer whose pride, not to mention face, was hurt in his last bout.
Both men are veteran fighters who have given their lives to the sport. And both will be desperate for success in front of thousands in Manchester, if only to lend weight to another of De Niro's assertions in Sergio Leone's epic 80s drama: "It'd be a shame to see a lifetime of work go to waste."

article The controversial practice is based on the principle that "like cures like", but critics say patients are being given useless sugar pills.
The Faculty of Homeopathy said the therapy had "profound effects" and patients backed it.
A consultation is expected to take place in 2016.
The total NHS bill for homeopathy, including homeopathic hospitals and GP prescriptions, is thought to be about √Ç¬£4m.
Homeopathy is based on the concept that diluting a version of a substance that causes illness has healing properties.
So pollen or grass could be used to create a homeopathic hay-fever remedy.
One part of the substance is mixed with 99 parts of water or alcohol, and this is repeated six times in a "6c" formulation or 30 times in a "30c" formulation.
The end result is combined with a lactose (sugar) tablet.
Homeopaths say the more diluted it is, the greater the effect. Critics say patients are getting nothing but sugar.
Common homeopathic treatments are for asthma, ear infections, hay-fever, depression, stress, anxiety, allergy and arthritis.
Source: British Homeopathic Association
But the NHS itself says: "There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition."
The Good Thinking Society has been campaigning for homeopathy to be added to the NHS blacklist - known formally as Schedule 1 - of drugs that cannot be prescribed by GPs.
Drugs can be blacklisted if there are cheaper alternatives or if the medicine is not effective.
After the Good Thinking Society threatened to take their case to the courts, Department of Health legal advisers replied in emails that ministers had "decided to conduct a consultation".
Officials have now confirmed this will take place in 2016.
Simon Singh, the founder of the Good Thinking Society, said: "Given the finite resources of the NHS, any spending on homeopathy is utterly unjustifiable.
"The money spent on these disproven remedies can be far better spent on treatments that offer real benefits to patients."
But Dr Helen Beaumont, a GP and the president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, said other drugs such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for depression would be a better target for saving money, as homeopathic pills had a "profound effect" on patients.
She told the BBC News website: "Patient choice is important; homeopathy works, it's widely used by doctors in Europe, and patients who are treated by homeopathy are really convinced of its benefits, as am I."
The result of the consultation would affect GP prescribing, but not homeopathic hospitals which account for the bulk of the NHS money spent on homeopathy.
Estimates suggest GP prescriptions account for about √Ç¬£110,000 per year.
And any decision would not affect people buying the treatments over the counter or privately.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was criticised for supporting a parliamentary motion on homeopathy, but in an interview last year argued "when resources are tight we have to follow the evidence".
Minister for Life Sciences, George Freeman, told the BBC: "With rising health demands, we have a duty to make sure we spend NHS funds on the most effective treatments.
"We are currently considering whether or not homeopathic products should continue to be available through NHS prescriptions.
"We expect to consult on proposals in due course."

article Wills played companion Polly to William Hartnell's grandfatherly first Doctor and Patrick Troughton's scruffy second incarnation in 1966-67.
The show's producers decided to "regenerate" the lead role when Hartnell's health declined.
Saturday is the 50th anniversary of The Power of the Daleks, Troughton's debut.
The six-part adventure sees Troughton's time lord, and his Tardis companions, Polly and Ben (Michael Craze), do battle with the evil Daleks on the planet Vulcan.
To mark the anniversary, BBC Worldwide is releasing a black-and-white animated reconstruction of the "lost" story, based on surviving photographs and audio recordings.
Speaking at a screening of the first two episodes, Wills recalled how various actors - including Michael Horden and singer Tommy Steele - auditioned for the role of the new Doctor.
"We all knew Bill [William Hartnell] was going to leave at the end of the summer season, and then there were discussions about is that the end of the show or shall we have another actor," she said.
"When we heard it was Patrick, we knew that we had a chance.
"But we still didn't know if the audience would accept it and accept that the Doctor could change his body.
"And it was entirely up to Patrick that the audience did.
"In the animation you see how adorable he was, you couldn't resist him. And they didn't resist him.
"So luckily it was him and we're all here talking about it."
In this interview, Anneke Wills talks about about her memories of 1960s Doctor Who and what she think of Peter Capaldi's 12th Doctor.
This is the first time ever the Doctor changes his body.
For us at the time, it was a momentous moment.
Were we going to have a Bill Hartnell lookalike? Or someone totally different?
There were all these different names coming up. But also, as an actor, you were thinking: "I hope I'll be in work at the end of the summer break."
Bill had become very difficult to work with - we had to be very generous and kind and pick up his lines.
The thing about Patrick was that he had no ego. That was an astounding thing.
I think his performance in this story is the most astounding of all the Doctors - and I've watched them all.
We had two weeks of rehearsal so Patrick had extra time to get into the role.
He put on his Harpo Marx curly wig, and Michael Craze said: "If you're going to wear that, I'm not bloody working with you," and went off for a smoke.
I was worried we were wasting time, so I took a comb out of someone's pocket and combed his hair forward in a Beatles style and messed it up a bit.
There was a silence as Patrick looked in the mirror.
And then he said: "I like it."
We did that in those days. We never saw any of the work that we'd done. It was like rep theatre.  You'd do a wonderful performance and then it's gone.
Now, looking back, it seems a terrible waste.
I love that Polly and Ben have been brought back [in animated form] because there's so little of us that survives.
I would love it if they would do The Smugglers [a swashbuckling Troughton story from 1966], next I'd love to see The Crusade [a 1965 first Doctor adventure starring Julian Glover as Richard the Lionheart], and Fury of the Deep [a second Doctor sea-monster story from 1968].
Wouldn't it be wonderful? I don't know any more than the fans. They always think that I've got secrets, but I haven't .
If anybody's got one in their cupboard bring it forth - now is the moment.
Someone should make a spy thriller about the search for the missing episodes of Doctor Who.
Polly was created as a proactive young woman and, in a way, that hasn't changed. However, I take exception when the companion slaps the Doctor. That makes me really angry.
That scares me to bits. All these wrinkles in high definition? I don't think so.
I talked to Peter Capaldi. I think he's astounding. He's luminous.
He asked me if there was a lot of pressure in the 1960s and I said we'd start rehearsals on a Monday, and he said: "You rehearse?"
Yes. Of course I'd take on the challenge. Maybe I could be in a wonderful mask.

article More than 240 people have died and at least 368 were injured, officials said.
Many people are still believed to be buried under rubble and more than 4,300 rescuers are using heavy lifting equipment and bare hands to find them.
Many of the victims were children, the health minister said, and there were warnings the toll could rise further.
Early on Thursday, Italy's civil protection authorities said a total of 247 people were now known to have died, with 190 deaths reported in Rieti province and 57 in neighbouring Ascoli Piceno province.
Rescuers said they had pulled five bodies from the ruins of the Hotel Roma in the historic town of Amatrice. Officials said about 35 people had been staying at the hotel and most had managed to get out. About 10 people were still unaccounted for, a local fire official said.
Late on Wednesday there were cheers in the village of Pescara del Tronto when a young girl was pulled alive from the rubble after being trapped for 17 hours. Almost all the houses there had collapsed, the mayor said.
The 6.2-magnitude quake hit at 03:36 (01:36 GMT) on Wednesday 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome.
Hardest hit were the small towns and villages in the mountainous area where the regions of Umbria, Lazio and Le Marche meet.
People there spent the night outside or in tents provided by the emergency services.
Among the victims was an 18-month-old toddler, Marisol Piermarini, whose mother Martina Turco survived the deadly 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila and moved away from there after the experience, Italian news agency Ansa reported.
Ms Turco was being treated in hospital after being pulled from the rubble in the village of Arquata del Tronto, Ansa said.
The area has also been shaken by strong aftershocks, including a 4.7-magnitude tremor with its epicentre about 7km east of Norcia, according to the US Geological Survey.
The mayor of Amatrice said three-quarters of the town had been destroyed and no building was safe for habitation.
Many of those affected were on holiday in the region. Some were in Amatrice for a festival to celebrate a famous local speciality - amatriciana bacon and tomato sauce.
The country is no stranger to earthquakes: the 2009 L'Aquila tremor killed more than 300 people and in May 2012 two tremors nine days apart killed more than 20 people in the northern Emilia Romagna region.
Earthquakes are an ever-present danger for those who live along the Apennine mountain range in Italy.
Through the centuries thousands have died as a result of tremors equal to, or not much bigger than, the event that struck in the early hours of Wednesday. The modern response, thankfully, has been more robust building and better preparation.
Mediterranean seismicity is driven by the great collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates; but when it comes down to the specifics of this latest quake, the details are far more complicated.
The Tyrrhenian Basin, or Sea, which lies to the west of Italy, between the mainland and Sardinia/Corsica, is slowly opening up.
Scientists say this is contributing to extension, or "pull-apart", along the Apennines.  This stress is compounded by movement in the east, in the Adriatic.
The result is a major fault system that runs the length of the mountain range with a series of smaller faults that fan off to the sides. The foundations of cities like Perugia and L'Aquila stand on top of it all.

article The troops died in "unprovoked" firing overnight in the Bhimber sector on the Line of Control (LoC). India blamed Pakistan for starting the clash.
It is thought to be the Pakistani military's biggest single loss of life in Kashmir since a 2003 truce.
Tensions have flared over the long-running dispute since an Indian army base was attacked in September.
Both India and Pakistan accuse each other of violating the 2003 ceasefire agreement.
Both sides have reported civilians and a number of soldiers being killed or injured in recent weeks, during which time the LoC has seen intense exchanges of fire.
Hundreds of civilians in villages along the LoC have been evacuated.
Did India really "surgically strike" Kashmir militants?

What is Kashmir?
The teenager blinded by pellets in Indian Kashmir
The territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Muslim-majority Kashmir has been running for decades.
Both nuclear-armed states claim the territory in its entirety but control only parts of it. Two of the three wars fought between the two sides since independence have been over Kashmir.
After the 18 September army base attack on the Indian-administered side, the Indian military said it had carried out "surgical strikes" against suspected militants along the LoC.
Pakistan called the strikes an "illusion" and denied Indian claims it was behind the militant attack.
A subsequent BBC investigation found that while India did not airdrop commandos to hit militant camps or conduct ground assaults deep into Pakistani-administered territory, troops did cross the LoC a significant distance to hit border posts and then pulled back.
Pakistan said two soldiers were killed in the strikes. Two more are reported to have died in cross-border firing since.

article Moray Council has granted Elgin Energy planning permission for a 20MW project near Urquhart, which could see about 80,000 solar panels installed.
The farm will be constructed on the 47-hectare Speyslaw site - the equivalent of about 40 football pitches.
The largest Scottish solar farm is currently a 13MW project at Errol Estate in Perthshire, which went live in May last year.
Bristol-based Elgin Energy also developed that scheme, which includes 55,000 solar panels capable of generating power for more than 3,500 homes,.
A date for the start of the project has yet to be set.
The project will include a substation, 20 inverter stations and a CCTV camera system.
All cabling at the site - spread over three fields at the Innes Estate - will be underground, allowing sheep to graze around the panels.
Permission for the solar farm is valid for 30 years, after which the developer will have one year to decommission the works and restore the site to a condition agreed with the council.
A habitat management plan must also be approved by the council before works can begin.
In a statement, Elgin Energy said: "Existing field boundaries will not be disturbed and mature hedgerows will provide generous screening for the site.
"Elgin Energy has contacted those neighbours in the immediate vicinity of the site and has offered to answer any queries which might arise.
"The land will remain in agricultural use in the form of sheep grazing while being used for the dual purpose of generating low-carbon renewable energy."
Councillor Claire Feaver, chairwoman of Moray Council's Planning and Regulatory Services Committee, said: "A significant amount of renewable energy will be generated by this solar farm over the next 30 years.
"The opportunity to continue grazing on the land, together with the habitat management plan, will maintain and enhance the diverse range of species in and around the site.
"I see this as a win-win."
Scottish Renewables welcomed news that the Speyslaw project had been given the go-ahead.
Policy manager Stephanie Clark said: "Large-scale solar has played a part in Scotland since 2005 and we are now beginning to see more applications for commercial projects coming forward.
"North east Scotland's clear skies and longer daylight hours mean the area is attractive to developers.
"Large schemes like this one are able to use that resource to provide clean electricity which will help Scotland meet its climate change targets.
"Further progress in the solar sector, however, depends on the level of support provided by the UK government through the Feed-in Tariff and the Contracts for Difference schemes, both of which remain the subject of much uncertainty."
Elgin Energy, which has already developed 250MW of solar across 24 projects in the UK and Ireland, is planning an even bigger farm in Moray.
It is seeking planning permission for a 50MW project at the former RAF Milltown airfield, a few miles north east of Elgin.
A decision on that application is not expected until early next year.

article The event is part of an art exhibition at the 20-21 Visual Arts Centre, which began on Saturday 18 February.
To find and keep the pieces, worth at least √Ç¬£1,000 each, people must study five paintings and solve the code within them.
One of the items was found by accident so a reward is being offered to anyone who can solve the clue linked to it.
Artist Luke Jerram said he would donate √Ç¬£500 to a charity of the finder's choice if they could solve the mystery of the "red picture".
The fourth item, the golden train, was found by a family from Grimsby in Scunthorpe's Central Park on Friday night.
Mr Jerram said he had not anticipated so many items would be discovered in the first week.
"I was expecting two or three, something like that. What I did not expect was the response of the public would be so astonishingly positive.
"I did not expect the public would go round looking in every nook and cranny of the town to try and find the artefacts."
The Visual Arts Centre said the public response had been extraordinary.
"It has created a real buzz around the place and brought in thousands of people," said the centre's visual arts officer Michelle Lally.
The final item to be found is the gold copy of a Jurassic ammonite, an ancient marine mollusc fossil.
The five objects are replicas of pieces at North Lincolnshire Museum and were made from gold worth √Ç¬£1,000, but could be worth much more.

article The trade union Unite says that the shop floor jobs are to go from the firm's "complementary labour force".
That part of the workforce is made up from temporary and contract workers and tends to fluctuate depending on demand.
The company confirmed that up to 130 contract workers are being let go and described it as "regrettable".
Last year, Bombardier cut 300 temporary and contract jobs and made 90 people redundant from the permanent workforce.
The aerospace company is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers.
About 5,000 permanent employees and about 1,000 temporary and contract staff work at its Belfast base.
In a statement, Bombardier said "the need to be competitive" meant the company had to make adjustments to its staffing levels.
Bombardier has had a difficult few years with the development of its C Series plane badly delayed and a business jet project suspended.
That has been reflected in its Northern Ireland workforce - Tuesday's announcement brings the number of job losses to more than 500 in six months.
Last week, the Canadian firm appointed a new chief executive in an attempt to find a way out of the current problems.
The new man, Alain Bellemare, needs to convince more airlines to buy the C Series, an aircraft which has cost more than $5bn to develop.
"Our manpower situation is kept under constant review.  We have reviewed our latest requirements based on current customer demand," the firm said.
"Up until mid-2014, we had increased our complementary labour force by over 1,000 positions, but lately we have had to reduce this level."
A spokesman for the union Unite said the cuts were "another savage blow" to the company's workforce.
Regional coordinating officer Davy Thompson said: "This announcement highlights the inadequacy of existing employment protection, in particular for that afforded to agency workers who are making up more and more of the Northern Ireland labour force.
"There's a need for Stormont politicians to get serious on action to improve job security protections for workers, particularly within the manufacturing sector where there is a real risk of de-skilling."

article A Dara McVeety goal in the 25th-minute helped Terry Hyland's men establish a 1-9 to 0-7 half-time lead.
Martin Reilly converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half after Cian Mackey had been brought down.
Armagh had a chance to cut their deficit to three but Stefan Campbell's weak penalty was saved by home goalkeeper Raymond Galligan.
Seanie Johnston, up against his former boss at Kildare Kieran McGeeney, landed seven points and was one of Cavan's eight scorers on the day.
Just three players were on target for the Orange County and in the end they fell well short.
Armagh played an outfield man in goals, Ballyhegan club man Paul Courtney making his Championship debut.
He was unable to keep out Reilly's penalty while, soon afterwards, his opposite number Raymond Galligan saved Campbell's poorly directed effort.
Armagh made a decent enough start, scoring three of the first four points.
But five unanswered scores - three of them from Johnston - saw things swing the way of the favourites, and there were seven points in it when Reilly advanced to feed McVeety who netted from close-range.
Tony Kernan and Ethan Rafferty got the last two scores of the half, but Armagh still trailed by five at the break.
It looked all over when Reilly's penalty made it 2-11 to 0-9, but Armagh had a great chance to ignite the contest when Killian Clarke's foul on Campbell resulted in a penalty.
However, Campbell's kick was too close to Galligan who saved and Cavan went straight up the pitch to go 2-13 to 0-12 up through Johnston. Then, it really was over.

article Adilson Tavares Varela, known as Cabral, told Hull Crown Court he had consensual sex with the 22-year-old woman at his flat in Gateshead.
The ex-Sunderland midfielder denied being "persistent, forceful and aggressive" and said he stopped having sex with her when she asked him to.
He denies two counts of rape.
The woman has told the jury Varela pinned her down on his bed and raped her after they met during a night out in Newcastle.
But the footballer said they kissed and danced together before going back to his home with friends, including retired French international Anthony Reveillere.
He said the woman asked him to go into the bedroom.
When asked about her behaviour, Varela said: "It was normal. It was a normal girl who wanted to have sex with me.
"It seemed to me she was used to doing this as she was in no way ashamed."
He told the court he removed all of his clothes except for his socks and that he and the woman had sex in two positions.
Speaking through an interpreter, Cape Verde-born Varela told the jury the woman asked him to stop after around 15 minutes because she was tired.
He said he stopped and swore at her in French because he felt "frustrated".
Varela, who has a fiancee and a three-year-old son who live in Switzerland, told the court he got dressed and returned to the others in the living room, where he sent a message to a woman he described as a "sex buddy".
He said the complainant later left his flat with the others and was upset because she thought her mother would be angry with her.
Varela now plays for Swiss team FC Zurich. The trial continues.

article It follows a National Audit Office (NAO) report, which revealed that the rollout will cost at least ¬£92m less than BT had originally said.
The government said that the spare cash would be ploughed back into offering fast broadband to more remote areas.
BT said that the  claim - made by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - was "bizarre".
PAC told the BBC it questioned why BT had told the committee it would cost so much more.
"Although it's reassuring that the cost to the public purse could end up being ¬£92m (25%) less than what BT had originally forecast in its bid, I worry that this does not stack up with what BT told my committee in 2013 - that it factors in a contingency of between 5% and 8%, which might not get spent, a much smaller proportion than 25%," Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC, told the BBC.
"It is very concerning that it looks like BT could have abused its dominant position in the market by vastly overestimating forecast costs in the first place when it put in its original bid, and we also have broader concerns about whether the deal represents value for money."
In response BT said that its initial cost estimates were "based on our initial view of how much it would cost to deploy fibre in rural areas".
"We have come in under budget in several areas which is good news for the taxpayer as we only charge for the costs we incur, not those we first forecast. The savings can now be reinvested to take fibre to additional areas."
"The suggestion we inflated those costs is bizarre as by doing so we would have hindered our chances of winning the work."
"The NAO report this week confirmed our costs were 20% below those others would have charged in a sample area, so we are clearly delivering excellent value for money."
The distribution of broadband is overseen by Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK), part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).
The report found "significantly lower" costs than listed in BT's financial model for the first phase of the scheme.
"As at September 2014, BT's total reported capital spend on phase 1 of the programme was ¬£142 million (38%) under the estimated price, including work in progress not yet invoiced," the NAO said.
Taking into account possible further costs, BT would still have spent "approximately ¬£92m less", the report concludes.
This sum will be ploughed back into rural rollouts, the DCMS said.
"The savings realised so far, along with with projected future savings, will be reinvested in extending the current rollout plans."
Several reports have found that rural businesses, schools and homes are at a significant disadvantage because of poor broadband.
Bringing faster services to remote areas has proved to be highly controversial.
Questions have been raised about the time it has taken the government to start the rollout and whether the plans are ambitious enough.
Last year the Public Accounts Committee accused the government of mismanaging the project, and said BT released "wildly inaccurate" estimates of costs.
Mrs Hodge said at the time: "The taxpayer has been ripped off, with ¬£1.2bn going to the shareholders of BT."
BT's status as the only operator providing rural broadband could actually be one of the reasons for costs being cut, said Andrew Ferguson, editor of the ThinkBroadband news site.
"It is interesting that a chunk of the savings are down to the fact that only one supplier won all the contracts, increasing the economies of scale, at the expense of competition," he said.
Mike Kiely, a former adviser to BDUK, has long argued that BT's estimates of the cost of distributing broadband to rural areas were far too high.
He felt vindicated by the findings, saying: "Thirty-eight per cent excess costs have been confirmed in the cost models used to calculate the milestone payments.  Those monies - and there will be more - need to be used to extend the fibre rollout further."
He and others argue that BT should think about offering even faster broadband - by taking so-called "fibre-to-the-premise" technology, which offers significantly higher speeds than BT's preferred technology of "fibre-to-the-cabinet".
BT hopes to deliver speeds of up to 500Mbps (megabits per second) to homes via an innovative technology known as G.fast.
"We believe G.fast is the key to unlocking ultrafast speeds and we are prepared to upgrade large parts of our network should the pilots prove successful," chief executive Gavin Patterson said.
The firm expects to offer initial speeds of a few hundred megabits per second to millions of homes and businesses by 2020.

And while the players regroup in the dressing room at half time, the Greenmount students will be making running repairs to the grass to keep the stars safe.
It's all down to their tutor who entered them as a team in a professional green-keeping skills competition, which they won.
"The prize is an all-expenses trip to Wembley to the FA Cup final to see how exactly the pitch is maintained and how it's looked after and what goes into the preparations for a final," said Gavin White, who is a Horticulture foundation degree student.
And as first year Sports Turf student Michael Dundee explained, they will also get to take over the pitch at half-time and after the match.
"At half-time we'll go out with the forks to repair the divots and then again help the team to repair the pitch and clear up the pitch ready for the play-off games on Sunday," he said.
The four students are all at different stages of learning, but they pulled together for the opportunity to brush shoulders with the likes of Cech, Costa, Sanchez and Ozil.
For Level-3 Sports Turf student John Kennedy, it's a professional dream.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to see a stadium maintained at such a high standard," he said.
But for football fan and Level Three ground-keeping student Jon Crawford, it's the trip of a lifetime.
"It's pretty exciting that it's Chelsea in the final, being a massive Chelsea fan," he said.
"After such a good season it's nice to be able to see them and especially to go to Wembley to do it as well."
He will also be hoping to grab a little taste of the limelight for himself.
"I'll just go out on the pitch and maybe swing my arms about so people can see me on TV or something," he laughed.
But there'll be no time for celebrating at the end of the match.
The four will be hard at it with the Wembley ground-keeping team, repairing the pitch for the play-offs the next day.
summary It's been a dream of a long time for farmers in the Republic of Ireland.

article With five tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen.
Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents.
Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports.
Emmanuel, 18, said they had "not been told anything".
"I'm angry to an extent that they didn't tell us sooner."
During live broadcasts, one woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: "Can you tell me what's going on?"
There was a steady trickle of families walking out of Taplow with an array of suitcases, satchels and bags for life.
An elderly man called George, wearing a suit and carrying a small duffle bag, was trying to re-enter the complex.
His neighbour shouted: "They'll only kick you out again George. Your best bet is to go back to the leisure centre."
George - like many other residents - did not want to speak to the media.
Many residents were sent to the Swiss Cottage leisure centre, to learn where their temporary accommodation would be.
Some people said that - despite the evacuation - they wanted to stay at home.
By 21:00 BST, council employees were going floor-by-floor to tell residents who did not know about the evacuation.
Brian, who lives on the fifth floor of Taplow tower, said: "It's a weird time to kick people out, especially as it's most children's bedtime."
Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq said: "I realise it's disruptive to people's lives but constituents safety comes first.
"If it's not safe then people need to go."
The Labour MP said it was a "tough decision" for Camden Council to make, but added: "This building is not safe for our residents.
"Our council could not let residents stay overnight."
Edward Strange was travelling to Salisbury with his family when news broke on the radio. They turned back immediately to find out what was going on.
He said that the evacuation was a "complete overreaction", adding that two previous fires in Taplow were "easily contained".
He intended to stay with friends for the first night, but said he could not impose his family on them for much longer.
Camden Council has said the works could take up to four weeks.
The number of residents being evacuated from the 800 homes is unknown, but it could be in the thousands.
Ms Siddiq said that the council had block-booked hotel rooms and were offering them to all residents.
Four miles from the Chalcots estate stands the charred remains of Grenfell Tower.
At least 79 people are feared dead after a fire engulfed the 24-storey building earlier this month.
Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said: "I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything."
Louise Simons, who lives in nearby Primrose Hill, came to the tower blocks to offer any displaced residents a spare bed for the evening.
"We live locally and have been impacted by the events of Grenfell," she said. "Obviously we wanted to help."

article Maamria, 44, took charge in November after former manager Paul Carden left by mutual consent.
The Sandgrounders are without a win in their last five home games and let a 3-0 lead slip in Saturday's 3-3 draw with struggling Welling United.
They are 17th in the table, but eight points above the relegation zone with eight games left to play.
In his final interview prior to his departure, Maamria said his side needed to lose their uncertainty if they were to improve their inconsistent league form.
"For some reason the team at home are very hesitant and I've got to find out why," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"That's been happening before my time here and we need to get to the bottom of it to give the players confidence."
After winning four consecutive home matches following his appointment in November, Southport are yet to win at Haig Avenue since the beginning of January.
"Ranting is going to get you nowhere because these are the players I inherited and I've got to work with them at least until the end of the season," Maamria added.
"From day one I said I don't really get sucked into the table too much because you end up losing focus on the next game."
summary Wales manager David Maamria has been sacked by the club.

article Doune Castle, near Stirling, is portrayed as the fictional Castle Leoch, the seat of Clan MacKenzie.
It also featured as Camelot in the film Monty Python and The Holy Grail and in the pilot episode of Game of Thrones.
Historic Scotland figures show year-on-year visitor numbers to the castle have grown by 30.2% to 49,553 in 2014/15.
The TV series follows the story of Claire Randell, a nurse from 1946 who is swept back in time to 1743.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Doune Castle is just the latest location to report the 'Outlander effect'.
"From Dumfries to Inverness, historic visitor attractions are reporting a rise in visitor numbers thanks to the popularity of the TV show and renewed interest in the novels.
"Canada, the USA and Australia, where the series is shown, all have a shared history with Scotland, and Outlander is a great introduction to our must-visit country.
"We hope that visitor numbers increase further as viewers in the UK and Germany get to enjoy the programme."
Outlander is based on novels by US author Diana Gabaldon.
Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, said: "Scotland is the land that inspired Outlander and our locations map has already proved a big hit with visitors with many making the journey to stunning locations within the series such as Doune Castle.
"Furthermore, we are seeing more and more tourism businesses, including accommodation providers and visitor attractions, looking at ways in which they can capitalise on the show."
Ms Hyslop will travel to New York and Los Angeles for Scotland Week, attending a series of business, tourism, cultural and film industry engagements.

article Sanderson proved unplayable with a fine display of swing bowling to earn the visitors their first Championship win of the season.
Set 347 to win, Glamorgan slipped to 12-4 and never showed the application to survive as they were all out for 95.
Sanderson also picked up 10 wickets in a match for the first time.
Northants might have won even sooner if they had not dropped a series of slip catches.
Only three players reached double figures, Mark Wallace with a gritty 28 not out and Aneurin Donald the joint top-scorers, while there were four ducks in a miserable home display in the Swansea sunshine.
A Championship-best 5-61 from Timm van der Gugten was the sole high point of the final day for Glamorgan, whose seamer Ruaidhri Smith will miss four to six weeks with a side strain.
Both sides are involved in T20 Blast quarter-finals with Northants taking on Middlesex on Tuesday, 9 August and Glamorgan facing Yorkshire on Thursday, 11 August.
Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport:
"I thought the pitch seamed around quite a lot today and their boys bowled really well today, straight, really accurately and consistently- every good ball we edged, or it broke our defences so it was a perfect storm.
"We are disappointed but we knew we'd rested a few players, we knew there was a risk, but we've also learned about some young players.
"It was exciting to see young debutant Lukas Carey doing well and Nick Selman with a fantastic hundred.
"We've lost this game but we've had an opportunity to rest some players (for the T20) who hopefully will be fresh for Thursday, and to see what some of our younger players have."
Northants bowler Ben Sanderson told BBC Radio Northampton:
"I felt really good, just ran in and seemed to do the right things, hit the right areas and it's easy on days like that.
"Conditions weren't helping with the sunshine so we worked really hard on the ball and kept it in good condition, credit to the boys.
"To come here and get the wickets is brilliant for me, a real confidence-booster, and we've put in a performance that should carry us on for the rest of the season.

Tiens Group president Li Jinyuan booked up 140 hotels in Paris and more than 4,700 rooms in Cannes and Monaco for their trip.
Their holiday included a private viewing of the Louvre museum and a mass visit to the Moulin Rouge cabaret show.
On Friday, Guinness World Records' inspectors watched the group line up on a beach to break the record for the longest "human-made phrase".
Local media say that the group is expected to spend some √¢‚Äö¬¨13m ($14.6m; √Ç¬£9.5m) in total.
"We have mobilised public services as well as tourism professionals, hotels, restaurants, shops and designer brands," said Christian Mantel, head of tourism development agency Atout France.
"So far everything has gone smoothly, the feedback has been extremely positive," he said, as quoted by the Agence France-Presse news agency.
The tourists have hired 146 buses to drive them around for the duration of their holiday.

It said the policy would give the average public sector worker a pay rise of √Ç¬£779.
But the Conservatives said only they could deliver "strong public services".
Under Tory government policy, a 1% pay cap for public sector workers is in place in a bid to "protect jobs and repair the finances".
Labour's leaked draft manifesto included plans to end the cap, and the Lib Dems said they would bring an end to "years of pitiful increases" by increasing wages in line with the Consumer Price Index, which was 2.3%, according to the latest figures.
"Our NHS and schools are already struggling to recruit the staff they need," said former Business Secretary Vince Cable.
"A better future is available. We will stand up for our schools and hospitals and give hard-working nurses, teachers and police the pay rise they deserve."

A spokesman for the fire service said: "Teams in breathing apparatus entered the property to search for anyone inside and sadly they located a woman who had died.
"Firefighting operations were conducted both inside and outside the house and the fire was brought under control, however due to a partial structural collapse it is likely to be some time before crews can confirm it has been fully extinguished."

article The Sloan Digital Sky Survey's latest effort tops its own record, published publicly for professional astronomers and "citizen scientists" alike.
Data from Sloan has helped to identify hundreds of millions of cosmic objects.
The release was announced at the 217th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, US.
Researchers have released  an animation on YouTube demonstrating how the incredibly high-resolution image is represented on the celestial sphere.
Michael Blanton, a New York University physicist who presented the work on behalf of the Sloan team, told the conference that it was difficult to overstate the breadth of data Sloan provided.
"There's something like 3,500 papers that have been written on the basis of this data set," he said.
"A few dozen of them are being presented right now, this week at this meeting. They cover topics from the very smallest stars to the most massive black holes in the universe."
Nearly half a billion stars and galaxies have already been discovered and described thanks to Sloan images, and the new release is sure to significantly increase that number.
Sloan data is also behind the Google Sky service, which allows users to scan the heavens in the same way as scanning their local streets, and the Galaxy Zoo project, which has allowed astronomy enthusiasts to characterise galaxies from their own computers.
The workhorse behind the data set, a camera comprising 125 million pixels that long held the record for highest-resolution camera in the world, has been retired.
Studies will now focus on spectrometry - unpicking new data on the basis of the colours of light that the upgraded equipment can detect.
They include:
But even the data that is already available, thanks to Tuesday's release, will keep astronomers of both the professional and the amateur variety busy.
"You can compare it to the National Geographic Palomar Survey of the late 1950s," Dr Blanton said.
"This is something that 50 years later is still a really important reference to astronomers; we use it ourselves to better understand our own images. SDSS is the digital version of that."

article David Jones told a House of Lords committee the UK's negotiating position may not be "totally crystallised" by next spring.
Mr Jones said the government was at an early stage of the process and that thinking was "developing".
Theresa May has said Article 50 will be triggered by the end of March 2017.
This will put in process formal talks with the EU, which will last for up to two years before Brexit happens.
Mr Jones, a minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, was appearing before the EU Home Affairs sub-committee, which is investigating the security implications of Brexit.
He was questioned on what government departments hoped to get out of any eventual agreement with the EU.
Mr Jones said: "We wish to proceed at a pretty brisk pace, because clearly the work of my department covers the entirety of government.
"We would like to see our negotiating position, if not totally crystallised, at least worked up to a very high level by the time that Article 50 is finally triggered, so an early report from this committee would be very much appreciated."
Later, Mr Jones responded to a question from Conservative peer Lord Cormack, repeating the assertion.
He said: "I have to say, in all frankness, and I don't think you will be surprised if I do say this, we are at a relatively early stage of this process.
"Our thinking is developing and we are looking, as I said earlier, to have if not precisely crystallised at least a very highly developed position by the time we serve our Article 50 notice."
UK voters opted in favour of leaving the EU by 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum in June.
Several MPs have urged a parliamentary vote on what the government's position is before negotiations with the EU begin.
But the government says this is constitutionally unnecessary and could undermine its bargaining power as issues including access to the European single market and migration controls are discussed.

article Conte is close to winning the title in his first season in English football.
His side can move seven points clear with three games left if they beat Middlesbrough on Monday (20:00 BST).
"I think Tottenham have an advantage, if you compare Tottenham to Chelsea," said the Italian.
"This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Mauricio Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players and is working very well.
"For me, Tottenham are a really strong team and it's normal to see them fighting for the title."
Conte believes Spurs, who were Leicester City's main challengers in 2015-16 before fading to finish third, would have easily won the Premier League this season if it were not for his side's impressive season.
"In this season, if Chelsea had not performed in this way, Tottenham would win the title without difficulty," he said.
"Only this great season from us is pushing them to fight and, maybe, to win or not to win the title."
The former Juventus and Italy boss could lead his side to a league and FA Cup double, 10 months after Chelsea finished 10th, with an FA Cup final against Arsenal on 27 May.
Unlike some of their rivals, Chelsea have not been involved in Europe and Conte thinks it is difficult for English clubs to succeed in the Champions League because of the strength of the Premier League.
In the past six years, five English clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, compared to 17 from Spain and 10 in Germany.
Conte said: "This league is very difficult. Every single game you must fight a lot and, I think, also for this reason it's not easy to arrive at the end of a European competition.
"It is so clear here, every season will be tougher and tougher to qualify for the Champions League."

article The deal marks the latest initiative in China's keen pursuit of overseas high-speed rail deals.
Analysts say the project could open up the underdeveloped US high-speed rail market.
There are about a dozen high-speed rail projects in the US, but they have struggled to gain traction.
Private rail venture XpressWest will form a joint venture with China Railway International USA.
The firm is owned by a consortium made up of subsidiaries from state firms China Railway Group, CRRC, China State Construction Engineering Corporation and China Railway Signal & Communication Corporation.
Guotai Junan analyst Gary Wong estimated the XpressWest project was worth $5bn.
He said the deal would offer little financial benefit to China Railway International USA, but could help give the firm a foothold in the US high-speed rail market.
"If this opens up the United States market for them, opportunities for future expansion will increase. And if [their technology] is used in the United States, it will be easier for them to sell to other countries," he said.

article The pair could hardly be separated going into the final two fences but jockey Tom Scudamore guided Vieux Lion Rouge home.
The eight-year-old was seventh in last year's Grand National.
Cue Card continued on his way towards the Gold Cup at Ascot with his ninth Grade One triumph in the Ascot Chase.
BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Vieux Lion Rouge is the new favourite for the Grand National after success over fellow big-race hopeful Blaklion.
The win means that Tom Scudamore is now due to ride the favourite for both the Aintree feature and for jump racing's number one prize, the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in which he rides Thistlecrack on 17 March.
Blaklion also advertised his National credentials as - for the first time in 20-odd years - ground conditions were decent (good to soft) for this fixture, so it was not the usual gut-wrenching slog.
The best two horses, both of whom have attractive weights in the 10 stones at Aintree, excelled, showing off their jumping ability and stamina in style. They will be big players on 8 April.

article He posted a video online saying too much money was spent on defence and it should go to the NHS instead.
New submarines carrying nuclear weapons are being designed at BAE Systems in Barrow, Cumbria.
Barrow Labour MP John Woodcock said he would rather be protected by a nuclear deterrent than an "eccentric comedian".
In his own online video he said: "This is a substantial investment, but the overall majority of this goes on employing the many thousands of the most highly-skilled engineers and manufacturers.
"I want us to have more to be able to defend this country than a sharp-witted, eccentric comedian.
"Come to Barrow and meet some of this workforce. Let's do this thing properly."
Brand had asked how the country could have a "properly-funded NHS".
"Is it at the expense of the arms industry? The answer is obviously yes," he said.
"As the NHS struggles against a ¬£2bn funding gap this year the money diverted into Trident - ¬£3.3bn being spent in the assessment phase, not to mention the ¬£2-3bn we spend every year just running our current Trident system - reflects the choice our government has made."
He appeared to be quoting a New Statesman article by Kate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in part of what he said.
Brand was unavailable for comment on Mr Woodcock's remarks and BAE declined to comment.
The firm's Barrow shipyard employs about 6,900 people. Around 1,400 of those are currently working on the Successor submarine replacement programme.
The government has put the cost of replacing Trident at ¬£15-20bn, but campaigners have argued it will cost at least ¬£34bn.
The replacement submarines are expected to come into operation in 2028.

article A growing and ageing population means more of us live with, or will one day need, care for long-term illnesses.
But are we - and that includes me - looking at health too much in terms of just how the NHS is operating?
Well, research suggests healthcare may in fact contribute as little as 10% towards the health and well-being of a country's population.
Or put it in another way: while the pressures on frontline services may dominate the news, the actual impact of those services to our health overall is actually relatively small.
Much more important, arguably, are things like the quality of our homes and the environment around us.
BETTER HOUSING IS A CORNERSTONE
Stuart Ropke, chief executive of Community Housing Cymru
"When the nation talks about health, inevitably the focus is always on acute services - A&E, admission to hospital, quality of GP services - which are of course really important, but for me there are obvious building blocks which need to be in place so people don't reach that stage.
"For me, housing is the keystone of good health. At the very basic level, the fabric of the home providing warmth and protection from the elements but also the community where people live is really important to their well being.
"It's not just about delivering physical homes on the ground but ensuring the people living there are healthy, active and being supported."
So how do you do that?
On the site of the old Ely paper mill in Cardiff, 800 new homes will soon be built.
But the boss of the company responsible for this site tells me the √Ç¬£100m project is quite different to things done in the past, where developers tended to build homes, sell them and move on.
David Ward, chief executive of Tirion Group
"Fifty percent of this housing will be affordable homes and we're going to be here for 50 years, managing these homes. It's important we get the quality right for people renting. So from a public health point of view, we're offering good quality, well-managed homes, at a price people can afford."
A community engagement team will be working on projects with residents which range from the design of a riverside park to healthy living initiatives.
"We're looking at the allotments on the other side of the river and whether there's something we can do with the local community in delivering a food project and we're finishing the missing link of the Ely Trail which will connect all the way from Cardiff Bay to St Fagan's, which people cans use for walking, running and cycling but will also mean a commuter route to the centre of Cardiff."
PREVENTING BAD HEALTH AND A CULTURAL SHIFT IN THE PART WE ALL PLAY
But it is about much more than just housing, all public services have a part to play in trying to make sure we and future generations the best chance to be healthy and happy and prosperous.
But how do you get them all working together to achieve that goal?
Last year, a new law was passed in Wales - the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act - with the aim of doing just that. It was described as a world first.
The woman, charged with driving it, and advising, promoting and encouraging sustainable ways of working said it was about a cultural shift.
Quite simply if we carry on the way we are, our services are going to fall off a cliff
Sophie Howe, Wales' first future generations commissioner
"One of the most critical areas I think is a focus on prevention - a shift from just dealing with the here and now," she said.
"If you like, it's not parking our ambulance at the bottom of a cliff and waiting for them to fall over - but getting them on top of that cliff and making sure they don't fall in the first place."
"This is about a nurse thinking it's as much her responsibility to identify an issue of domestic abuse as a police officer," she added.
"It's incredibly tough but something we have got to do. Quite simply if we carry on the way we are, our services are going to fall off a cliff."
THE PUBLIC SERVICES BUDGET CONUNDRUM
Others, too, sense a risk.
In successive recent budgets, hundreds of millions of extra pounds have been pumped into the NHS, largely to help it cope with the pressure its under.
Yet other areas have been squeezed.
We have to be wary of the health service in terms of its funding mechanism, crowding out other services
Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association
"I pose this question: what do you want your public sector to be?
"If we carry on the same route, especially if austerity continues and deepens in this next period, the public sector will be schools and hospitals and very little else.
"The danger is you exclusively look at one part of the system and forget another part. We have to be wary of the health service in terms of its funding mechanism, crowding out other services.
"I'm hoping with the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, if the Welsh Government is serious about prevention, they will follow that philosophy through.
"Then you're going to have to start thinking about some of those services which stop people getting into hospital in the first place and you're going to have to think about properly funding them."
A WORLD PERSPECTIVE
Dr Piroska Ostlin, director of policy and governance for health and well-being at the World Health Organization (WHO), in Cardiff for a two-day public health conference, said: "The biggest challenge we have now is to address health inequities which are very closely related to social inequities.
"It has an economic side as well, it costs a lot of money. Health is a very expensive business but it's interesting we only spend only 2-3% on prevention and health promotion, the rest is curative care."
She said the Future Generation Act in Wales was a major forward-looking landmark which could be a model the rest of the world could use - but it needed to be implemented in Wales or there could be a rise in health problems.
"We know what the root causes of health inequalities are - bad housing, low education, low income, poverty - these factors cannot be controlled by the health sector, we need really the help of other sectors. We have to absolutely abandon the silo approach."
People understand the NHS is under more pressure than ever before.
And any opinion poll will tell you, it is top priority for voters.
But broadly speaking the NHS is there to help us when things go wrong.
The question is how do you prevent more of those things from going wrong in the first place.
Health is about so much more of course than the NHS. The challenge is about striking the balance.
summary More and more of us are living longer than ever, according to a new study.

article In a statement to the Ballymena Guardian, the members, who are all from the north Antrim area, said the move was in reaction to the treatment received by former MLA Daith√≠ McKay.
Sinn F√©in said it was "disappointed" at the resignations.
Mr McKay resigned earlier this month over claims he "coached" a blogger to give evidence to a Stormont inquiry.
He accepted his actions were "inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong".
One of the 18 to resign, Monica Digney, told the BBC that it was "not a decision we took lightly".
"I have been a republican all my life," the former councillor said. "I will die a republican. But, I don't have to be  a Sinn F√©in republican.
"Because, what has happened recently is there seems to be some people who get protected and other people are left hung out to dry and Daith√≠ McKay, unfortunately, is one of those that was left hung out to dry."
Ms Digney was the first Sinn F√©in member to be elected to Ballymena Council.
Last week, the party announced it would replace Daith√≠ McKay with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor Philip McGuigan.
Those who have resigned told the Ballymena Guardian it was "inconceivable" that they could remain in light of the way they believe Mr McKay was treated.
They also criticised what they called the "anointing" of his successor without, they claim, any meaningful consultation.
Paul Maguire, a member of Mid and East Antrim council, said he intended to sit as an independent.
He claimed others in the party were considering their positions and more resignations may follow.
In a statement, Sinn F√©in said it was "disappointed at the decision of individuals in North Antrim to resign from the party following Daith√≠ McKay's resignation as MLA".
The statement added: "Daithi McKay acknowledged that his contact with loyalist Jamie Bryson was inappropriate and wrong".
It said it had "consulted with party activists in the North Antrim area and, following approval by the party's Ard Chomhairle, Philip McGuigan was co-opted as an MLA for the constituency.
"Sinn F√©in will continue to provide first-class representation for the people of North Antrim."

article The former Doctor Who companion is Nebula in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, which topped the North American box office in its debut weekend.
Its takings of $94m (√Ç¬£55.8m) set a record for a film opening in August.
The movie also stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista, while Bradley Cooper voices an alien racoon called Rocket.
Gillan, from Inverness, who played Amy Pond in Doctor Who, told the BBC News Scotland website: "This is my first villain - the first of many one would hope.
"I had to train in martial arts and work out four times a week to be able to handle the fight sequences with Zoe Saldana."
Gillan added: "I was aware of the Marvel films that had gone before, so I knew the standard would be high.
"And to play a villain in one of those was about the most exciting thing ever."
The actress had her head shaved before making her bid for the role of Nebula.
She said: "When I was asked to audition, I had to agree the shave my head before I could even get in the room.
"But that was fine with me, I was looking for something drastic."
For her performances in the film, Gillan was required to spend five hours in make up.
She said: "It was worth every second. And I got to watch films on my iPad while being turned blue."
Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called "Phase 2" project.
The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.
Gillan said: "I'd never heard of Guardians - like most of the general population.
"But that was exciting because it is new, we are establishing something, taking a risk and we get to be the first actors to ever play these roles in cinema. That's cool to me."

article Rusting pit wheels, towering over disused mine shafts and mountainous slag heaps, are now disguised beneath wild and rampant vegetation.
Even the light industry that replaced the coal mines is disappearing.
On the edge of town the local Samsonite factory, which closed in 2007, is forlorn and abandoned.
Its enormous factory floor is now home to squatters - they have replaced the workers whose jobs were transferred to Eastern Europe.
Five years on from the closure half of the 200 people who were made redundant are still unemployed.
To former worker Brigitte Petit the factory provided more than just a salary - it gave structure and life to her local community.
"We were like a family," she said. "We loved our work. And they made us believe it was a job for life."
"Today we feel abandoned, betrayed," Ms Petit said.
Amid such anger and despair the far right party of Marine Le Pen is finding record support.
Nowhere in France did Marine Le Pen perform better in the presidential election than in this region. This weekend she stands for the parliamentary seat - one of a handful of constituencies where her party, the National Front (FN), believes it can win.
"We want change," said one supporter who waited for a signed photograph of Ms Le Pen.
"No to Europe. We want to go back to the franc. We have been ripped off by the euro. We don't have the means to live any more. I had to cancel my car insurance to feed my children."
But scenting blood is Ms Le Pen's arch rival, Jean-Luc Melenchon, champion of the far left and leader of the Left Front.
He has descended on Henin-Beaumont to "shine a light," he said, "on the vampires of the National Front" and to snatch from them a seat that a month ago looked guaranteed.
The FN dismiss him as an outsider who has parachuted into Henin-Beaumont to satisfy his own ego.
"It's true, I am not from here," Mr Melenchon told me. "I am not from anywhere. I was born in North Africa. I have lived all over France, like many of the people in this country."
"Madame Le Pen represents a France that no longer exists. People who've lived forever in the same place, who can never accept people from the outside."
They divide bitterly on immigration and in recent weeks the battle has grown ugly.
The National Front's well-marshalled supporters have been busy and the billboards are re-pasted every day with images of Marine Le Pen.
This week a new flyer was being distributed among traders in the town.
It caricatured the far left leader as Hitler, sporting the moustache and a swastika and behind him the Nazi party slogan "Arbeit macht frei" ("Work makes you free"). Mr Melenchon has complained. The FN have denied any responsibility.
But while on many issues these two parties are firmly opposed to one another, on economic matters there are surprising parallels.
These are populist parties, inward-looking. They appeal to the suspicion in France that surrounds capitalism and the free market.
Both advocate a rise in the minimum wage. They are Eurosceptic, albeit in different ways. Mr Melenchon is not anti-Europe, but he does not think it is working for France. And both pledge protectionism, to defend French jobs from the "evils" of globalisation.
In the local party headquarters Marine Le Pen tells me she is amused by Mr Melenchon's challenge.
"I think he loves me," she laughed. "He follows me all around the country."
But she tells me I am wrong to draw parallels between her party and the Left Front. There are fundamental differences, she says.
"The extreme left remain 'internationaliste'," she said. "We are patriots. We believe in the French nation."
"Only the French people can guarantee their own prosperity, security, identity," Ms Le Pen said. "The far left is opposed to our brand of nationalism. They are not against Europe. Far from it, they want more Europe."
There are two rounds of the parliamentary election - and the decisive 17 June round follows a first-past-the-post system. Up to 10 candidates will stand in the first round this Sunday.
The frontrunners go through to the second round, which tends to become a two- or three-horse race.
There has been a longstanding agreement, particularly on the left, that candidates running third will stand aside to give a better placed candidate a clear run.
That could happen in Henin-Beaumont, where either the governing Socialists or Mr Melenchon will progress alone.
Nationally the first round will give a true picture of what level of support each party has.
Bruno Jeanbart, a pollster from OpinionWay, says he expects to see the Socialists win with a narrow majority - essential if President Francois Hollande is to force through his reform programme.
But the vote for the National Front, Mr Jeanbart said, could mark a turning point. Not least in its challenge to the party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative UMP.
"Traditionally the (National Front) lost one-third of their votes between presidential and legislative elections," Mr Jeanbart said.
"If they perform well in this election it shows people are not only voting for Marine Le Pen, they are voting for the National Front itself. And they are voting for the far right, and its agenda, to become part of the mainstream."
On a personal level Ms Le Pen badly needs to capture Henin-Beaumont to capitalise on her recent success.
The polls do have her comfortably ahead for Sunday's first round vote. But she will be defeated a week later if the Socialists do decide step aside and endorse Mr Melenchon, in the decisive second round.

article England won the day-night Test - the first game in the three-match series - by an innings and 209 runs inside three days at Edgbaston.
West Indies have not won a Test in England for 17 years.
"Every time they have arrived in England, they seem to have got worse," Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special.
West Indies lost 19 wickets on Saturday to be bowled out for 168 and 137 in reply to England's 514-8 declared.
Their squad is without established stars Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy after a disagreement with Cricket West Indies over selection.
However, their decline from the all-conquering side of the 1980s can be traced back to the mid-1990s - they have not won a series away from home against a team other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe since 1995.
"There are a lot of young players in the West Indies side and you need to give them time, but I find it difficult to think they can go on without any senior players," said Vaughan, who captained England in 51 of his 82 Tests.
"There is no one there to teach them. I really fear that this series could be one of the saddest for Test cricket."
England, who were rated as the worst team in the world in 1999, drew a three-Test series in West Indies as recently as 2015.
"I don't think this era of cricket is any different to any other era," said England coach Trevor Bayliss.
"There have always been strong teams and one or two that are struggling.
"West Indies are going through a rough time but 20, 40, 60 years ago there were other teams that were going through rough periods."
England captain Joe Root said West Indies' display should not detract from the performance of his side, who beat South Africa 3-1 in their previous Test series this summer.
"We talk about being ruthless," he said. "We played some really good cricket and it's important we look to back that up."
Jermaine Blackwood, who scored an unbeaten 79 off 76 in the first innings, was the only West Indies batsmen to pass 40 in a game in which England's Alastair Cook made 243 and Root 136.
West Indies skipper Jason Holder said: "We just weren't up for scratch.
"We lacked consistency when we bowled and we didn't put up any runs in either the first or the second innings.
"Each player has to look themselves in the mirror and see in what way they can improve.
"It's important for us to regroup. This series is not lost. It's important we don't drop our heads. Obviously I believe. I have to believe."
The day-night Test, the first to be held in the UK, was arranged partly to help England prepare for the Ashes, where they will meet Australia in a floodlit Test in Adelaide.
"To have a taste of it before the Ashes is important," said Root.
"The visuals of the ball, getting used to batting at different points in the day, there will be different challenges that lie ahead.
"But to play in that environment and to know what it's about is a good thing moving forward."

article Police were called to water pump company Selwood in Chandler's Ford industrial estate, Hampshire, on Wednesday afternoon after the driver raised the alarm.
Hampshire Constabulary said in total it had arrested two men and a woman on suspicion of immigration offences.
They remain in custody. The Home Office said at least one man was Sudanese.
It added: "His case is being progressed in line with the immigration rules.
"Where someone has no right to remain in the UK, we will take action to remove them."
A statement from Selwood said: "A member of staff at the security gate alerted the police after the driver of a lorry which had stopped before entering the site raised concerns that there may be people in the vehicle.
"The lorry was due to make a delivery to Selwood.
"The matter was handled by the police and the lorry, which had been sent by a supplier from Germany, was taken onto the site at Chandler's Ford."

article Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it would be "totally wrong" for the visit to go ahead later this year.
A petition to stop it has reached over 300,000 meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.
The visit was announced during PM May's trip to the US - no date has been set.
Downing Street were asked for a response to the calls to cancel. A spokesman said: "We extended the invite and it was accepted."
Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said:  "I think we should make it very clear we are extremely upset about it, and I think it would be totally wrong for him to be coming here while that situation is going on.
"I think he has to be challenged on this. I am not happy with him coming here until that ban is lifted, quite honestly."
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron backed the call. He said: "Any visit by President Trump to Britain should be on hold until his disgraceful ban comes to an end.
"Otherwise Theresa May would be placing the Queen in an impossible position of welcoming a man who is banning British citizens purely on grounds of their faith."
Alex Salmond, the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman, said he thought the state visit was "a very bad idea".
Also appearing on Sky News' Sophy Ridge, he said: "You shouldn't be rushing into a headlong relationship with the President of the United States."
Mr Salmond said reports Mr Trump was reluctant to meet Prince Charles during the visit were "an indication of the sort of enormous difficulties you get into when you hold somebody tight who is unpredictable, who has a range of views you find unacceptable."
And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the visit should not happen while the executive order was in place.
He told Sky News: "I am quite clear, this ban is cruel, this ban is shameful, while this ban is in place we should not be rolling out the red carpet for President Trump."
Graham Guest, who started the petition, said he wanted it to "put the spotlight" on Mr Trump.
He told the Press Association: "A state visit legitimises his presidency and he will use the photo opportunities and being seen with the Queen to get re-elected.
"The wording in the petition is quite precise as I actually say that he should come here as the head of government to do government-to-government business.
"At the end of the day he is still the president and we've just got to live with that. But there's no reason why he should get all the pomp and publicity of a state visit."
Former shadow cabinet member Chuka Umunna also backed the calls to cancel the trip.
"State visits happen at the instigation of governments and, of course, you have got a prime minister who you want to have a decent working relationship with a US president.
"But they need to understand, just as they will put America first, we will put British values first."
Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has questioned the state visit on Twitter.
He wrote: "Am I alone in finding it impossible to bear that in pursuit of her deeply wrong-headed policies our PM is now forcing THAT MAN on our Queen?"
Conservative MP for Totnes, Sarah Wollaston, earlier tweeted that the US President should not be invited to address the Houses of Parliament, saying Westminster Hall "should be reserved for leaders who have made an outstanding positive difference in the world".

article An estimated 131 freelancers could be offered staff contracts as a result, following a tax review by accountants Deloitte and BBC auditors.
However, the BBC said there is "no evidence" it used personal service companies to help aid tax avoidance.
It commissioned the report after a government review of tax paid by staff.
The Public Accounts Committee report said too many staff, in the government and the BBC, made their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less.
The report found that in total some 2,400 civil servants were subject to such "off-payroll" arrangements.
The review of the BBC's freelance contracting arrangements, published on Wednesday, covered all staff contracted and paid in the financial year 2011/12.
Deloitte and the internal auditors identified 804 freelance talent paid more than √Ç¬£50,000 that year that should be the subject of the BBC's new employment test as a matter of priority.
It is estimated 131 of these could be offered staff contracts when their current contracts expire.
The BBC said this new employment test will also now be carried out on any new staff, to help move away from the practice of engaging on-air talent on long term contracts as personal service companies, when a staff contract would be appropriate.
It is hoped the changes will be in place by the start of the new tax year in April 2013.
Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, welcomed the report, adding: "It is essential the public have confidence that publicly funded institutions have in place arrangements to ensure their staff pay the proper tax.
"The Government has introduced unprecedented levels of transparency into the tax arrangements of public sector workers paid off payroll. I hope when the BBC publish their new policy on freelancer engagement, it is equally as transparent."
The BBC admitted in the report that its current policy for contracting staff was "inconsistent".
The corporation added that this had resulted in on-air talent doing very similar work while being classified in a variety of ways; either as staff, self-employed or contracted through a personal service company.
"Our review shows the BBC is not using personal service companies to avoid tax or help others avoid tax," said Zarin Patel, the BBC's chief financial officer.
"Nevertheless, it shows inconsistencies in the way our policy has been applied. We are addressing this with a more objective employment test for all new contracts and by developing a new framework with HMRC for self-employed on-air presenters."
The BBC said it was making the changes to help address "the public perception that off-payroll contracts and in particular personal service companies are used to avoid tax".
It said retaining a freelance model was "critical" for the success of the BBC - and that staff would only be contracted via a personal service company when it was "absolutely satisfied" that was the most suitable method of employment.
Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of broadcasting union Bectu, said it was pleased with the results of the review.
The union, he said, "welcomes the Deloitte report's confirmation that the tax arrangements for the majority of freelances we represent are legitimate, and that these arrangements reflect their status as genuine freelances who work for multiple employers throughout the year".
"Furthermore we welcome any move to offer staff contracts to colleagues whose employment relationship with the BBC supports this."

article The Sherlock star condemned the "slow response" to the Syrian crisis during the curtain calls of Hamlet last year.
In a GQ interview, Cumberbatch said he has "very strong opinions" about "things that matter".
But he said he normally has to "wrench myself back" because, as a well-paid actor, he is portrayed as a hypocrite.
He told the magazine: "One of the arguments was, when are you going to put a refugee in your house or your flat?
"And, you know, I do have a house, but it's empty, it's gutted, there's no electricity or water, so that wouldn't work, and I have a baby in my flat, there are no spare rooms...
"I wasn't saying, 'Yes, open the doors to everyone, yes, give them our jobs and our wives', and that whole kind of stereotype fear that nationalism has leapt on."
Cumberbatch, who has a one-year-old son with his theatre director wife Sophie Hunter, is believed to have bought a Victorian house in north London.
He said he was prompted to make his speeches after seeing the photograph of dead toddler Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach that drew attention to the refugee crisis earlier this year.
Cumberbatch added: "It's not about privilege, it's about a child dead on a beach because he's tried to escape a war."
He continued: "I find it frustrating because I do have very strong opinions about things, and I do want to say things that matter, and that are important, and I have to wrench myself back.
"Because it's so easily framed by the right as 'Booo, who's he? He's a hypocrite, he's an actor, he's paid tonnes of money, who is he to tell us how to live our lives?'" he said.
Cumberbatch also hinted that we might have seen the last of hit BBC TV series Sherlock.
"It might be the end of an era. It feels like the end of an era, to be honest. It goes to a place where it will be pretty hard to follow on immediately.
"We never say never on the show. I'd love to revisit it, I'd love to keep revisiting it, I stand by that, but in the immediate future we all have things that we want to crack on with and we've made something very complete as it is, so I think we'll just wait and see. The idea of never playing him again is really galling."

article The 'no' majority hasn't kept them at bay.
I met one of them at Edinburgh University earlier this month.
To be clear, Carlo Cottarelli wasn't there to impose draconian conditions to a bail-out of Scotland's finances. Nor was he speaking on behalf of the IMF.
He was invited to explain how taxation and spending works in federal countries, having recently co-authored a study of 13 nation states where 'sub-national regions' have extensive powers - as with the American, Australian and Indian states, Canadian provinces and German lander.
They looked also at Austria and Spain, which aren't quite federal systems, but have elements of sharing taxation and government spending from which it's worth learning.
And while this academic tome was directed towards informing the hugely complex question of how the eurozone can co-ordinate its governments' finances better, it's not hard to see the implications for future fiscal relations between Holyrood and Westminster, if the Smith Commission is to be enacted.
Or rather, a close reading of it might indicate that there are bits of the Smith Commission that might be better not enacted, or at least re-thought, at a more careful pace.
The book, Designing a European Fiscal Union, published by Routledge, √Ç¬£88, takes some digesting.
For a more readable (and cheaper) guide to devolved tax, the Scottish Parliament's research service, SPICE, is worth a look.
It helps to put the changing position of Scotland's tax autonomy into some international perspective.
The conclusion of the IMF study is that there is no one way to skin the federal cat.
The share of tax raised by 'sub-national' regions ranges from 31% in Austria to 67% in Canada. Germany is at 39%; the USA at 60%.
But if you take out shared taxes, over which the sub-national region has limited control, the picture is different. Only Canada, the US and Switzerland are above a third.  In Austria, Germany and Mexico, it's under 10%.
The study calculates a transfer dependency, a measure of how much sharing and pooling of resources goes on within each country, and that also ranges widely.
It accounts for 88% of regional spend in Mexico, 16% in Canada, and 18% in the US. Among countries more similar to the UK, figures include Austria 45%, Belgium 64%, Germany 54% and Spain 50%.
The IMF economists show that systems are, of course, shaped by the history of how countries were drawn together.
They can be changed - as is the case with the eurozone - by the often bruising experience of shocks for which their rules were not prepared.
And they depend on one commodity that is not immediately evident from the current state of Holyrood-Westminster relations: a mutual desire for co-operation and stability. That is, you can get systems that work, but all sides have to buy into them and must want to make them work.
What these arrangements require are fiscal rules, recognised by both sides. The obvious ones are around the scale of deficits and debts.
And if two governments have a different approach to taxing, spending and cutting their way out of recession - as between the Westminster coalition and the Scottish government in recent years - then there's an obvious problem.
For those who break the rules, there have to be meaningful sanctions. And as the eurozone has found (it didn't take a genius to see this problem coming), countries that run rule-breaking deficits are not well placed to pay big fines as a penalty for doing so - not without borrowing more and running a bigger deficit.
Achieving flexibility and consistency is a tricky balancing act. Co-ordinating across the economic cycle, and applying that famous economic stabiliser, requires thinking in advance of the point when the downturn hits home.
There's a long history of ad hoc arrangements being put in place when there are such crises. Together, they offer some worthwhile lessons for those trying to plan ahead for a robust system.
And there's borrowing: when should it be allowed, to what extent, by what means, who carries the risk, how much should a central government signal its willingness or unwillingness to leave its smaller partner hanging out to dry in the bond markets?
A crucial part of any federal system is the extent to which it shares risks and transfers money from the rich to the poor, from the buoyant to those fallen on relatively harder times.
All of these issues require inter-government bodies to negotiate the share-out of powers, inter-government grants, the application of rules and borrowing quotas. Both or all sides have to be politically committed to these bodies.
We're yet to see the machinery that the UK Treasury sets up which gives devolved administrations some parity of esteem in such negotiations, as the IMF indicate you ought to be able to find in Belgium, Mexico, Argentina and the USA.
That will, or would, be a big challenge to the culture and the sovereign will of Treasury ministers and mandarins. The Barnett Formula has, for 36 years, been a way of avoiding such discussions.
The IMF survey found that the answer is typically through income tax. And that is a bit of a problem, because income tax is the main pillar on which the Smith Commission built its further devolution of powers to Holyrood.
If the Scottish Parliament is to depend on buoyant income tax take, it is going to have to have very much sounder data on which to base its forecasting.
And that income tax departure from the federalised norm is a reminder that the Smith Commission seems to be based on very little assessment of what doesn't work elsewhere, before committing to what it thinks will work.
This may become clearer today as we get the draft clauses of the legislation being built on the Smith Commission foundations.
One aspect of those plans that grabbed the attention of academics discussing the IMF study with Sr Cottarelli is something called the 'no detriment' principle. It's significant because the expert in these federal systems knew of no other country which has it.
It's in the Smith Commission report, page nine, section seven, subsection five, and it goes like this: "The package of powers agreed through the Smith Commission process, when taken together, should not cause detriment to the UK as a whole nor to any of its constituent parts".
It goes on to say the further devolution should cause "neither the UK Government nor the Scottish Government to gain or lose financially simply as a consequence of devolving a specific power".
I'm hazarding a guess that you'll probably hear more about this, because if it's interpreted literally, it means that the use of any tax power which gets an advantage over another part of the UK requires compensation to the disadvantaged side.
Whatever one side gains, to the disadvantage of the other, it has to refund.
That looks fiendishly difficult to calculate in a way that either side of such negotiations could agree upon, as the impact could be felt over many years.
And whether it's designed to look this way or not, the implication is that a lot of policy divergence would be rendered pointless. And if you can't diverge policy to make a difference, why bother having the power?
Indeed, this problem is already being seen in the assumptions being made about the devolution of stamp duty to Holyrood, and the impact that has on the Scottish block grant.
We've seen problems and anomalies arise around this sort of thing before - for instance, when the funding of English students diverged from Scotland's, when water boards were privatised but not in Scotland, and when free personal care in Scotland didn't align with the UK-wide attendance allowance.
To return to the debate before 18 September 2014, would independence avoid such difficult circumstances? Possibly. But remember the need for negotiations to share the pound sterling as the continuing currency for Scotland?
A lot of the challenges facing federal systems would crop up in these talks too. The book is, after all, about the choices facing independent countries which share the euro.

"Thanks to all the fans because it was a super night," Warnock added.
"I'm pleased for our lads as well, because when you're a pro and you come to a non-league club like Taffs Well you could get a wrong attitude.

article More than 2,000 guests from around the world paid their last respects at the biggest such occasion since the Queen Mother's funeral in 2002.
Thousands of members of the public and the armed forces lined the funeral procession route through London.
PM David Cameron said it was a "fitting tribute" to a major figure.
Four thousand police officers were on duty in central London but, despite concerns about demonstrations, only a small number of protesters voiced their opposition to Lady Thatcher's policies and there were no arrests.
Elsewhere, around the country:
The congregation at St Paul's included Lady Thatcher's family and all surviving British prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, the current cabinet and surviving members of Lady Thatcher's governments.
There were tears, and occasional laughter, as the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, paid tribute to Lady Thatcher's forthright character in a simple service, which, at her personal request, did not include any eulogies.
"After the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm," said Bishop Chartres.
"The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure - even an ism.
"Today the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service.
"Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all human beings."
Chancellor George Osborne appeared to wipe away a tear as the bishop reflected on Lady Thatcher's life.
The day began with Lady Thatcher leaving Parliament for the last time as a hearse took her body from the crypt chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster to the start of the military procession at St Clement Danes in The Strand.
The union jack draped-coffin was topped with a large bunch of white flowers and a note, by Lady Thatcher's children Sir Mark and Carol, reading: "Beloved mother, always in our hearts."
A gun carriage drawn by six black horses carried the coffin through the streets to St Paul's, where the funeral service began with readings from the King James Bible by Mr Cameron and Lady Thatcher's 19-year-old granddaughter Amanda, and hymns chosen by the former prime minister.
By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor
The service ended with a blessing from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.
Lady Thatcher's coffin was borne out of the cathedral and returned to a hearse which took it to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and then to Mortlake Crematorium in south west London for a private cremation.
Lady Thatcher, who was Conservative Prime Minister from 1979 until 1990, died on 8 April, following a stroke, at the age of 87.
She was accorded a ceremonial funeral with military honours, one step down from a state funeral.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said it would have been seen as extraordinary not to commemorate her life.
Asked about those who wanted to challenge his view of Lady Thatcher, the prime minister said:  "Of course people have the right to disagree and take a different view.
"But when you're mourning the passing of an 87-year-old woman who was the first woman prime minister, who served for longer in the job than anyone for 150 years I think it's appropriate to show respect."
There were more than 50 guests associated with the Falkland Islands, including veterans from the 1982 conflict with Argentina, but Argentina's ambassador to London, Alicia Castro declined an invitation to attend.
Alan Southern, a former member of the Parachute Regiment who fought in the Falklands War, said: "Lady Thatcher was an absolutely wonderful lady. She loved the armed forces and she did so much for the country, she put the 'great' back in Great Britain."
In total, two current heads of state, 11 serving prime ministers and 17 serving foreign ministers from around the world attended.
Notable absences were former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who could not attend because of ill health, and former US first lady Nancy Reagan, who was also unable to come.
Six police forces from outside London sent specialist officers to help with escorting foreign dignitaries.
There were union jacks on display, as well as flags from the US, Canada, Scotland, Poland and the Falkland Islands.
St Paul's has published a full funeral order of service.
