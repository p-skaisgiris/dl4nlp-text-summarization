article Many thousands of others have risked their lives this year, fleeing conflict and instability in Africa and the Middle East, in small, often decrepit vessels in an attempt to reach European territories.
But the number of fatalities has risen dramatically in a matter of months. More than 2,200 lives have been lost since June, the UN refugee agency UNHCR believes.
That is because of the big increase in numbers crossing the Mediterranean. While some 60,000 reached European shores in 2013, so far more than 130,000 have arrived in 2014.
The majority of migrants head for Italy, prompting a crisis that the country's navy, coast guard and beleaguered immigration facilities are struggling to handle.
Last October, 366 people died off the Italian island of Lampedusa when the fishing boat they were travelling in from Libya capsized.
Nearly all the victims were Eritrean. Migrants crossing in the central Mediterranean - from Libya and Tunisia - have until recently come mostly from Eritrea and Somalia, although increasing numbers of Syrians fleeing the country's civil war are also making the journey.
Libya has become a popular starting point for many journeys, with people traffickers exploiting the country's power vacuum and increasing lawlessness.
The relatively short distance to Lampedusa encourages more people to risk the journey.
Migration charities believe that as many as 20,000 people may have died at sea trying to reach Europe in the last two decades.
Malta's prime minister warned after the Lampedusa tragedy that the Mediterranean was in danger of becoming of a "cemetery" for desperate migrants.
'Age-old' issue
The number of people using the various routes across the Mediterranean has ebbed and flowed.
From 2008-2012, large numbers of migrants crossed between Turkey and Greece via the so-called Eastern Mediterranean route, border management agency Frontex reports.
In response, Greece bolstered border controls with an additional 1,800 police officers.
However, Frontex suggests that the area remains problematic, and points to "uncertainties related to the sustainability of [Greek] efforts, and evidence that migrants are waiting in Turkey for the end of the operation".
Over the last decade, the central Mediterranean route has experienced periodic surges in migrant traffic.
UNHCR figures suggest that some 25,000 people fled to Italy from North Africa in 2005, a number which dwindled to 9,573 in 2009.
In 2011, this figure rocketed back to some 61,000, driven by the conflict in Libya which culminated in the downfall of Col Gaddafi.
Earlier in the decade, the most popular route was from West Africa to Spain, including its North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla, and the Canary Islands, with some 32,000 irregular arrivals in 2006. This figure had dwindled to just 5,443 by 2011.
summary Thousands of people have died trying to reach Europe by sea, many of them children.

article Full-back Halfpenny, 26, is out of contract with Toulon at the end of the season and is weighing up his options.
Blues coach Danny Wilson says they cannot offer the highest wages but would be able to ensure Halfpenny is in "peak" condition for Wales.
"The best interests of the player internationally would be at the front of our minds," said Wilson.
Halfpenny, who made 87 appearances for the Blues between 2008 and 2014 , would be a strong contender for a national dual contract (NDC) if he returned to Wales after spending two years in France.
The salary on such a deal would be funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), with the region paying the rest.
In return for the financial support, the regions agree to limit the number of appearances the player makes to suit the needs of the national side.
Wilson believes the prospect of being managed in that way would be a major attraction for Halfpenny, whose career has been blighted by injury, including missing the recent Rugby World Cup.
"The design of the central [NDC] contract is to get our best players playing and staying in Wales, and therefore the management of those players has to be a huge selling point," he said.
"Between us and the strong relationship with the Welsh Rugby Union, the player gets the management he wants to peak and perform for Wales.
"That's the idea of it and that has to be a selling point from a regional relationship. The other selling point we don't have is the same money as other people have to offer."
Scarlets have also voiced their interest in the British and Irish Lion, while Premiership side Wasps have been strongly linked.
Both are likely to be involved in the top tier of European competition next season, the Champions Cup, whereas the Blues are set to be in the second tier Challenge Cup.
If Halfpenny wants to return to Wales, the binding agreement between the WRU and the Welsh regions gives the Blues first refusal as the region that developed him.
"If Leigh does make a decision he wants to come back to Wales, I'd like to think Cardiff Blues would be high on his list of considerations," said Wilson.
"I'd imagine all four regions would like to have Leigh Halfpenny playing for them.
"A calibre of player like Leigh Halfpenny will have many options, whether that's regions, clubs over the bridge, clubs in France.
"There are a number of players we are talking to - players we are in the process of finalising conversations with and we'll see how things pan out."
summary Toulon have a new defender in the pipeline for the upcoming season.

article The claim: The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables.
Reality Check verdict: This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources.
It came after he had said: "If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed."
Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in a speech in February as being a "patriotic endeavour".
The manifesto says the party would: "Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030."
A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as "visionary as opposed to completely literal".
The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy.
The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient.
There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors.
It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it.
While there have been suggestions that marine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage.
The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system.
Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it.
So in 2016, the UK generated 24.4% of its electricity from renewables, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing 8.8% of energy from renewables.
The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive 30% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve.
The Labour manifesto pledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030.
The Conservative manifesto looks at it in a different way, saying that "energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives".
So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, "reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change".
The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating.
It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

article That follows an admission by VW that it had found "irregularities" in carbon dioxide emissions levels that could affect 800,000 vehicles.
It came to light as a result of an internal investigation by the firm following the diesel emissions scandal.
The UK said it was "pressing VW to provide urgent clarity".
On Tuesday, the company admitted that an internal investigation had revealed that carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption were understated during standards tests on about 800,000 cars.
VW said the issue mainly affected diesel cars.
However, on Wednesday Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the country's parliament:
"Today we were told that among the affected vehicles are 98,000 petrol vehicles".
Meanwhile the UK's Department for Transport said it "takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously."
"We are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation... This [CO2] development underlines the importance of the government's ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used," a spokesperson said.
VW, Skoda, Audi and Seat vehicles could be affected and the company estimates the CO2 problem could cost it about €2bn (£1.4bn).
VW had already set aside €6.7bn (£4.7bn) to meet the cost of the initial emissions scandal.
News of the issue with carbon dioxide emissions sent VW shares down by 5.6% on Wednesday.
The firm's shares have lost about a third of their value since September, when the scandal first broke.
It came to light after the US Environmental Protection Agency found VW software had detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions tests, and altered the way they operated to give more favourable results.
On Monday, US authorities also alleged that VW had fitted nitrogen oxide defeat devices on 3.0 litre diesel engines used in Porsche, Audi and VW vehicles - a claim VW denied.
Porsche also denied the allegations, but its North American division announced it is discontinuing sales of Porsche Cayenne diesel sport utility vehicles until further notice.
The carmaker is recalling 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide that were fitted with the software that circumvented tests for emissions of nitrogen oxide.
That recall is for cars with variants of the EA 189 diesel engine built to the "Euro 5" emissions standard.
Meanwhile. Volkswagen is recalling 92,000 cars in the US over a mechanical problem that could affect vehicles' brakes.
The German carmaker said part of the camshaft could shear off, causing loss of vacuum in the power brakes, which could lengthen stopping distances.
Wednesday's recall includes Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat models from 2015 and 2016. The cars have 1.8 litre and 2 litre turbocharged petrol engines.
VW discovered the problem after getting reports of camshaft failures. A fix is expected by the end of March.

article The US banking giant said net income in its corporate and investment banking division was $2.5bn, up $412m compared with the same period a year earlier.
But it also reported an after-tax charge of $487m for legal expenses.
And it set aside a total of $959m to cover bad loans, $109m higher than a year earlier.
JPMorgan's legal expenses stem in part from the fact that it still faces an investigation by the US Justice Department into its involvement in the manipulation of foreign exchange markets.
It also faces a probe into its hiring policy in Asia.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the US, reported a 2.6% fall in profits in the first three months of the year and set aside more money to cover bad loans.
Net income was $5.46bn in the three months to the end of March ,compared with $5.61bn a  year earlier.
The bank said it was setting aside $617m for credit losses an increase of $198m on the same three months a year earlier.
JPMorgan said revenue from fixed-income bond trading rose 5% to $4.07bn, adjusted for the sale of businesses last year, including a commodities operation.
"We have an outstanding franchise which is getting safer and stronger, and is gaining market share over time," said chief executive Jamie Dimon.
"We continue to build the company for the long-term, we are investing in controls, infrastructure, systems, technology, new products and bankers."
The bank said it was increasing its second quarter dividend from $0.40 to $0.44.
JPMorgan's investment bank, along with its rivals, is under pressure to cut costs as customers have reduced their trading activity following the financial crisis.
Regulators have also demanded that big banks take fewer risks, hold more capital and improve controls.
The bank has said it wants to cut expenses by $2.8bn by 2017, excluding legal costs, though some of the savings are expected to be offset by more spending to improve risk controls.
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are the first of the large US banks to report quarterly results.
Overall, results are expected to show that low interest rates have continued to hold down profits as consumers and businesses refinance loans at lower rates.
summary US bank Citigroup has reported a record profit for the first quarter of the year, up

article Elsewhere there's some significant action on the committee corridor, with quite a collection of Cabinet ministers appearing before various committees.
As the current crop of bills before Parliament peters out, the committee corridor may well become the focus of attention for the coming months, particularly with 30 select committee inquiries into various Brexit-related topics now under way.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - with any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions following at 3.30pm.
The main legislating is on the Digital Economy Bill, where there are some significant issues in play at report stage.
The government has accepted an important amendment from the former minister Claire Perry, who had heavyweight cross party backing for her call to add powers to the bill allowing the government to make internet service providers block porn websites that failed to comply with a requirement for age verification for their viewers.
The argument was that this was needed to give real teeth to the bill, and it has now been accepted by ministers, who're bringing in their own version of these powers, in a government amendment.
Labour, though, have reservations about the new government proposal and may even vote against it. And they argue that the best defence for children is compulsory sex education, starting at Key Stage 1, and will be pushing an amendment to that effect.
Watch out too for a Labour new clause, which seeks to create a procedure to deal with the growing problems of breaches of personal data security. This would create an obligation on data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner and those whose details had been compromised.
Labour also want to add in new laws to combat ticket touts and they will also be opposing the clauses transferring the policy over free BBC licence fees for the over-75s to the BBC, on the argument that the Corporation is not the appropriate body to take decisions on welfare policy. They plan to force that issue to a vote.
The Westminster Hall debate (4.30pm- 7.30pm) is on e-petition 162934 relating to child cancer - which calls on the government to make more funding available in the fight against child cancer.
The debate will be led by the Conservative, Ben Howlett, who said the petition had been brought by a couple whose child sadly passed away after a battle with a very rare cancer. Childhood cancer is the biggest killer by disease of children in the western world and currently the survival rates vary considerably between different types of cancer, age and gender. He wants to urge the government to do more to look at the funding for both research and testing new drugs for childhood cancer as well as new awareness campaigns aimed at parents.
Committee of the day is the Transport Committee hearing (4.05pm) on rail safety, which will ponder the issues around rising passenger numbers and problems, with the Rail Delivery Group, the Rail Safety and Standards Broad (RSSB) as well as the ASLEF, RMT and Unite trade unions.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) peers have another day debating the Pension Schemes Bill at committee stage - key issues include more on Master Trusts and on private pension scheme exit fees.
And the Lib Dem peer, Lord Alderdice, leads a debate on ensuring parity of esteem between mental and physical health.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Treasury questions - followed by the day's Ten Minute Rule Bill which is on Statutory Nuisance (Aircraft Noise) -  fresh from a Westminster Hall debate on this issue, Dr Tania Mathias, whose constituency lies under the Heathrow flightpath, takes her battle against a third runway to the floor of the Commons chamber.
That is followed by the second reading of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill - a two-clause micro-measure which will raise the limit on government financial assistance that can be provided to CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation) (the "CDC") to Â£6bn.
This could be a micro-second reading debate as well - leaving time for opposed private business - a number of private bills (bills dealing with a private interest) have popped up from time to time, for formal approval, only to be pulled when backbench vigilantes like Christopher Chope threaten to object to them. The aim of these challengers it to get the measures debated - and this may now occur.
In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by the debate led by Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts, on CCTV in equine slaughterhouses (2.30pm-4pm).
My committee pick is the Justice Committee hearing (9.45pm) with Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah and Michael Spurr, Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service. The current state of the prison system can hardly be avoided. Unusually this inquiry begins, rather than ends with a hearing with a minister - and its focus could well branch out in several directions, as the hearings continue.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Public Health England and NHS officials give evidence to the Health Committee on suicide prevention and whether there is sufficient support for mental health in the NHS (2.30pm).
And there's an interesting in-house encounter - the Standards Committee hearing (10am) on the MPs' Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules. The witnesses include the MPs' main shop stewards: Graham Brady,  Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee; John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the SNP; plus Bernard Jenkin, Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee; Dr Sarah Wollaston, Chair of the Health Committee, and backbench standards crusader, John Mann, one of the most active complainants on standards issues (at 10.50am).
In the Lords (2.30pm) the main debate is on the economy, in the light of the Autumn Statement.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with half an hour of Welsh questions, followed at noon by PMQs.
Then, the Labour MP Justin Madders proposes a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make it easier for young people to go to games; his Football Supporters (Access) Bill deals with ticket prices and kick off times and calls for a proportion of transfer fees to be earmarked to develop facilities for local clubs and young people.
The day's main debate will be on an SNP motion - subject to be announced - and there's an intriguing looking adjournment debate from the SNP's Gavin Newlands, on Paisley's cultural contribution to the world.
And Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green will be questioned (9.30am) by the Work and Pensions Committee about his department's finances, after the cash injection in the Autumn Statement.
My other committee pick is Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's appearance before the Environmental Audit Committee (2.20pm), to talk about the environmental concerns around Heathrow expansion and the plans to mitigate air pollution, carbon emissions and noise from a new runway.
In the Lords (3pm) the main legislation is the first report stage day on the Policing and Crime Bill - this measure will probably provide the Lords' last serious legislative clashes of 2016.
There are some big issues to be fought out.
First, behind the scenes negotiations are under way to find a compromise on the provision for Police and Crime Commissioner to take over the fire and rescue authority for their area. Labour have an amendment down to delete this entire section of the bill (Clause 6), but could well be dissuaded if the government is prepared to offer stricter requirements for local consultation on such proposals - and a new government amendment on this issue has now appeared.
Compromise is less likely on Labour amendments to prevent Special Constables using CS gas and PAVA sprays, and this may be forced to a vote. There will also be an amendment on restriction on the use of police cells for those with mental health conditions
But the biggest clash may be over an attempt to add in a requirement to hold a Leveson 2-style inquiry into relations between the police and the media - as I write, no amendment has appeared but one is expected, probably fronted by a crossbench peer, but with substantial cross party support.
If passed it would probably occasion an awkward bout of parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons. And there will be plenty more controversial amendments on the next day of report stage...
As ever, on report stage days in the Lords, timing is important, and opposition amendments usually stand less chance if they're debated after the dinner break, when a lot of peers go home.
There will also be a short debate on current UK political strategy towards and plans to develop economic, security and cultural relations with Tunisia.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, David Lidington, setting out what will be on the Commons agenda in the coming weeks.
The day's main debates are on subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee. First is a debate on a motion on transgender equality: Maria Miller, Angela Crawley which will follow up on the first report of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, which looked at this issue.
That's followed by a general debate on the future of the UK fishing industry. An annual fisheries debate used to be a fixture of the parliamentary calendar, but since the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, the subject has had to take its chances along with many others.
In the Lords (11am) the main debates are on options for the UK's future relationship with the EU following the referendum - led by Lord Liddle, Tony Blair's former EU advisor, and on challenges in the current system of social care, proposals for reviewing and longer-term reform - led by Labour's Baroness Pitkeathley, a former chief executive of Carers National Association (now Carers UK).
The final debate is on the EU net-neutrality Connected Continent requirements, UK adult content filtering regimes and keeping children safe online.
It's private members' bills day in the Commons (9.30am) and first up is the second reading of the SNP MP Mhairi Black's Benefit Claimants Sanctions (Required Assessment) Bill, which aims to build new safeguards into the system under which claimants can be "fined" if they fail, for example, to attend a job interview.
She wants the system to take into account any caring or childcare responsibilities, the mental and physical health of the claimant and their housing situation, and to ensure that any claimants who are sanctioned are made aware of any emergency funding they could access. Expect a strong turnout of SNP MPs, but there is little sign of support from the government.
Then comes the Vehicle Noise Limits (Enforcement) Bill - from the Conservative, Kevin Foster. The bill would allow noise limits to be enforced via automatic monitoring equipment.
Further down the agenda lurks Ruth Cadbury's Income Tax (Non-Military Expenditure) Bill, which would require HMRC to record income tax revenue of people who say they have a 'conscientious objection' to public spending on defence purposes and to direct their taxes that would have been spent on the military to a 'non-military security fund'.
As the third bill on the Order Paper, it has little chance of any extensive debate.
In the Lords (10am) it's the annual Friday where the bishops get to debate the subject of their choice.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, leads a debate on the "Shared values underpinning our national life and their role in shaping public policy priorities".
Archbishop Welby has had some pretty interesting things to say on this subject - a few extracts from a recent speech give a flavour of the ground he may cover:
"It is imperative that we remind the nation that our values have not emerged within a secular vacuum; but from the resilient and eternal structure of our Judeo-Christian theological, philosophical and ethical heritage. ....The right to life, liberty and the rule of law and robust democratic government does not come cheaply, nor is it held lightly. The roots of our freedom in this country are deeply embedded within our British constitutional and civic life because their foundation lies within the shared scriptural inheritance of our faith traditions.....Democracy is not in and of itself the final answer to things, nor is the rule of law. Martin Luther King did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law is unjust. Quite rightly, Bonhoeffer in the 1930s did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law was palpably racist, unjust and anti-Semitic. That's one of the reasons he ended up going to the gallows. As for tolerance, it's a word like 'nice', isn't it? Completely meaningless and overused. Respect is something else - I won't go there.....Our understanding of the rights and responsibilities that flow from our God-given inheritance as human beings, enable us - Jewish and Christian communities together - to be powerful and compelling advocates for freedom in British society.
"The cutting edge of freedom must include the right to disagree, disengage and dissent. It means the freedom of others to criticise us or our views, or for those of us who hold beliefs strongly to change our minds or our beliefs. It means that we all need to be accountable to one another before God and we all need to affirm the right of others to not believe as we do. What it doesn't mean is freedom without accountability to undermine each other's faith, whether casually, incidentally or wilfully. What it cannot mean is the freedom to use language destructively and negatively about those who are different to us - or who take opinions and views with which we profoundly disagree. We have had egregious examples of that in recent weeks, aimed at our judiciary. And what it must never mean is the denial of others to practise or not practise their understanding of their religious or secular identity."

article The Co Wicklow fighter beat Victoria Torres of Mexico on a unanimous decision to make the semi-finals.
All four semi-finalists in Kazakhstan qualify for August's Olympics.
Middleweight Savannah Marshall became the 10th British boxer to book a place in Brazil by outpointing Chinese third seed Li Qian in her quarter-final bout.
Taylor, 29, who is guaranteed at least a bronze medal, impressed in Tuesday's quarter-final with a clinical display and is aiming for a sixth world title.
The Bray boxer beat Agnes Alexiusson of Sweden and Argentina's Dayana Sanchez in Astana before prevailing against Torres over four rounds.
Taylor was surprisingly beaten in the Olympic qualifier in Turkey last month.
Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna handed Taylor her first defeat in five years at the European Olympic qualifiers to leave the five-time world champion still seeking Rio qualification.
Alekseevna's victory in Samsun was Taylor's first defeat in 63 contests.
Meanwhile, Marshall, 25, will next face Dutch fighter Nouchka Fontijn for a place in the final.
Compatriot Nicola Adams kept on track for the first world gold of her career as she squeezed through against Yu-Ting Lin of Chinese Taipei in their flyweight bout.
Adams, who has already qualified for the Olympics, goes up against home favourite Ahaina Shekerbekova on Thursday, and knows she will not have to fight big rival Ren Cancan, who withdrew with food poisoning.
Great Britain's Sandy Ryan missed out on a world medal in the non-Olympic light-welterweight division as she lost on a unanimous decision to China's Wenlu Yang.

article West Midlands Police outlined the measures - which will mainly affect community support officers - as part of its efforts to save ??130m.
Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said further cuts of up to ??30m were likely to follow.
The Home Office said crime was down 16% in the region.
West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims said: "We will continue to offer the protection we currently offer but people will notice the service is delivered differently.
"There will be less visibility on the streets, fewer bobbies on the beat."
Shale Ahmed from the Aspire and Succeed Youth Centre in Lozells said the changes could be "devastating".
"For a neighbourhood like this, it's about community safety," he said.
Ravi Subramanian, from the union Unison, which represents some police staff, said the service had already suffered job losses. "This further reduction will mean a scaling back of neighbourhood policing."
Mr Jamieson said: "The West Midlands has seen 24% cuts - that isn't right.
"Last week we heard there could be another ??20-30m cuts on top of this. What we cannot do is do what we were doing before.
"We are going to lose up to half of our budget by 2020.
"What people must realise is that government austerity could have a severe effect on the quality of policing.
"It's going to be policing without frills. I'm afraid it could be like some of the European forces, where it's just response policing and the other excellent work our police do could be seriously diluted."
However, the Home Office said: "There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work.
"What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.
summary West Midlands Police has announced a series of measures to cut costs.

article The SNP said the Ipsos Mori survey for STV was a "sensational" endorsement.
The poll also indicated that the Nationalists would win next May's Holyrood election with 74 seats.
Scottish Labour said it was focusing on what mattered and the Scottish Tories said they would continue to make a positive case for the UK.
The survey, which questioned 1,002 people last week, comes almost a year after Scotland rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%.
It is thought to be the first poll to show a majority for "Yes" among all those questioned.
Previous polls in the run-up to the September 2014 vote that showed a majority for independence had excluded those who were undecided.
Half of those questioned for STV said they would like to see another referendum within five years while 58% said they would be in favour of having one in the next 10 years.
Support for the SNP continues to be high in the wake of the party's landslide general election victory north of the border, winning 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats.
The poll found that 55% of those who gave a voting intention would back the Nationalists in the Scottish Parliament constituency vote if the election was held tomorrow.
About a fifth (21%) would vote Labour, with support for the Tories at 12%, Liberal Democrats at 7% and Greens at 3%.
In the list vote, SNP support fell to 50% and backing for the Greens rose to 8%, with the preferences for the other parties remaining the same.
The SNP's business convener Derek Mackay said: "This is a sensational poll for the SNP - it shows not only that people across Scotland support us in huge and growing numbers eight years into government, but that they believe we have a strong record on key issues like health and education."
He added: "It is welcome to see support for independence now stands at over 50 per cent, as people see the SNP in government and at Westminster stand up for Scotland."
A Scottish Labour spokesman said that the party, under the new leadership of Kezia Dugdale, was changing.
He added: "We want people to take another look at Scottish Labour.
"But we know it's too early to be asking people for their votes.
"Over the coming months, we will put Labour's values first and we will focus on the things that matter in people's lives - like the standards in our schools and our hospitals."
The Scottish Conservative Party said it would "always stand up for" the two million people in Scotland who voted "No" in last year's referendum.
A spokesman added: "For its part, rather than revelling in this poll, the SNP needs to focus on the day job.
"While the Scottish government takes Scotland down the constitutional cul-de-sac, education standards have fallen and the police service set up by this SNP government just two years ago is facing breakdown.
"Scotland needs a better way forward, not a step back to yet another referendum."
The pollsters interviewed 1002 people between the 24 and 30 August.  The margin of error was plus or minus three.
summary STV has backed the Scottish National Party's election campaign.

article Mr Wilson was 21 when he went missing from his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast in 1973.
He is believed to have been abducted and murdered by the IRA.
On Tuesday, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said results of DNA tests confirmed the remains were Mr Wilson's.
His body will now be released to his family.
Members of the Wilson family had just attended a walk at Stormont in memory of the Disappeared on 2 November when a call came through to say his remains had been found.
His sister, Anne Connolly, said it was a shock to learn recently that he might be buried in Waterfoot as her mother, Lily, who died three years ago, often sat on village beach.
She spoke of a "mixture of relief, and great sadness" to learn that his body had been found so soon after the dig began.
Archaeologists and other experts had been examining the beach at Waterfoot in the Glens of Antrim after a tip-off to the ICLVR.
The commission has now overseen the discovery of seven bodies and numerous searches since it was set up in 1999 to locate those murdered and buried in secret graves by republican paramilitaries during the troubles.
Remains found in County Monaghan in July were confirmed as being those of Crossmaglen man Charlie Armstrong, a 57-year-old father-of-five who went missing on his way to Mass in 1981.
In October, the remains of Mr Armstrong's neighbour, Gerry Evans, were found at a site in County Louth.

article The researchers found that pandas get by on shoots and leaves because they expend extremely small amounts of energy.
A typical adult panda burns up about 38% of the calories used by other, similarly sized animals.
The scientists found the bears' slow-moving ways were linked to low levels of thyroid hormones.
Scientists have long been intrigued as to how the black and white mammals are able to live exclusively on hard-to-digest bamboo, since their stomachs still retain the gut bacteria of the omnivorous creatures they evolved from.
This new analysis sheds light on the mystery.
The researchers looked at the daily energy expenditure of five captive pandas and three living in the wild.
They found that the creatures used around 38% of the predicted value for mammals of their size. This compares to slow-moving koalas, which use around 69% of the energy normal for similarly sized animals.
The most direct comparison with the pandas' laid-back ways were three-toed sloths, which have a similarly minimal energy consumption for their size.
When the researchers measured the panda's rates of movement they found they were only active 49% of the time, and when they did move, their average speed was a less-than-blistering 20 metres per hour.
"Pandas save a lot of energy by being frugal with the energy they spend on physical activity," said Prof John Speakman, from the University of Aberdeen and Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the study's lead authors.
"However, it is not only their low activity that contributes to their low metabolism; the metabolic rate of an active panda is still lower than a completely stationary human.
"We found that their low metabolism is correlated with very low levels of thyroid hormones, which was linked to a genetic mutation in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway that is unique to the panda."
These hormone levels were the equivalent to those found in hibernating black bears.
Pandas in captivity were even less inclined to move about, rising off their bottoms for only about one third of the time they were studied.
The researchers also discovered that the panda's brain, liver and kidneys are relatively small compared to other bears.
According to WWF, there are around 1,800 pandas left in the wild in China.
The findings were reported in the journal Science.

article The aero-engine maker, which depends on oil and gas-related customers for about 60% of its business, blamed the sharp fall in crude prices for the cuts.
The marine unit has been under pressure over the past 18 months since the price of Brent crude collapsed to six-year lows, and ship orders were cancelled.
The marine business employs about 5,800 people in 34 countries.
Rolls Royce shares jumped more than 3% following the announcement.
Mikael Makinen, Rolls-Royce Marine president, said: "After many years of strong performance through to 2013, led by good growth in the oil and gas sector, our order book and profitability have been adversely impacted by the sharp and subsequently prolonged drop in the price of oil."
The cuts will mainly be in management and back office roles, a spokesman said.
"We will be consulting with our employees and their representatives over the coming weeks and months, and expect the reduction to be completed by the end of 2016," he added.
The firm expects the cuts will generate full year savings of £40m. Investment into research and development will be stepped up.
Last November, the company said it would cut its headcount by 2,600 jobs, mainly in its aerospace division.
In July, Rolls-Royce issued its fourth profit warning in 18 months on the back of the drop in oil prices.
It said its 2015 underlying profit in the marine business would be between break even and £40m, rather than between £90m and £120m.
Rolls-Royce's new chief executive Warren East, who took up the role at the beginning of July, is in the process of carrying out an operational review of the business.

article The pavilion is the final piece of a renovation project at the former Olympic venue [1948] that began in four years ago as part of the legacy project from the most recent London Games.
Since then, refurbishment of the main 450m track, the addition of a 250m junior track and new floodlights have helped double visitor numbers.
The Herne Hill track was where Sir Bradley Wiggins began his racing career, aged 12.
Hillary Peachey, chairman of the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust (HHVT), said: "It has been a long journey, but I am immensely proud of how the community came together, matched by the generosity of our funders, the project team and the local residents."
Alongside substantial contributions from the London Marathon Charitable Trust, Southwark Council and City Hall, Sport England provided £750,000 of Lottery funds towards construction, while a recent crowdfunding initiative organised by the Friends of the HHV raised £89,000 to fit out the pavilion.
The opening of the facility was attended by Brian Cookson, president of world cycling's governing body the UCI, plus dignitaries including former sport and Olympics minister Baroness Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich and West Norwood Helen Hayes, and London's Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross,
The velodrome hosts a range of activities for different ages and abilities, including dedicated sessions for young children, women, veterans (40+) and free drop-in sessions for the disabled through charity Wheels for Wellbeing. Visit the HHV website for details of times and pricing.

article Bruce's side won the first leg 3-0 before losing 2-0 in the second leg on Tuesday to edge through to Wembley.
"We handled the occasion really well on Saturday but we couldn't put one front in foot of the other on Tuesday," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"It was a really difficult evening but we've got through."
Bruce has led Hull to Wembley three times in the last four seasons and achieved promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge.
They were relegated to the Championship in 2015 but Bruce has led them steadily up the table, finishing the season in fourth place.
"It could have been our most embarrassing night but it's not, thank the lord," he continued.
"(Tom) Huddlestone clearly wasn't fit. That was a gamble, where he played with a knock, and I shouldn't have took that gamble."
Never in play-off history has a team overturned a three-goal first-leg deficit but Derby came close on Tuesday through Johnny Russell and Andrew Robertson's own goal.
Despite continued pressure from Derby, Hull were able to hold on and secure their spot to face Sheffield Wednesday in an all-Yorkshire final on 28 May.
"I won't try and mask it up any more - we did enough at Derby, where we put in a good performance," Bruce added.
"We know we will perform better than that because we can't be any worse. Let's make sure now that we try our upmost because we have just seen our Achilles heel."

article The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the probe was related to "financial irregularities" at the insurer.
It did not identify individuals or say if they still worked at the business.
RSA Insurance was forced to inject Â£200m into its Irish unit in 2013.
The company subsequently tapped shareholders for cash through a rights issue to help bolster its finances.
RSA's Irish unit was bailed out weeks after the resignation of its chief executive Philip Smith and after the insurer informed the market about the accounting irregularities.
Mr Smith was initially suspended after an investigation was launched into issues in the Irish unit's claims and finance functions identified during a internal routine audit.
Last month, he won a â‚¬1.25m compensation payment for a constructive dismissal.
RSA is appealing against the award.
RSA Group's chief executive, Simon Lee, also resigned in the wake of the crisis at the Irish unit. He was eventually replaced by former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester
The FRC said the investigation would cover 2012 "and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group at the end of 2013".
RSA said the FRC's investigation was not into the company itself but into individuals who were members of accounting, auditing or actuarial professional bodies.
It said in a statement: "We understand that the investigation will therefore cover members of these professions who were employed by RSA at the  time. RSA Group will of course assist with these inquiries if requested to do so."
The FRC said it would co-operate with the Irish authorities as necessary.

Fans are set to protest this weekend after a disappointing season that has seen the Gunners' Premier League title challenge fade.
"When we built the stadium the banks demanded that I signed for five years," said the 66-year-old Frenchman.
"Do you want me to say how many clubs I turned down during that period?"
Construction began on the £390m Emirates Stadium in 2004, the year Wenger won the last of his three league titles with the club.
"The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that we have a chance to pay them back," added Wenger, who has been in charge of the north Londoners since 1996.
Arsenal topped the Premier League at the turn of the year but have since slipped to fourth, some 12 points behind leaders Leicester, who can win the title this weekend.
The Gunners were also knocked out of the FA Cup, which they have won for the past two seasons, by Watford in the quarter-finals, and their Champions League campaign again ended in the last 16 for the sixth successive season.
During Saturday's home game against Norwich, fans' groups Black Scarf Movement, RedAction and the Arsenal Supporters Trust want supporters to raise placards reading: "Time for change. Arsenal is stale, fresh approach needed."
However, Wenger said his critics had gone "too far".
He added: "I did commit and I stayed, and under very difficult circumstances.
"So for me to come back and, on top of that, (critics) reproach me for not having won the championship during that period, it is a bit overboard."
Since the end of January, Arsenal have taken only 10 points from a possible 21 in seven home league games.
Wenger said his side lost out on the title "at home against the lower teams", having played some of those games "in a very difficult climate".
He added: "We have to realise that away from home we are championship winners. At home, against the smaller teams, we dropped the points.
"It is very frustrating because we were in a position for a long, long time where we could compete for the title.
"We are disappointed but we have to fight. We have not to forget that in football you go down very quickly and you come up very slowly. We have to stick together.
"I can understand the frustration of our fans but despite that we want to support our team and the best chance you can give to a team is to be behind them."

article The bill accuses local rights groups of damaging the legitimacy of Israel's military by "branding IDF soldiers and commanders as war criminals".
It was sponsored by the hard-line party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
It follows other recent initiatives from the Israeli right, like requiring an oath of loyalty from non-Jews.
The motion to establish the commission of inquiry will now go to parliament's House Committee for debate, ahead of a full vote before the Knesset.
MK Fania Kirshenbaum - of Mr Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party - who submitted the proposal, accused human rights groups of branding Israeli soldiers as war criminals.

"These groups provide material to the Goldstone commission [which investigated the 2008-2009 Gaza offensive] and are behind the indictments lodged against Israeli officers and officials around the world," Ms Kirshenbaum said.
A series of arrest warrants for Israeli politicians and military officials have been issued in the last few years, particularly by pro-Palestinian groups in European countries.
The 41-17 vote brought a storm of protest from local rights groups, including Acri, Btselem, Adalah and the Hotline for Migrant Workers.
"Persecution and attempts at silencing will not stop us. In a democracy, criticism of the government is not only legitimate - it is essential," said a statement from Btselem, one of the organisations named in the decision.
The Welfare and Social Services Minister, Isaac Herzog, called it a "political witch hunt" suited to "shady regimes" that would damage Israel's international standing, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Israel "must be a light unto the world in terms of freedom of speech and freedom to express beliefs, and reject proposals that have the scent of McCarthyism," Mr Herzog said, referring to the 1950s communist witch hunt led by US Senator Joseph McCarthy.

article Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement that the men's contracts were not renewed when they ended in April.
However, it also said there were "no grounds to justify criminal proceedings" in the case.
The sports ministry had claimed last week that women players were forced to perform sexual favours to keep their places in the team.
Sri Lanka Cricket has not addressed this claim directly, referring instead to "the unsatisfactory situation that prevailed in the selection... and widely prevalent perceptions of favouritism and bias".
The body said that two of the officials concerned had committed "a few incidents of sexual harassment" but that "there was no evidence of any physical intimacy".
A third man had committed "incidents of improper conduct... which did not amount to sexual harassment".

Yu Tamura's conversion of Amanaki Lotoahea's 76th-minute try almost earned Japan an historic draw in a thrilling international in Cardiff.
Wales had led by 11 points in the second half after tries by Dan Lydiate, Jamie Roberts and Sam Warburton.
Wings Akihito Yamada and Kenki Fukuoka were Japan's other try-scorers.
Leigh Halfpenny scored 15 points with the boot and Japan number eight Amanaki Mafi was named man-of-the-match after a tireless and powerful display.
But it is the 23-year-old Ospreys number 10 Davies who will dominate the headlines after keeping his cool to nail his drop-goal left-footed from 30 metres in only his second international.
It was a rare moment of clarity in a Welsh performance punctuated by errors and a lack of tactical control.
Japan, with fly-half Tamura kicking superbly and Mafi simply magnificent, were worth a draw and were visibly disappointed at the final whistle.
The visitors' refusal to buckle in the face of superior Welsh possession was aided by Wales' unhappy knack of offering up points after scoring themselves.
Twice in the second half Rob Howley's team made a hash of restarts to let Japan back into the game and when Lotoahea juggled Mafi's pass to score his team's third try, it looked as though that would cost Wales dear.
Japan might even have won the game after robbing Wales of possession in the final minutes to break clear, but paid the price when they were turned over and the Welsh drove back downfield.
Howley will be looking for more control against South Africa next week.

Wales made a shambolic start and were trailing by six points and down to 14 men inside eight minutes with Liam Williams in the sin-bin.
A period of relative calm mid-half saw the home team establish forward control and Lydiate's first international try and Roberts' charge from five metres appeared to have restored order.
But far from turning the screw up front, Wales played fast and loose and were punished before the interval when Yamada pounced on Gareth Anscombe's speculative pass and raced 60 yards to score between the posts.
It was the same story after the break, with Warburton's try after great work by Alun Wyn Jones appearing to put Wales in control.
But Japan served up the try of the match through Fukuoka and then a thrilling finish after their third score.
Happily for Wales, Davies kept his head when those around him were losing theirs.

Amanaki Lelei Mafi was tireless in defence and a nuisance with the ball. What more can you ask of a number eight?
Former Wales captain Martyn Williams:
"Wales are way off it. You can't gloss over that. It was a dire performance. Wales were so slow and pedestrian.
"It is a win but a real poor performance."
Wales finish their autumn series with the visit of South Africa to Cardiff on 26 November and a chance to avenge their 2015 World Cup quarter-final defeat. Japan are off to France to play Fiji in Vannes.

A director's home address was revealed on the public register following a "mix-up" of documents being scanned.
Case correspondence was also mistakenly scanned onto the register.
A new personnel system also allowed staff access to information on the duration of colleagues' sickness absences.
Companies House, which currently employs 904 people in Cardiff and registers the information companies are legally required to supply, said it had "an incident process in place that all staff adhere to" when a breach of data protection law happens.
In January, a High Court judge ruled that a mistake by Companies House caused a 124-year-old south Wales company to go into administration.

article Francois Hollande said it would not be finalised before Barack Obama left office later this year.
Meanwhile, Germany's economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said it had no chance of being agreed before the US presidential election in November.
The Americans were unwilling to compromise with Europe, he said.
Mr Gabriel, who said over the weekend that the talks had in effect failed, also questioned whether the deal had any chance after the election.
"But if the Americans don't move towards the Europeans, then Europe can't agree to a 'TTIP light'. And with this, the project - at least how it was all planned for this year - has failed," he said.
The US and the European Union have been negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, also known as TTIP, for three years. Both sides had aimed to agree a deal this year.
TTIP aims to reduce or remove a wide range of barriers to transatlantic trade and investment, but has proved controversial in both Europe and America.
A spokesman for the US trade chief told German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday that talks on TTIP were progressing.
President Hollande said in a speech to French diplomats that France wanted to "see things as they are".
"These discussions cannot result in an agreement by the end of the year. The negotiations have bogged down, the positions have not been respected, the imbalance is obvious," he added.
The French leader's comments followed a call by trade minister Matthias Fekl to end negotiations, which he said no longer had political support in France because US negotiators "give nothing or just crumbs".
He wanted a "clear, clean, definitive stop" to the talks, which could resume if wider EU-US trade relations improved.
Mr Fekl said France would ask the European Commission to suspend the talks when trade ministers meet in Slovakia next month.
Italy's trade minister said that a TTIP deal would be reached, but the talks would take longer than expected.
Carlo Calenda said that "TTIP will be sealed - it is inevitable", adding that it was essential for Italian exporters.
The minister admitted it would be difficult to reach a deal before Mr Obama left office, but added: "We have to carry on. This accord is essential for Italy."

article The British star famous for playing Nelson Mandela and starring in The Wire, is reportedly being considered for the next 007.
The Daily Beast is reporting there was leaked email from Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion pictures group.
It is reported the contents said: "Idris should be the next Bond.
Pascal was thought to be emailing Elizabeth Cantillon, the former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures - which distributes the Bond franchise.
There is no confirmation from Idris Elba or from Sony Pictures that the actor will take over to be the next 007.
The 42-year-old has previously said he would play Bond.
During a Reddit AMA in September he responded to a fan's question of whether he'd be willing to take the role, writing: "Yes, if it was offered to me, absolutely."
Daniel Craig, who is currently filming his fourth appearance as Bond in new release Spectre, is signed on to do one more film.
"I've been trying to get out of this from the very moment I got into it. But they won't let me go, and I've agreed to do a couple more," he told Rolling Stone two years ago.
Spectre is due for release in November next year.

article Tim Hughes said he listed the Series One classic on eBay to spark a discussion about its history.
The once iconic 4X4 does not have its original engine and is covered in rust.
Land Rover Historian Roger Crathorne said: "It's ruined. It's more likely to fetch £2,000 than £200,000."
He said the car's chassis number and paperwork confirmed it was the first diesel to be made - but without its original engine it was not in its complete form.
"It's interesting that it's the first diesel off the production line and it's got its original factory registration. But it's not got its original engine and in the state it's in, the price is way out," he added.
Mr Hughes, managing director of Motiv Trailers in Craven Arms, south Shropshire, said he listed the rickety off-roader at £200,000 to generate interest in its past.
"What is it worth? I don't know. But its value is in its history," he said.
Dave Scott, secretary of Warwickshire and West Midlands Land Rover Club, said: "The seller believes this to be the first production 88inch 2 litre diesel. The chassis number certainly supports this."
But he questioned when the car was registered.
"According to Heynes purchase and restoration manual, the diesel was not introduced until June 1957.
"At this time Land Rover could virtually sell everything it produced so creating a five-month stockpile seems odd," said Mr Scott.
Mr Hughes said he had received inquiries from collectors as far afield as Portugal and Germany.
He said: "For every email I've had from someone interested in it there have been four from people saying 'you're off your rocker, you're never going to get that for it.'
"But I've looked at what other historic vehicles like this have gone for over the past 18 months and left the price open. If it exceeds £200,000 then I would be extremely surprised.
"But if someone came forward who wanted to restore it for a price I thought was fair I would sell it."
The up-for-grabs vehicle's design is the basis for the iconic model which became known as the Defender in the 90s.
The last Defender was made at the Solihull factory on 29 January after Jaguar Land Rover discontinued it.
The car's logbook shows it was registered in 1957 and sold 10 years later to Albert George Dyer in Handsworth, Birmingham.
The same owner moved to Adleymoor, Bucknell, Shropshire, in 1975.
Mr Hughes said the robust off-roader was used on a farm until 1982 but had been out of work ever since. He bought the car as a restoration project but does not have the time to dedicate to it.
"I've had people calling up and telling me bits of information about it which has been really useful.
"I'd love someone to come forward and say 'I know that car, it belonged to my dad, here's a picture of it on the beach."

article Jared Kushner said all of his "actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events" of the campaign.
Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia.
He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy.
He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been "fully transparent in providing all the requested information".
"Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts," he said.
Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.
In a statement to both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were "hardly any" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were "perhaps four".
He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton.
Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was "time not well-spent".
Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided.
In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.
He says the first form, a "rough draft that still had many omissions", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months "in the normal course".
Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed.
Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is "happy" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal.
He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign.
Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals.
He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent.
The incomplete security form was the result of a "miscommunication" with an assistant who submitted it too soon.
Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk.
President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.
He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: "As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!"
Russia has also denied any involvement.

article The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working "at the hardest job in the world".
After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea.
Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll.
Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: "The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform.
"They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers."
Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying "look at my money" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth.
And the men wore open-necked shirts as "however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland," he added
Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when "thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever".
At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was "the largest fishing port in the world".
The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because "everything was in the melting pot".
"Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, " he added.
The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars.
Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own.
The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore.
The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland.
This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull.
Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit.
The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed.
Mr Ludlam said the ports had "always been at daggers drawn" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride.
He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed.
The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered.
Mr Ludlam said: "Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back."
The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby

article Mr Buhari, who was elected in March partly on a promise to tackle corruption and insecurity, vowed to select competent and clean individuals.
But when the much-anticipated list was released, many were disappointed, asking whether the wait had been worth it, and whether those selected were the best in the country.
Some say the list is full of old and recycled politicians who have been part of Nigeria's problems.
The youths who worked tirelessly during his campaign have also been disappointed because the average age in the cabinet is 52. Some women's groups have also voiced their anger that there are just six females on the list.
The 36 names approved by MPs - but yet to be given portfolios - include five former governors, nine lawyers, four former senators, three academics, two medical doctors, two retired soldiers and a clergyman.
The combination of experienced politicians and technocrats shows that the president was trying to balance his choice - rewarding party loyalists, while also selecting some professionals.
His hands were also tied by the constitutional requirement to choose at least one person from each of Nigeria's 36 states.
His supporters say the list shows he is committed to fulfilling his election promises, adding that age and gender do not matter at this stage because the country needs to be rescued urgently.
Here are seven interesting characters to watch in the cabinet:
It is not surprising that Mr Fashola made the list.
His achievements during his tenure as governor of Lagos state - Nigeria's commercial capital - makes him a good asset.
He is credited with bringing an element of order to the chaotic city through massive infrastructure development that included demolishing illegal structures to pave the way for new road projects.
Nigeria in pictures: Lagos facelift
As a senior lawyer and experienced administrator, it won't be surprising if he is asked to head the justice ministry.
The president has promised to root out corruption and bribery allegations that tainted the image of Nigeria's judicial system.
The former ExxonMobil executive vice-chairman was appointed by President Buhari in August to head the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), an organisation vital to Africa's largest economy but notorious for corruption and mismanagement.
Many analysts believe his appointment has started to yield results.
It is surprising that he has now been asked to join the cabinet and is very likely to be appointed a minister in the oil ministry.
This means a new NNPC head may have to be appointed.
Even though the president has said he will oversee the ministry himself, most of the work and reforms he plans to carry out will be handled by Mr Kachikwu.
It will be interesting to see how he will help Mr Buhari clean up the oil sector and recover the mind-boggling sums he said had been stolen.
Does Nigeria run better without a cabinet?
Buhari's to-do list
Is Buhari a changed man?
She is a well-known technocrat within and outside Nigeria. She has more than 30 years of experience in the field of development, including as Nigeria's presidential adviser on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
She was credited with designing and developing several government projects aimed at reducing poverty.
Before joining the cabinet, Ms Mohammed was the Special Adviser to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on post-2015 development planning.
Her eloquence and globally-exposed experience in development and management could be an asset to the government if correctly exploited.
He is the most controversial of all the appointees even though his inclusion did not come as surprise.
As President Buhari's campaign director, many Nigerians see Mr Amaechi's appointment as pay-back for the role he played in the president's victory during the election.
However, his choice has been heavily criticised after he was indicted by Rivers state's panel of inquiry for allegedly enriching himself during his eight-year tenure as the state's governor.
He denied all the allegations and said they were politically motivated. He also took the commission to court.
Opposition MPs tried to block his appointment but the ruling party used its majority to get him through.
As Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff between 2008 and 2010, he led a successful campaign against militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
After he was sacked, the militants regrouped in 2011. Since then, thousands of people have been killed and the insurgency has spread to neighbouring countries.
Tackling the group is one of Mr Buhari's top priorities, so it will be interesting to see how Mr Dambazzau will tackle the conflict now, assuming he is asked to head the ministry of defence as expected.
She is an economist and financial expert who was educated and worked in the UK before going back to Nigeria to serve as a commissioner of finance in the south-western state of Ogun.
Many expect her to be posted to the finance ministry.
During her presentation to the Senate, she said funds allocated for various projects are being diverted and identified ways to stop this happening.
She also said the country cannot afford to continue spending 78% of its budget on paying civil servants' salaries and other ongoing costs.
It will be interesting to see how the financial markets, investors and ordinary Nigerians will react to her appointment and whether she will be able to transform the country's struggling economy.
As a veteran politician with four decades of experience, Mr Ogbe, 68, is known to be independent-minded and self-willed and has served in several previous governments.
Many remember him for his public row with ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005, when he was chairman of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party.
He was forced to resign from the position after accusing Mr Obasanjo of interfering in party affairs.
Mr Ogbe is an experienced farmer who is expected to be appointed to lead the vital agriculture ministry.
Nigeria has a vast tracts of land that analysts say, if used properly, could create jobs for the country's army of unemployed youths and reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil.
Nigerians will be hoping that he is able to bring this theory to reality.
summary Nigeria's president Muhammadu Buhari has been accused of appointing a "

article Written off by his rivals and the media after suffering a drubbing at the hands of Narendra Modi's resurgent BJP in last May's general elections, India's most famous anti-corruption campaigner has bounced back.
The former tax inspector took on a ruling party at the peak of its power and felled it in the national capital. For sheer symbolism, Mr Kejriwal's victory in Delhi is astounding, the proverbial David slaying the all-mighty Goliath. The scale of the BJP's defeat makes Mr Kejriwal's win truly extraordinary.
How did India's most powerful and richest party - with its charismatic leader, fabled organisational skills and political nous - get it so wrong?
A little over a year ago, the BJP picked up 32 of 70 seats in hung elections to the Delhi state assembly. Last May, it took all seven of the capital's parliamentary seats, as well as bordering the capital. It rolled out the heavy artillery against Mr Kejriwal in Delhi - Mr Modi himself led the campaign, helped by nearly two dozen federal ministers and 120 MPs. But to no avail. "This is not just a defeat for the BJP, this is a decimation in a high-profile election," says Swapan Dasgupta, a columnist who is no admirer of Mr Kejriwal.
For one, Mr Kejriwal launched his campaign to regain Delhi as early as last July. Most believe the anti-corruption campaigner's masterstroke was telling people that he was sorry for quitting in haste after a chaotic 49-day stint in power following an impressive debut in the December 2013 state polls. He went to every neighbourhood and slum to beg forgiveness. "We have made a mistake", he told people, "but we haven't sinned." In a country where politicians are increasingly seen as aloof and arrogant, Mr Kejriwal's atonement worked wonders. Every comeback needs true believers, and Delhi's voters believed him.
Mr Kejriwal also drove a positive - and populist - campaign focusing on Delhi. The BJP surprised many by running a personal campaign against Mr Kejriwal. It was, most said, bound to backfire.
The fact that Mr Kejriwal's party won more than half of the popular vote - the highest by any party in Delhi ever - also points to the fact that his supporters transcended class and religion:  the poor and the minorities appear to have backed him, and a large section of the middle class, which had deserted him, returned. One young professional, who voted for the BJP in May, told me he was voting for Mr Kejriwal this time because he was unnerved by Mr Modi's failure to gag his party's radical fringe.
But more importantly, say analysts like Neerja Chowdhury, "voters in Delhi also reacted to the BJP's arrogance of power". The BJP is a cadre-based party with deep roots in Delhi. Analysts say voters did not take kindly to former policewoman Kiran Bedi being introduced at the last-minute as the BJP's chief ministerial candidate.  Also, Mr Kejriwal represents what many say is a refreshing brand of unostentatious politics, far removed from the flashy political culture associated with both the BJP and Congress. "Hope has returned," said AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.
It won't be easy. Mr Kejriwal faces considerable challenges in governing one of the world's megacities. Although petty corruption was kept in check, his shambolic 49-day government did not inspire much confidence. Delhi is a complex city-state where 40% of the people are migrants and faces serious problems with water, electricity, housing, air pollution and choking traffic. Can Mr Kejriwal shed his activist mode and make the kind of compromises that come with governance? Analyst Ashish Nandy says the AAP's win is a "return to politics of populism". But just how much populism can Delhi - and India - afford?
For Mr Modi and the BJP, defeat marks the end of the honeymoon period and they are stripped of their aura of invincibility.
Now, fractious - and largely discredited - opposition parties across the country will be emboldened and begin believing they can take on the BJP. That will be easier said than done. Congress, which has drawn a complete blank for the first time in Delhi, appears to be facing an existential crisis. "This is a big morale booster for India's opposition parties," says Neerja Chowdhury. But it will take a lot more effort to translate that spirit into votes against the BJP across the country.
summary The BJP's slain leader, BJP leader Amit Shah, has

article But Labour and backbench Tory MPs accused ministers of breaking a promise for a vote on the warrant itself.
The debate ended early when Labour lost its attempt to use a rare Parliamentary procedure to postpone the decision.
Earlier, Commons Speaker John Bercow said people would be "contemptuous" of the government's tactics.
BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said there were "scenes of chaos" in the Commons chamber.
The government opted out of all 133 EU police and criminal justice measures measures in 2013, a decision that will take effect on 1 December.
However, ministers plan to rejoin 35 of the measures, including the European Arrest Warrant, before that deadline.
Supporters, including the government and law enforcement agencies, say the warrant is a vital tool to protect the UK and bring criminals to justice across EU borders.
However, critics - including some Conservative MPs - say the European Arrest Warrant is overused and a threat to the liberties of Britons and the sovereignty of the UK.
Commons clashes erupted after Mr Bercow ruled the debate and vote would not cover the arrest warrant.
Mrs May said only 11 of the EU justice measures needed to be voted on and "transposed" into UK law. But she told MPs the Commons' verdict on these measures would be treated as a vote on the whole package of 35.
The debate came to an end when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper invoked a rare procedure to ask that the "question be not now put", asking Mrs May to come back with a motion which specifically included the warrant.
Faced with a potential backbench rebellion, Prime Minister David Cameron returned early from the Lord Mayor's Banquet dressed in a white tie, while other Tories were urgently called back to Parliament to take part in the vote.
When Mrs Cooper's motion was defeated by 272 to 229 - a majority of just 43 - the vote on the EU justice measures took place immediately, with MPs voting in favour by 464 to 38.
The government's approach was criticised by Mr Bercow and Conservative MPs.
"There is not today to be a vote on the specific matter of membership of the European Arrest Warrant," Mr Bercow told MPs.
The Speaker said he himself had expected a vote on the warrant, saying it was a "sorry saga" and that "the House should not be put in that position".
"A commitment is a commitment to be honoured," he said, "rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice".
He said the public expected "straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous, and I use the word advisedly, of what is not straightforward dealing".
Q&A: European Arrest Warrant
Conservative MP Sir Richard Shepherd said the government's behaviour had been "sly", while fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg called it "underhand".
Tory MP Bill Cash, who chairs the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, said: "This is a disgraceful way of going about a very, very important matter. It is tainted with chicanery, it is not the way this Parliament should be treated."
Despite the speaker's ruling, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons the vote would be on all 35 of the EU crime and justice measures.
And Mrs May said the government was not legally required to bring the measures to the House. Transposing some into UK law would usually be done through a special committee of MPs, she said.
When the main debate got under way, Mrs May said she understood concerns over the warrant but said she had legislated to make it "better and safer".
Setting out the case to retain it, she told MPs more than 95% of people extradited from the UK were foreign nationals, including suspects wanted for 124 murders, more than 100 rapes, nearly 500 serious assaults and seven terrorism cases.
The home secretary said "harmful individuals" could walk free and escape justice without the "vital" regulations, saying the process had to be completed by 1 December to avoid an "operational gap".
But Mrs Cooper, who said she supported the European Arrest Warrant, nonetheless said Mrs May had presided over a Parliamentary "shambles".
"You have effectively said ministers are just going to make it up because the Speaker has been very clear that this does not include a vote on the European Arrest Warrant, you are just going to reinterpret it in any way you choose," she said.

article Consider the roadblocks. Bobby Lennox - so shy as a kid he was embarrassed to play football in other people's company.
John Clark - his young life ruined by the death of his father in a railway accident.
Stevie Chalmers - so sick from tuberculosis-meningitis in his late teens and early 20s that he was given three weeks to live.
Jock Stein - left his job as Celtic reserve team manager on account of his religion, the Parkhead board telling him that as a Protestant he had gone as far as he could possibly go at the club.
Stein was in tears that day. So say a number of his former players in a documentary - Glasgow 1967 - about the Lions and the city they came from, to be aired on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST.

It's part football film, part social history, part dream come true, a Cinderella tale to match any Cinderella tale the global game has ever produced. So much has been said and written about them. A quick online search shows that at least 32 books, two plays and a novel have been penned in their honour.
In this past week, the newspapers have been full of supplements, fine journalism that came at the story from new angles. There are other documentaries available, there are CDs, there's a Lisbon Lions cushion, if you fancy it, there's a Lions tea towel, a Lions iPad cover, a Lions mouse mat.
On Sunday at Celtic Park, 60,000 people created a stunning visual display that evoked their legend. On Thursday, thousands more will gather at the SSE Hydro to do it all again, this time in the company of Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Alex Ferguson, Martin O'Neill, Gordon Strachan and others.
The story never gets old, the appetite never sated.
There's a simple and lovely moment close to the beginning of Glasgow 1967 when Willie Wallace, now living in Australia, revisits Celtic Park and wanders about its corridors. "Fifty years and they're still going on about it," he says with a smile on his face that spoke of pride, no doubt, but also amusement at all the fuss.
These lads didn't do fuss. They didn't consider themselves celebrities, just footballers, guys who adored the game and who were blessed with a talent and a hunger to succeed.
On that May day, Jimmy Johnstone, hot to trot, stared over at the bronzed athletes of Inter Milan as they took to the field in Lisbon and said to Bertie Auld: "Look at them, wee man, they're like film stars!"
And Auld's answer cut to the heart of the greatness that was about to show itself. "Aye, but can they PLAY?"
The Lions could play on a carpet and they could play on a ploughed field just as fluently. There's footage of them training on muck, not grass. That was the way of it. That was the norm. There's more footage of what tough economic times they lived in and yet amid the gloom this thing of beauty emerged.

The documentary is called Glasgow 1967 for a reason, for what shines through is the character not just of the players and their manager, but of their supporters and their city.
Humour courses through the narrative of Lisbon like a fast-running river. The emotion and the hilarity of the supporters elevates what happened to almost mythical proportions.
The fans are here in numbers. Ian Martin making a cup of tea in his kitchen and telling of the day he left for Lisbon in a Mini Cooper as part of a three-car cavalcade. "One of the boys in the other motor lost his suitcase even before he got to Bishopbriggs. It fell off the roof-rack."
There's Jimmy Quinn telling of an uncomfortable conversation with his fiancee. "I said, 'See this getting married carry-on, saving up for an engagement ring an' that, I want to go to the cup final. End of story'. She wasn't a bit pleased."
John Cowan was on a flight out of Glasgow that touched down uncomfortably close to kick-off-time. The doors of the plane swung open. The airline had no steps in place and the 19-year-old John didn't have the luxury of waiting - so he jumped.
"I sat down on the ledge and went for it," he recalls. "There was guys coming behind me. Dropping, dropping, dropping. And we started running towards the terminal."

God knows where Charlie Fryars and his mates were at this point, but Fryars' personal odyssey is a glorious illustration of the fact that, in many ways, there were more than 11 Lions in Lisbon.
Charlie tells part of his tale in the documentary, the full comic brilliance of it being told in a piece he has written for the ByTheMinute Celtic platform online. It begins when his mate, Gerry Loney, rings him up and offers him a seat in his Austin Cambridge, bound for Lisbon.
Charlie and Gerry plus Laurence Donnelly, John Hughes and Jim McDaid met at the Admiral Bar in Waterloo Street in Glasgow and hit the road. They had almost 2,000 miles to drive and three days to do it. That meant no hotel stops and as few comfort breaks as possible. Their first destination was Southampton to catch the boat to Cherbourg. They got as far as Lockerbie when the car broke down.
The explorers made the ferry, got some sleep on the four-hour crossing, drove down the Cotentin Peninsula and into Nantes where they had some beers in a bar near the station - and another kip. Not Charlie, though. Charlie was busy falling in love with a 19-year-old waitress called Ghislaine.
After half an hour, Ghislaine threw her arms around him and gave him a kiss. "She wanted my Celtic scarf and I said to her, 'No, we need it for hanging out the window." What greater love can one man have for his football club than to refuse to lay down his scarf for the gorgeous Ghislaine?
On they went - a thousand miles to go and only 33 hours left. Their exhaust pipe went near La Rochelle, but they got help and found a new one. They had a moment of weakness near San Sebastian, but they pulled back from the brink and carried on.
They came to the Portuguese border and it was closed for the night. The guards saw their colours and waved them through.
They made the kick-off, celebrated thunderously and then turned around and drove home. They were seven days on the road there and back, a whole week sleeping in the Austin Cambridge; unwashed, weary, but with memories that will sustain them for the rest of their lives. They didn't play that day in Lisbon, but what is that if not footballing heroism?
"When I got home," says Charlie, "I got my Celtic scarf and I parcelled it up and I wrote a letter to Ghislaine at Bar de la Garde, Nantes... I never heard from her." On that 4,000 mile trek, two happy endings was too much to hope for.
One was enough, more than enough. In this film, you marvel anew not just at what the Lions achieved, not just the lengths that 10,000 Celtic people went to in order to see them achieve it, but how powerful that achievement remains to this day, the magnitude of it passed on from father to son through the generations.
Glasgow 1967: The Lisbon Lions will be shown on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 on Wednesday 24 May. It can be seen in other parts of the United Kingdom at 23:20.

article The Number Four Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Henan province was partially demolished on Thursday amid a land dispute, Xinhua news agency said.
Hospital staff told reporters equipment worth over $600,000 was damaged.
The case has sparked outrage in China, where forced demolitions are common.
Doctors told local media that several men in camouflage uniforms showed up at the hospital, in Huiji district, on Thursday, and began bulldozing the building.
Liu Chunguang, director of the hospital's radiology department, told Xinhua news agency he was examining a patient when the demolition took place.
"A gaping hole appeared - the patient was half-scared to death, and ran out."
Meanwhile, hospital official Yuan Fang told Xinhua that radiology equipment had been damaged and the hospital had had to suspend its activities, forcing many patients to switch hospitals.
"Burying the bodies of patients in rubble is extremely disrespectful to the deceased," he added.
The local Huiji district government said in a statement that the hospital's CT room and morgue were on land designated for a road expansion project, and that it had asked the hospital to dismantle the rooms themselves several times.
The hospital was evacuated prior to demolition, and there were no casualties, the statement added.
However, hospital officials said three doctors and a patient were in the building at the time of demolition, and that some hospital workers were injured when they tried to stop the demolition, Jinghua news reported.

article In Scotland, 351.4mm of rainfall was recorded with Cluanie Inn, Ross and Cromarty, the wettest place (768.4mm)
It was also an unusually warm month, with temperatures about 2.7C above the long term average.
Provisional figures also reveal 2015 was the second wettest year on record in Scotland. Only 2011 was wetter.
Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: "It fits in with most people's perceptions that in the latter part of the year it was particularly wet.
"There were a a lot of fronts approaching the UK from the Azores and the Tropics. Warmer air brings moisture and that translates into more rainfall."
The average temperature (including both day and night) was 5.4C, making it the fifth warmest on record. The long term average (1910-1981) for Scotland in December is 2.8C.
Annual rainfall for 2015 was 1869.2mm, only beaten by the 1886.4mm recorded in 2011.
By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst
The Met Office says there is a direct link between the warmth and the record rains that brought widespread floods across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England.
Storms propelled by the jet stream were mainly to blame, it says, with contributions from the El Nino weather phenomenon and man-made climate change.
December was something of a freak month, it acknowledges. Climate change has raised UK temperatures by around 1C (1.8F) so far, so it will be many decades before this level of extreme weather becomes the new winter norm, it says.
Other scientists say that with climate change, there will be no "normal" weather.

Scotland was one of the few countries in the UK to experience regular frosts. The UK as a whole saw just 2.6 days of air frost which is eight days below the long term average.
Mr Madge said it was too early to deduce long term trends but he added: "When you look at the wettest years, five out of six for the UK as a whole have been since 2000."

article Praveen Sood told the BBC that police officers had reviewed footage from almost 70 CCTV cameras.
But he said police were looking into isolated incidents in other parts of the city that night.
A number of women have told the media they were assaulted by groups of men.
Some have described being surrounded by unruly mobs, and being groped and harassed.
Praveen Sood said police had responded to footage from a member of the public who said a woman had been attacked by two men on a motorbike near his home.
"We had a look at it. We saw it was quite a clear case of serious molestation. We didn't wait, we didn't even bother with whom the victim is. We didn't ask her, we wanted to protect her identity. We have registered a criminal case," he said.
But, Mr Sood said, the alleged attacks in the centre of Bangalore never took place. The incidents are said to have occurred in the MG road area as a crowd of 10,000 people gathered there to see in the New Year on Saturday.
He said the footage being used by the media to make allegations of mass molestation was actually that of the melee that had resulted from a baton charge by police who were trying to disperse the crowds.
"People ran, there were a lot of girls there. There was panic, there was a melee, they got separated, they were cryingâ€¦ so that 30 seconds of confusion is being projected as a mass molestation. I categorically say that nothing of that sort has happened," he said.
Six people held on Wednesday were detained over an incident in a different part of the city, he said.
Mr Sood said that despite a public appeal, no one had come forward to record a complaint of molestation or harassment.
He said, however, that he had seen some women telling the media that they were touched inappropriately and that the police were ready to treat those statements as complaints and begin an investigation.
One woman, a marketing professional who asked to be identified only as Pooja, told the BBC that she was assaulted both in a bar and as she walked to meet a friend.
Even when she formed a circle with another group of girls to try and walk to safety, "there were guys who were trying to touch here and there", she said.
"There was not a single face you could make out or who was doing it," she said, pointing out how difficult it would be to file a complaint.
Another woman, photographer Chaitali Wasnik, told the BBC she was groped in another part of Bangalore on New Year's Eve.
She said a man approached her and tried to grab her breasts, but ran away when she fought back.
"I want the girls to know that you can come forward and speak it out, whatever you have faced," she told the BBC. "You don't have to be scared."

article The Brazilian town of Tabatinga vies for size and importance with Colombia's Leticia. While on the Peruvian side - across the mighty Amazon River - is the tiny hamlet of Santa Rosa. Together they form a unique 'triple town' known as Tres Fronteiras.
Though far from the glamour cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - the engines of Brazil's economic miracle - Tabatinga is experiencing a period of extraordinary growth. This is a city with three universities, a deep-water port, and an international airport - all built within the last five years to serve a population that has doubled in size since 2000.

Tabatinga is now more than a match for its neighbour Leticia, though the capital of Colombia's Amazonas state has also changed beyond recognition in recent years.
Three decades ago, this was a key staging post in Pablo Escobar's narco-trafficking network. The man who engineered this network for Escobar - Evaristo Porras - built his personal mansion here, painstakingly reproducing the Carrington Family home from the TV series Dynasty.
The mansion is now a ruin, though others have been turned into boutique hotels. Tourism is booming in Leticia, and helping to fill the void left by the collapse of the cartels with honest dollars.
The Peruvian side of the trio is very much the junior partner. With a population of only around 600, Santa Rosa is not much more than a single street. There's a handful of cevicherias, or fish restaurants, where tourists staying in Tabatinga or Leticia come to sample Peru's famous cuisine.
But no running water, electricity or other basic services. This may soon change as the Brazilian economic miracle sucks in more and more cheap imports from Peru.
Among these imports is illegal timber. Deforestation rates on the Brazilian side of the border have fallen dramatically in recent years, according to government figures. But rates in Peru have increased - leading some to accuse Brazil of merely outsourcing the problem to its neighbours.
Meanwhile the cocaine trade hasn't gone away, and there are rumours of a new strain of the drug - allegedly genetically modified - that's able to grow in lowland areas like the Amazon basin as well as in its native highland environment.
Together with illegal distilleries, drug smuggling and deforestation threaten the survival of indigenous communities living in the forest surrounding our square mile. With hardwoods fetching up to $3,000 (Â£1,850)  (per tree, and a kilo of cocaine worth about the same, the temptations are immense.
To protect themselves and their forest, the Huitoto people have taken policing into their own hands with the formation of the Indigenous Guard. Armed with sticks, they patrol the forest and report any wrongdoing to the police.
But the nature of the territory does not make things easy for them - with its thousands of small rivers and streams, our square mile is a smuggler's paradise, and Tabatinga is still thought to be the main point of entry of cocaine into Brazil. Behind the development success story, the old sources of wealth are still going strong.
summary The Amazon is a tense region with rivals in Brazil and Peru.

article Initial reports spoke of two bombs but it gradually became clear that there was a single blast, possibly in the third carriage of the train.
Dozens of people were wounded, and seven people died in the immediate aftermath. Another victim died on the way to hospital and two more fatalities were confirmed later in hospital. The wounded were taken to four city hospitals.
Although the explosion happened in between the two stations the driver continued to Tekhnologichesky Institut to enable victims to be helped more easily. Russia's investigative committee said this decision may have helped prevent further losses.
Early indications were that the bomb was an improvised device made out of the explosive TNT and was possibly hidden in a briefcase close to the carriage doors. Pictures from the scene showed mangled doors and bodies on the floor of the platform.
Minutes later another device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. That was safely defused and reports said it contained 1kg of TNT, more than used in the original blast.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the blast as a "terrorist act" and Russia's investigative committee said it was opening a criminal inquiry under article 205 of the criminal code which refers specifically to terrorist acts. The committee said that all other possibilities were being investigated too.
No organisation has said it carried out the attack but a local website Fontanka.ru and Ren TV published a photo captured by CCTV cameras of a bearded man wearing a black hat and coat. It is not known if he survived the blast.
At the time of the explosion President Vladimir Putin was just outside Russia's second city, meeting Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at the Konstantin palace in Strelna.
The St Petersburg metro was shut down and three days of mourning declared. Traffic in surrounding streets and in much of central St Petersburg was brought to a standstill for hours, and volunteers offered lifts via social media to people trying to get home.
Moscow authorities said they were taking additional security measures on the Russian capital's metro, and at stations, airports and other public places.
Russia's transport infrastructure has been targeted before.

article The country's first president of indigenous origin faces a tough challenge after 10 years in power.
He called a referendum to ratify constitutional amendments approved by parliament last year.
Mr Morales says he needs a third term for social reforms but the opposition says the change is undemocratic.
"On Sunday we will win big," Mor Morales said during the campaign. "The people will decide and there will be a lot to celebrate."
Mr Morales, an indigenous Aymara and former coca leaf producer, took office in January 2006.
His second term ends in 2020 but he will be able to run for another term in 2019 and serve until 2025 if the referendum is approved.
Mr Morales has already been elected three times but argues that the first term does not count because a new constitution was approved in 2009, re-founding the country as Plurinational State of Bolivia.
Despite a drop in the international price of oil and natural gas, the Bolivian economy has performed well in the past 10 years, growing on average 5% a year.
The government's socialist policies have also been successful in reducing extreme poverty.
But recent allegations that Mr Morales used his influence to favour a Chinese construction firm in Bolivia have damaged his approval ratings.
A former girlfriend of Mr Morales, Gabriela Zapata, holds an important position in the company, CAMC, which has secured more than $500m (Â£350m) in contracts with the Bolivian government
Mr Morales rejected the allegations and said he had nothing to hide. He ordered an investigation into how the contracts were awarded.

article The Android store will abandon the low/medium/high maturity classifications it has used until now and switch to a system run by an outside body.
As increasing numbers of youngsters are left alone to play with smartphones and tablets, the move will allow Google to show it takes its responsibilities seriously.
But there remains the potential for confusion - and controversy.
Google says it wants to reassure parents that apps are properly labelled by bringing in the experts rather than relying on developers to self-certify their products, as had been the case until now.
Rather than use its own proprietary classifications, it will offer parents and children labels similar to those already used to provide guidance about the suitability of boxed video games for different age groups, which should be relatively familiar.
A relatively new body called the International Age Rating Coalition.
It was founded two years ago, but its members have been in the age classification business for decades.
Instead of a centralised office issuing a single global age rating for each app, Iarc's five participants each give their own grades, taking into account local laws and different cultural sensitivities.
So, apps that contain nudity, violence, references to gambling and drugs and other potentially unsuitable material, will be ranked differently depending on where in the world a user's account is based.
The bodies involved are:
Generic ratings are assigned to territories without a participating authority.
If, for whatever reason, one or more of the rating authorities refuse to classify an app, it will not be distributed in the relevant countries.
Iarc says not.
Developers only have to fill in a single questionnaire about how their apps function and the content they contain.
The different bodies then share the information.
Makers of apps that don't contain content of their own - including calendars, calculators and other utilities - should be able to complete the process in less than a minute, the coalition's chairwoman Patricia Vance told the BBC. Even those involving more work shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes.
The system is automated, so the ratings should be spat out shortly after the answers are punched in.
However, Iarc promises there will be manual checks of the most popular apps and any which receive complaints from customers.
"The volume of apps in a storefront like Google Play is just enormous," explained Pegi's Dirk Bosmans.
"We can't follow the same [hands-on] approach that we do for boxed games, but we don't have to make the process as robust as there's no physical product here.
"If a physical product is mis-rated that's a logistical nightmare as you have to pull the boxes back from the shops and reprint them.
"With apps you can just say, 'That age seven rating should have been a 12,' and with a snap of the finger, reprogramme it."
Actually, Google Play isn't the first to throw its lot in with Iarc.
Mozilla's lesser-used Firefox Marketplace already depends on its rankings.
And the body says Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are also set to join.
Iarc would love to take over the iOS store's age ratings and says it has discussed the possibility with the iPhone-maker.
But for now, Apple has opted to retain its own system.
That could potentially be confusing for families using a mix of devices.
For example, Apple's guidelines state that an app depicting mild occurrences of cartoon-like violence should get a nine+ rating, but the ESRB allows the same type of product to be classed E, meaning suitable for everyone.
Likewise, Apple says apps including nudity should be limited to a 17+ audience, while Pegi says nudity is fine for the 3+ crowd if it's non-sexual and 16+ if erotic.
Apple declined to comment about its future plans.
Not quite.
The ratings are limited to an app's content and don't involve privacy issues.
So, Iarc's members would judge a storybook app, for instance, to be suitable for a pre-teen age group based solely on the innocuous plot it tells.
But it could still be problematic if it required the user to share data about their location, contacts, photos or other device use.
This is a real concern. Earlier this month, 29 privacy watchdogs across the globe announced they were investigating what information was being collected by some of the leading apps targeted at children because of fears that too much personal information was being recorded.
Apps containing user generated content that isn't moderated before publication pose a separate challenge.
The ESRB plans to give such products a "teen" rating, while Pegi will instead show an exclamation mark icon, indicating that further parental guidance is necessary.
Yes. But there are proposals to change this.
Some campaigners are pressing for an age-verification scheme that would let app stores confirm that young device-owners were old enough to download a product without needing to hold personal information about them on file.
This would involve a trusted third party carrying out the necessary ID checks and then vouching for the child's age at the point of purchase, explains Dr Rachel O'Connell, chief executive of the tech advisory service Trust Elevate.
If the child was flagged as being below Iarc's relevant age rating, she said, an email could be automatically sent to their parents asking for their permission.
While it might take years to get such an initiative up and running, the GSMA - which represents mobile operators - says other steps could be taken in the meantime.
It suggests age-restricted apps could pose children a series of challenging questions to try to catch out those attempting to pretend to be older than they are - such as requiring them to type in their date of birth - and only giving them one chance to get the answer right.
There are also existing parental control apps and settings in Android Lollipop that can be used to prevent unauthorised access to the marketplace and only allow children access to specific titles.

article The country is already a pioneer in the use of mobile money.
The government is looking to tap into that network by allowing mobile phone users to trade the government securities across their phones.
Kenyans can buy one of the bonds for as little as 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30; Â£23), the country's central bank said.
Kenya's banking system is fuelled by mobile payments.
The main provider of mobile transactions, M-Pesa - which is Swahili for money - has about 20 million users, and there are more than 100 times as many M-Pesa kiosks as there are cash machines in Kenya.
Finance Minister Henry Rotich said the government was initially making a limited offer of 150 million shillings to test the new bond before a bigger offer in June.
Kenya has borrowed heavily in the past four years to fund an ambitious construction programme, including roads and a new railway.
The bond, called M-Akiba, can be bought by phone users without any need for a bank account and pays an estimated interest of 10%.
Aly Khan Satchu, a financial analyst in Nairobi, told the BBC: "It's giving access to every Kenyan citizen to government securities.
"The idea of collecting nickel and dimes and aggregating them will be a source of potentially cheap money for the government.
"But I think ultimately it's a story about enfranchisement - allowing people with as little as $30 to invest in the capital markets. That's a good thing."
The country's central bank governor, Patrick Njoroge, said the bond would "dramatically improve the savings culture of our people".
Ronak Gadhia, an analyst at Exotix Partners, said he believed it was the first country to issue such bonds.
"And that is because no other country in the world has adopted mobile banking as much as Kenya has."
Kenya's mobile-traded government bond has been in the works since 2015, and was finally launched today.
For as little as $30, Kenyan mobile users can now lend to the government and get paid a tax-free interest of 10% every six months.
Even though the minimum requirement is very low, government bonds have always been the preserve of the well-to-do, and a high level of awareness will be required for less investment-savvy individuals to take this up.
The success of this bond would shake up financial services by giving small investors alternatives to low interest earning accounts in banks, mobile money wallets, and savings co-operatives.
Apart from encouraging people to save, the platform will provide the Kenyan government with a new source of cheap money that it intends to use to finance large infrastructure projects.
Currently, only 2% of government bonds in Kenya are bought and sold by individual investors.
summary Kenya is looking to use mobile phones to make its government securities more accessible to the public.

article Last week, UKIP's ruling body excluded one of the better known candidates to succeed Nigel Farage because his application missed by the deadline by 17 minutes.
Three members of the executive promptly resigned, one of them telling the BBC the party was in a fight for its very survival.
"There is a huge amount of confusion, flux and sadly infighting," Steven Woolfe, the excluded candidate, told me, as he pinned the blame on the executive.
Over at the Labour Party, the mood is, if anything, more poisonous.
After its National Executive imposed a retrospective cut-off date for party members to be eligible to vote in next month's election, it was challenged in court and lost.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of each case, from the outside it does not look great for those who ask us for our votes on polling day to appear to be narrowing the choice in their own internal elections.
There are plenty of reasons to wonder whether the political parties are increasingly out-of-step with the voters.
The European referendum is only the latest example.
There is much to be said for maintaining your principles even when they are not popular.
So, the Liberal Democrats say they will campaign at the next general election for the UK to be in the EU.
Two peers are reported to have resigned the party whip in protest, perhaps aware that it might not increase the chances of a Lib Dem revival to set its face against the - albeit narrow - decision of a majority of those who voted.
Last year's general election result has not filled any of the parties with confidence, with perhaps the exception of the SNP.
Labour's recovery from one of its worst ever results - in 2010 - consisted of increasing its share of the vote by 1.5%, and losing seats in the process.
The Liberal Democrat share collapsed from 23% to just under 8%.
Its 57 MPs were reduced to eight.
Those two parties, as well as the Conservatives, were all but eliminated from Westminster's Scottish constituencies.
Even UKIP, which took close to four million votes, finishing third overall, ended up with only one MP.
Divided oppositions do not win elections, but they help to hand power to those that do.
David Cameron has bequeathed to his successor, Theresa May, a majority Conservative government, even though the Tories won just shy of 37% of the vote.
"The Tory party is not as strong as the opinion polls might imply," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Foreign Secretary, said.
But he believes the threat to the party's unity posed by Europe has passed.
Although there are divisions even among supporters of Brexit over what deal the UK should negotiate as it leaves the EU, he doubts they will lead to any kind of split, not least because of the cohesive effect on parties of being in power.
"Why is the Tory Party the world's oldest political party?" he asked rhetorically.
"It has been around for 300 years.
"Of course there have been divisions, but the Tory party basically does not have an ideology.
"It has never had an ideology.
"It occasionally has an existential problem, and it does not have one now."
Jenny Willott, one of those Lib Dem MPs ousted in 2015, thinks both her party and UKIP have one advantage compared with the others, a clear and consistent position on the EU.
She thinks the Conservatives and Labour could be hit by divisions over the Brexit negotiations, and at the next general election that could become a cause more important than party.
"We may see people not just standing on the old ticket, so that we have a Labour candidate, a Lib Dem, Tory, UKIP, whatever; I think we might actually see people defining themselves much more clearly as to where they stand on Europe," she said.
The European Union was one of those issues of consensus in the mainstream of British politics; even sceptics such as Sir Malcolm or Jeremy Corbyn still believed the UK should remain in.
Another was light-touch financial regulation, the failure of which exacerbated the effects of the financial crisis.
Faith in the judgement of political elites follows the decline in the "broad church" appeal of political parties.
If there ever was a correlation between income, class and voting, it looks pretty threadbare now.
It is this combination of factors which has made Frank Field, a Labour MP since 1979, sceptical about his party's chances.
Never known for his respect for consensus in politics, Mr Field believes UKIP is "threatening to kill the Labour Party".
Assuming it can overcome its leadership problems, he fears UKIP could do to Labour south of the Scottish border what the SNP has done north of the border.
"If they reshape themselves as the English Party, then there is a real danger that the million voters who previously voted for us in the last election who moved over to UKIP," he said, could be followed by others, "making it impossible for us to be a serious party of opposition challenging for government."
Mr Field said it was not a case of UKIP "stealing" Labour's vote; this passionate EU-sceptic believes there is not what people used to term a "core vote" to steal.
"There clearly is a very, very large section of the Labour vote that does not actually feel natural affinity with Labour any more," he said.
"They are more concerned about the sense of place, of identity, of country."
As Labour MPs agonise about whether or not to split from the parliamentary party in the event of Jeremy Corbyn winning the leadership election, Frank Field fears they may be missing the point.
"We can have this top-down approach that we had with the Gang of Four, the founding of the SDP," he told me.
"We might well do that, but I do not think anybody's listening.
"The key thing that is happening is that voters are moving."
In what direction and who will be there to meet them when they arrive is a question no party politician can answer; no wonder they are so nervous.
As a leading figure in the French Revolution is said to have remarked: "I am their leader and must follow them."

article The countries joined the EU in 2007 but many member states put limits on their citizens working which end this year.
This has raised concerns in the UK that many will now come to seek jobs.
But BBC surveys in each country, both of more than 1,000 people, suggest most would move only with a firm work offer.
Of those questioned more people intended to seek work in the EU including the UK in 2013 than in 2014.
By Sanchia BergBBC Newsnight
There is a significant gap between aspiration and making real concrete plans.
We found that in Romania very small numbers of people, 1% of the total survey sample, said they were looking for work in the UK in 2013 or 2014, whether with a recruitment agency or on their own.
In Bulgaria the figures were higher: 4.2% of those surveyed. However most people interested in coming to the UK, from both countries, said they would only move with a firm offer of work, either from an agency or directly from a company.
For now, more people are planning to move this year, rather than next, but as 2014 approaches, intentions may change.
That is one reason why it is hard to predict precise numbers from the research - the other is that the sample sizes, especially for concrete preparations, are very small.
The survey was complex. It had a long series of questions, ending up with concrete preparations, to try to filter out aspiration, and only capture those who are making real plans.
Read Sanchia's full analysis
A significant number said they would like to work in the UK, but the number making concrete plans was much smaller.
Romania and Bulgaria are among the poorest countries in Europe and when they joined the European Union in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration.
These measures will be dropped on 1 January 2014 giving Bulgarians and Romanians the same rights to work across the union as other EU citizens.
Some in the UK have voiced fears that ending restrictions will trigger a huge influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants seeking work as happened when in 2004 the UK allowed people from European Union accession states including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work freely.
BBC Newsnight wanted to find out what impact these changes were likely to have, particularly on the numbers intending to come to Britain.
In February 2013 the programme commissioned a test poll, asking independent survey company Vitosha to question 1,000 people across Bulgaria.
People were asked if they intended to come to the UK to work. Over a quarter answered yes.
Analysts say the relatively high figure is unsurprising - times are tough in Bulgaria and many Bulgarians dream of a better life. In some surveys as many as 50% of Bulgarians have said they would like to work abroad, but over the past decade only about 6% have actually left.

BBC Newsnight then asked Vitosha in Bulgaria and Gallup Romania to design a questionnaire which would distinguish between aspiration and real concrete plans.
In March 2013 each of the agencies interviewed face to face more than 1,000 people representative of the country as a whole, in villages, in cities, in all regions of Romania and Bulgaria.

People were asked a range of questions about their current situation and whether they had any intentions to move elsewhere in the EU.
When asked whether in the past five years they had considered moving to live and work in another EU member state, 33% of the 1,101 Romanians polled said yes, 67% said no. Of the 1,014 people questioned in Bulgaria - 37% said yes, 63% said no.
When all of those polled were asked to pick their first choice of EU country to move to in either 2013 or 2014, 4.6% of Romanians and 9.3% of Bulgarians chose the UK. These numbers rose to 8.2% for Romanians and 13.6% for Bulgarians when they were asked directly about whether they would consider the UK as a destination.
In the past people from Romania and Bulgaria who have worked in other EU countries have usually opted for places they can reach by car or where the culture and language are closer to their own.
That was still the case among the 197 Romanians who said they were intending to work in another EU country in 2013 - 30% of them said they wanted to go to Italy, 24% to Germany, and 16% to the UK.
However, the Newsnight survey suggested that the UK is becoming a more attractive destination.
When it came to Romanians intending to work in another EU country in 2014, a much smaller group of 73 people, the percentages changed - 25% wanted to go to Italy, 18% to Germany, and 26% to the UK.
Of the 242 Bulgarians who said they intended to work elsewhere in the EU in 2013 - 30% said they wanted to go to Germany, 27% to the UK and 10% to Spain.
As for Bulgarians intending to work elsewhere in the EU in 2014, again a smaller group, 123 people, 31% wanted to go to Germany, 24% to the UK and 12% to Spain.
Some people said one country for 2013 and a different one for 2014 - so they appear twice.
To get a clearer idea of how many people might actually come to the UK, those who had said they were planning to head to the UK were then asked whether they had made any concrete plans to move.
These plans included searching for somewhere to live and to work.
The number of positive responses fell significantly, though more Bulgarians than Romanians were making concrete plans.
Just 1.2% of the Bulgarians and 0.4% of the Romanians said they had begun to look for accommodation.
The numbers were similarly small for those who had started looking for a job - 2.8% of the Bulgarians had started to look for a job with a recruitment agency and 0.3% of the Romanians.
And 1.4% of the Bulgarians and 0.7% of the Romanians had begun to look for work without the aid of a recruitment agency.
With such small numbers analysts say you cannot safely estimate real numbers of how many will come.
"I think if you're looking at who's making concrete plans, say who's spoken for instance to a recruitment consultancy or who has a firm job offer, I think yes the sample sizes there are a bit small to say specifically who are the numbers who are coming," Peter Flade, director of Gallup UK, told BBC Newsnight.
Many of the people who came to the UK from Poland and other eastern European countries did so without a job awaiting them. However, the results of the Newsnight surveys suggest that, for now at least, most Romanians and Bulgarians would only come to the UK with a firm offer of work.
Looking at Romania, of the 90 people who said they were planning to work in the UK, 65% would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
For the 138 Bulgarians answering this question, 60% said they would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
When looking at what kind of people are interested in moving to the UK, the Bulgarian survey suggested they tend to be younger and they are more likely to be unemployed than the average in the survey.
The Romanian survey suggested people interested in moving to the UK are more likely to have a university degree, more likely to be employed, and are likely to be more affluent than those looking to move elsewhere in the EU.
The surveys were conducted before UK Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech in March suggesting restricting entitlements for new immigrants.
However, Newsnight asked whether the UK government considering restricting state benefits to Romanians and Bulgarians would affect their desire to come to the UK.
Although the 90 Romanian respondents who were interested in working in the UK were more professional and better off than the average respondent in the survey, just under half said it would affect their decision to a great or very great extent.
In Bulgaria, most people interested in working in the UK said a benefits change would not affect their decision.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight Bulgaria's Minister of Economy, Energy and Tourism Assen Vassilev said he did not think there would be a mass exodus of Bulgarians when the changes came into effect.
"I think people who wanted to leave have already left. Gone somewhere, come back, gone somewhere else come back. And going back to the survey that shows that 60-70% of people want a firm job offer. They know that going to a place that looks nice in pictures is not going to make your life better."
NB: When looking at the detailed tables that accompany these polls, it is important to look not just at the percentages, but at the total number of respondents who answer each question. At times this number will comprise the entire sample, a large figure that has been designed to reflect the views of the entire population. However, at other times, the number of people responding to individual questions may be as low as 20 and certainly fewer than 100. The margin of error increases significantly as the number of people answering any question diminishes.
summary The EU has urged countries to increase their immigration from the EU-27 to the UK.

article The Magna Carta, Winston Churchill and "one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known" were all celebrated in his Westminster Hall speech.
The President was determinedly upbeat.
On Iraq, he said "our combat mission has ended". On Afghanistan, he declared: "We have broken the Taliban's momentum".
He added: "We will not relent until the people of Libya are protected, and the shadow of tyranny is lifted."
At the heart of his speech was the case for the US, the UK and their allies to play a leading role in global politics.
Unlike President Roosevelt and Churchill they could not set right the world over a brandy, he said, but these countries remained the "greatest catalysts for global action".
Members of Parliament who shared their excitement with the world on Twitter just waiting for the President to arrive made their appreciation obvious as he reminded them he was the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the British Army.
But even before the standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech was complete, they were picking through Barack Obama's state visit comments seeking support for their own political arguments, or evidence of splits with the prime minister.
Earlier, at their joint press conference, David Cameron said: "The president and I agree that we should be turning up the heat in Libya."
It was almost as if he foresaw reporters using folksy pictures of him and President Obama cooking burgers for veterans in the Downing Street garden to illustrate his point.
The President, though, struck a different tone there.
"I think there may be a false perception that there are a whole bunch of secret, super-effective air assets that are in a warehouse somewhere that could just be pulled out and that would immediately solve the situation in Libya," he said.
"That's not the case."
There would be a slow, steady process, he said, and patience was necessary.
Even as the state visit began the US press corps were reminded by the White House that President Obama had told the UK that the US commitment in Libya would be "limited in scope and duration".
The director of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Professor Michael Clarke, said the strikes by US unmanned Predator drones taking place in Libya were the sort of intervention the military coalition opposing Colonel Gaddafi most wanted.
But there were those in the Conservative Party who hoped for more from the President than comments about patience, slow progress and limitations.
One senior Tory backbencher said: "How can he say all that and not help more in Libya?"
The Conservative vice chairman of the party's backbench foreign affairs and defence committee, Mark Pritchard, said: "The United States military is doing much; but the reluctance of President Obama, for primarily domestic political reasons, not to fully commit the United States to the conflict in Libya could unhelpfully prolong the conflict."
Rival British politicians were also listening carefully to the President's words on the economy.
David Cameron sought common ground when he said debt ratios on both sides of the Atlantic would be falling by the second half of this decade - a target set for the UK by the Chancellor.
The President acknowledged the "sequencing or pace" of the two countries' efforts to deal with their deficits could turn out to be different, but said that was down to differences in their economies and the pressures they faced.
He also said both governments wanted to achieve the same ends without mortgaging their futures and leaving a mountain of debt to future generations.
Unsurprisingly both the UK government and opposition drew from those quotes to claim the President's support for their arguments.
Labour said David Cameron would be disappointed the President had refused to support his economic policy.
Government sources suggested he had said everything they would have said about the need for countries to live within their means while protecting spending on infrastructure and technology.
The inevitable arguments about what President Obama really meant, underlined a simple point.
No one could emerge from this state visit doubting America's influence; certainly not David Cameron who hitched a lift in the famous Presidential limousine.
The special relationship, described repeatedly as "essential" during the visit, retains its place at the centre of British foreign policy.
The announcements about collaboration between the US and the UK made public during the press conference served, of course, to underline the point.
As the pageantry and press conferences of the visit played out, the vast US aircraft carrier the USS George H.W. Bush was off the British coast taking part in a major international military training exercise.
Some in David Cameron's party will watch the president leave for the G8 in France wishing the US had promised to commit a little more of that force to the fight to oust Colonel Gaddafi.

article Justice N Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court made the remark while rejecting a plea by a British national accused of sexually abusing a boy
Three children were raped in Delhi earlier this month, sparking outrage.
Two years ago, India tightened its laws on sexual violence after the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
"When [the] law is ineffective and incapable of addressing the menace, this court cannot keep its hands folded and remain a silent spectator, unmoved and oblivious of the recent happenings of horrible blood-curdling gang rapes of children in various parts of India," Mr Kirubakaran said on Friday.
He said the "court is sure the castration of child rapists will fetch magical results" in curbing crimes against children.
"Though the suggestion of castration looks barbaric, barbaric crimes should definitely attract barbaric models of punishment and the very thought of the punishment should deter the culprit from committing the offence," Mr Kirubakaran said.
He made the observation while dismissing a petition by a British national accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy from the southern state of Tamil Nadu in 2011 after promising his mother that he would take care of his education.
The man, who has returned to Britain, had urged the high court to suspend the proceedings against him in a lower court in Tamil Nadu.

article Friday's South Coast Proms concert was cancelled due to bad weather, with ticket holders offered a refund plus free entry to Saturday's pop concert.
It drew criticism from those who had already paid to attend Saturday's show.
Organisers said the free tickets were a "gesture of goodwill" but made no comment about the complaints.
The two concerts are to mark the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie begins Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup.
Organisers issued a statement on Friday explaining the South Coast Proms concert, featuring the Band of HM Royal Marines, was cancelled for "public safety reasons".
It added it would refund all Friday evening tickets, which cost £25, as well as offer them free tickets for the Portsmouth Live! concert featuring Spandau Ballet, Wet Wet Wet and McBusted.
Those with Saturday tickets - which cost up to £48.50 - took to the event's own Facebook page to complain.
On Friday Martine Halliday posted: "I have paid £131 for three tickets and people who bought tickets for tonight get a full refund and free entry into tomorrow's event. Come on, seriously, sort this out!!!"
Jan Spencer, who said she paid £200 for Saturday tickets, posted: "To give people free tickets to a completely different concert as well as a refund is disgraceful. I'm so very annoyed".
Andy Cottrell posted that the handling of the issue was a "shambles".
Others complained about the prospect of more people attending the Saturday concert, potentially making it crowded and cramped.
A concerts spokeswoman said: "We offered the Saturday night tickets as a gesture of goodwill to many of those who had travelled to Portsmouth and, due to inclement weather conditions, had missed out on their concert opportunity."

Maersk Oil said it was part of a drive to reduce operating costs by 20% by the end of 2016.
The UK jobs are linked to the retirement of the Janice installation, 150 miles south-east of Aberdeen, and changes to the offshore rotation.
Maersk is also scaling back its business in Qatar and Norway, as well as at its Copenhagen headquarters, and in Kazakhstan.

article Each unprotected department has been asked to come up with savings plans of 25% and 40% of their budget.
The chancellor said departments had also been asked to help meet a target of 150,000 new homes on public sector land by 2020.
The NHS and per-pupil schools budgets will be protected in the review, which will be published on 25 November.
Mr Osborne, who gave evidence to MPs on Tuesday about the Budget and his spending priorities, said that "with careful management of public money, we can get more for less".
The Treasury said "large savings" would be required of unprotected departments, which have been asked to model two scenarios: of 25% and 40% cuts to their budgets by 2020.
The BBC's economics editor Robert Peston said what was being proposed would require a reinvention of some services taken for granted by the public.
Mr Osborne has already unveiled £12bn of welfare savings plus £5bn of tax avoidance prevention measures - which together with the £20bn of departmental spending cuts make up the £37bn figure earmarked to get government finances back in the black.
Analysis by economics editor Robert Peston
Today I want you to imagine what you would cut from your lifestyle if told that your income would fall by either 25% or 40%, after adjusting for inflation, over the next four years.
It is quite a scary thought, isn't it? Presumably, if you haven't done it already, you'll think about switching the weekly shop to one of those discounters. You will heat up the water for fewer hours. And the kids' swimming lessons will have to go.
But those savings would not even scratch the surface of a 40% cut. To reach that, the kids may have to share a bedroom, so you can take in a paying lodger. And the car would be history.
All of which serves to explain why ministers and officials in all but protected departments and services - that is everything but health, schools, defence and overseas aid - are having panic attacks today.
Because they have been instructed by the chancellor to "model" the impact on the services they provide of finding savings of either 25% or 40% by 2019-20 - or £20bn per annum of cuts in aggregate.  This is the stuff of public-service reinvention, not efficiency.

Spending limits will be set for government departments, which will also be asked to examine the way they manage their assets and consider privatisation and contracting out where necessary.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said talk of cuts of as much as 40% were just "a ranging shot".
"Past experience would suggest that initial pitching by the Treasury should be regarded as aspirational," he told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
"But it is clear that to deliver the overall fiscal trajectory departments collectively will have to make substantial savings, double-digit percentage savings."
The review document says it will prioritise spending which: promotes innovation and greater collaboration in public services; promotes growth and productivity including through devolution within England; promotes choice and competition and which drive efficiency and value for money.
Although full details will not be published until November, the document does include some details of specific areas for change.
On local government it says "the government will look at transforming the approach" to its financing and "further decentralising power, in order to maximise efficiency, local economic growth and the integration of public services".
It also sets out plans to sell off publicly owned land that is surplus to requirements, including assets owned by the Ministry of Defence.
The Treasury said the MoD, alone, accounted for 1% of all land in the UK, while the state land holdings were worth £300bn.
Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock told the BBC that £1.5bn of land had been disposed of during the last Parliament and that ministers had only "just started getting going".
"It is clear we can release much, much more," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. "It also contributes to our wider objectives like housebuilding. The two go hand in hand."
But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the scale of the cuts envisaged meant it would take a lot more than "flogging off a few disused airbases" to meet the chancellor's targets.
For Labour, shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told BBC News: "During the Budget speech the chancellor said that he was going to step off the rollercoaster ride in public spending and now he's asking his cabinet colleagues to perhaps think about deeper cuts than he envisaged only a fortnight ago.
"So it's very unclear what the chancellor's coherent approach is here and I think we do need, of course, those sensible savings but he needs to now come clean and say what exactly is he planning."
The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie said some of the targets set for departments were likely to prove "completely unmanageable" and Mr Osborne risked "setting himself up for a very large fall".
"Perhaps he's setting the bar high and he'll appear to be the good guy if it's less when push comes to shove," he said. "I think the key thing is we look at the last parliament. He failed on all these major targets.
"He seems to be wanting to push the boundaries time after time after time. There's no longer fat to be cut. It's into the bone and the impact on services could be catastrophic."

article It failed to pass on the last day of the previous assembly after opposition from Plaid Cymru.
Carwyn Jones told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement the bill would be tabled again without the e-cigs ban.
He said Labour's minority government would also have to rethink its council shake-up plans to win wider support.
"There is no point trying to bang our heads against a brick wall when it comes to e-cigs," he said.
"The public health bill will be brought back to the assembly but, clearly, there is no point including the provisions on e-cigs when we know they are not going to get through."
His comments come at the start of a new assembly term with the minority government requiring support from other parties to pass through plans.
Tobacco control action group ASH Wales has welcomed the minister's decision. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: "The evidence shows that e-cigs are being used as a cessation tool by a significant number of ex-smokers."
The Public Health (Wales) Bill failed to pass at the last assembly after the presiding officer was required, because of a tie, to also vote, bringing the vote to 27 AMs against and 26 for.
As well as the e-cigarette measure, it aimed to create a compulsory licensing system for tattooists, prohibit intimate piercing of children under 16 and require councils to produce a local toilets strategy.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was "delighted that Labour has been forced to admit that they won't be pursuing this misguided policy".
The failed vote came despite AMs previously backing revised e-cigarette plans.
On local government reorganisation plans, the first minister admitted he would now need to find "common ground" with the other political parties in the Senedd.
Labour has long hoped to cut the number of authorities from 22 to single figures which has been opposed by the Conservatives among others.
He said: "Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious.
"But we do need to find a way forward."
Meanwhile, he was adamant that a preferred option for a new M4 relief road south of Newport, known as the black route, was the only way forward.
However, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has previously ruled out any kind of deal with Labour if it pushed the proposals forward.
Speaking on BBC Wales' Sunday Politics, Ms Wood said: "Danger faces the government if it continues to be intransigent".
She said it will need the backing of another party to get policies passed, adding that Plaid Cymru's 12 AMs would "consider very carefully what we do with our votes".
Carwyn Jones said he was just reflecting the arithmetic of the assembly in accepting that there wouldn't be enough support to push ahead with a ban on e-cigs in Wales and cutting the number of councils.
Having Kirsty Williams in the cabinet helps him with the numbers but the first minister has to choose his battles because he needs support from the opposition in order to get his policies, and budgets, through a vote in the Senedd.
Mr Jones says he won't budge on the M4 relief road, which means there's a real stalemate between him and Plaid Cymru. He wants their support on the budget, so it seems something will have to give.
Another tricky situation for Mr Jones is the agreement with Plaid Cymru which paved the way for him to be re-appointed as first minister.
Today we've seen how little detail there was in the agreement. Plaid want more doctors and a big commission to look at infrastructure. Carwyn Jones seemed cool on the idea of the latter, and unclear what Plaid wanted on the former.
With so little detail in the deal, I asked Leanne Wood if she had been conned by the first minister to get into power.  Her answer: "I don't think so." If she starts to think otherwise, Carwyn Jones could find life difficult in the Senedd if the only other left-leaning party refuses to work with him.

article Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan secured 68% of shares in July this year, with the trust retaining 21.1%.
The supporters claim they were not consulted and were not able to buy more shares themselves.
A statement on the Trust's website said it had received legal advice, but no decision had been taken.
"We are conscious any legal action would create uncertainty," the statement said.
"Our first preference has always revolved around protecting our shareholding and influence at the football club.
"[Legal action] remains a last resort, however we have a duty to our members for the best long-term interests of our fans."
The Trust members felt they were not informed of the sale of shares at an early enough stage, and their efforts to increase their own holding to 25% were rebuffed.
Their criticism is not just of Kaplan and Levien but of the previous board members who sold their shares to the Americans.
The Trust was also critical of the majority shareholders over the sacking of manager Francesco Guidolin, and the appointment of successor Bob Bradley.
The Supporters' Trust forum held at the Liberty Stadium was told a barrister had given initial advice, which was still being assessed.
"Our legal options are still being assessed and we will obtain the best guidance we can to ensure the Trust members' best interests are maintained.
"Whilst we have sought an initial opinion from counsel, we have not yet made any firm decisions in terms of the next steps to be taken."
Any legal action against the new owners or the previous shareholders would need the full approval of the Trust Members via a forum or ballot.
Swansea City have so far declined to comment.

article They are still without a Championship win this summer and lost to Notts by an innings and 280 runs on Wednesday, the county's worst defeat in 85 years.
Khan told BBC Radio Leicester their problems were not a reflection of dressing room tensions.
"There are no issues with Pierre de Bruyn. It's 100% nonsense," he said
"These things take time, to understand how people want to work, and Pierre understands the players.
"This is purely around performance. When you step to that white line, I can't help and Pierre can't help the players. These guys are pro cricketers and they've got to go out and do it for themselves."
All-rounder Neil Dexter did not feature against Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire but Khan said his absence was because of "personal issues".
He continued: "People will like to spin conspiracy theories and rumours like he's fallen out with the coach over this and that but it's not the case.
"Pierre and I speak to Neil on a daily basis and we're supporting him through a difficult personal situation that he's got from a family point of view.
"As soon as he is back and he is firing, he will be back playing."
De Bruyn, 40, was promoted to head coach in 2016 after predecessor Andrew McDonald left to coach Australian side Melbourne Renegades.
Despite Leicestershire's winless run this campaign, Khan insists de Bruyn can turn the club's fortunes around.
"I believe in Pierre in terms of his coaching ability, his philosophies and he's passionate about the Foxes," he added.
"He's doing everything he can and he has my full support. Nothing will change overnight so now's not the time to panic."

article The suit alleges that some employees were fired from one franchise because there were "too many black people".
It is being backed by a group campaigning for better wages for fast-food workers and the local Virginia National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
McDonald's has not yet commented specifically on the suit.
McDonalds issued a general statement, saying: "McDonald's has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity of employees, independent franchisees, customers and suppliers, and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values.
"McDonald's and our independent owner-operators share a commitment to the well-being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald's restaurants."
The suit is part of a continuing effort on the part of labour organisers to hold McDonald's responsible for the behaviour of its franchisees.
McDonald's and other restaurant groups have argued that it should not be held responsible for the behaviour and labour practices of franchisees.
However, their position has been weakened by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
It ruled that McDonalds "could be held jointly liable for labour and wage violations by its franchise operators" in July.
Since then, current and former employees have filed lawsuits against many McDonald's franchises and the larger corporation alleging wage theft and other illegal practices.
In the lawsuit filed in Virginia on Thursday, which is not part of the NLRB's larger activity, 10 former employees - nine of whom are African-American and one of whom is Hispanic - allege that they were subject to "rampant racial and sexual harassment" by supervisors at three restaurants run by McDonald's franchisee Michael Simon.
Mr Simon became franchise operator of the three restaurants in late 2013, when the majority of the employees at the restaurants were African-American.
Soon after, the suit alleges Mr Simon instituted a plan to hire more white employees, with supervisors allegedly telling employees that the restaurants were "too dark" and they needed to hire new employees to "get the ghetto out of the store".
Subsequently, in mid-2014, a large number of white employees were hired and several of the African-American employees who are part of the suit were fired.
The fired workers alleged that when they attempted to contact McDonald's corporate office, there was no response.
McDonald's is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings before US markets open on Friday.
summary A lawsuit against fast food chain McDonald's has been filed in the High Court in London.

article Retired teacher Roger Whitworth compiled a huge dossier of pictures of the Worcester City Ancient Arms and the Worcester City Modern Arms.
The heraldic emblems can be seen on buildings, bins, benches, gates and even a radiator cover.
The city council received the Corporate Heraldry Award at a ceremony in London.
The accolade, sponsored by the national Heraldry Society is given twice a year to recognise how coats of arms strengthen a place or organisation's identity.
Worcester City's ancient arms feature a castle while the modern arms have the addition of three black pears.
Mr Whitworth, a former lecturer who runs a genealogy business, entered the city for the award.
He wrote in detail about how the people of Worcester identify the council and the city using the crests.
Floreat Semper Fidelis Civitas - Let the faithful city ever flourish
Civitas in bello et pace fidelis  - In war and peace, a faithful city
Semper fidelis mutare sperno  - Ever faithful, I scorn to change
"We are delighted that Worcester's commitment to its heraldic heritage and the importance of the city crest has been recognised nationally," said Councillor Lucy Hodgson, the council's cabinet member for history and heritage.
"This award can only help to strengthen Worcester's case to gain Heritage City status in 2016."

article Rugby union to the uninitiated, football-fanatic teenager is a mystifying thing. But could a home World Cup in England change that?
Some of the children at Loreto High School in Manchester could hardly afford boots when their PE teacher James Hyland introduced rugby three years ago.
But the Rugby Football Union's (RFU) All Schools programme has enabled 400 state secondary schools, including Loreto, to afford to get rugby off the ground - as well as some footwear.
"The kids had never touched a rugby ball in their lives," says Hyland, whose school has gone from having no rugby union, to fielding a boys' team at every age level and fostering a link with local amateur club Broughton Park.
"We had our first training session and they were throwing the ball forwards, trying to trip people up as they went past and wearing their old trainers.
"It was starting with the basics. Some of them had never even seen a game on TV."
The lack of rugby at Loreto High School puzzled student Calum Conner Jones, a winger for Broughton Park, when he joined. So he did something about it.
"I asked if we could start a rugby team. I had a chat with Mr Hyland and they were all for it," says the 15-year-old.
"A lot of the boys weren't really bothered about rugby. They wouldn't have even known there was a club down the road.
"Now a lot of them go and play. One guy had never played before and after a year had a trial with Lancashire."
Union, for so long derided for its reputation as a game for the privileged, has struggled to gain traction in football-dominated state schools, particularly in the north.
"One of our greatest objectives was to change the perception that rugby is an exclusive sport - and it is a perception," says Steve Grainger, the RFU's development director.
"We wanted to really hit schools that perhaps rugby could have the greatest impact on - ones with low numbers of A-C grades at GCSE and free school meals - they're a good indicator of a school's social-economic background."
Loreto, according to Hyland, has a diverse student population, with about "30-40%" from middle-class backgrounds and the remainder from "very deprived" backgrounds.
It sits on the fringes of leafy Didsbury and the poorer inner-city areas of Moss Side and Whalley Range.
Broughton's link with the school has seen the club stretch its demographic beyond its traditional, private school recruitment.
Last year, Broughton had six players in its under-six programme - this season they have 21. And most of their U15s and U16s players have come through the All Schools programme.
"We are such a mix of social diversity. We have children that go to public school but we also have children that go to state schools," says youth secretary Pippa Ranson.
"They're out there and they just play. Some children have gone to grammars, some to comprehensives, they're still playing rugby together."
Teacher Hyland came to realise the gap between the most privileged and impoverished of his students when he took a group on a funded trip to Twickenham.
"One boy lives with his granddad and has never been out of Manchester," says Hyland, who himself plays for North Manchester.
"I don't think he'd stayed in a hotel before and was like 'I've got my own bathroom?'.
"At breakfast he piled his plate with everything. He didn't understand the concept of a buffet breakfast - he had never seen one. That for me was the main eye opener of how deprived some of the children are.
"He's really come out of his shell now since playing rugby."
There are, of course, gaps in the system. Loreto has undoubtedly excelled at starting rugby in the school because it has a PE teacher who is passionate about the sport.
Other schools would not have found it as easy - although just two schools of the 400 that have taken funding have dropped out of the system.
There have also been missed opportunities. The Uruguay squad used Broughton as a training base before their group game against England in Manchester, but none of the club's youngsters were given an opportunity to interact with the World Cup players.
That was, admittedly, down to tournament organisers and not the RFU - and local children did interact with England players in Eccles just days after the hosts' disappointing exit from the competition.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Then there is the question of where girls fit into the equation.
The RFU says one in three children affected by the All Schools programme are girls - a figure Grainger describes as "light years ahead of where we were a decade ago".
Regardless of how corporate strategies and development targets are played out, the 2015 World Cup's biggest influence on youngsters could well be its spectacle - the action seen in stadiums and on TV from arguably the greatest union World Cup of all time.
Clubs were warned to expect an upturn in interest of 33% during the World Cup, although we might never know whether curiosity towards the sport was dampened by England's early exit.
Regardless, it is how that interest endures, years down the line, that will be the true test of the World Cup's legacy.
"The reports from rugby clubs I've been to have said they've had more youngsters come down," said Grainger.
"I've seen more kids throwing rugby balls around than I've ever seen before.
"If by 2019 we don't have more membership at clubs and more children playing in schools, we'll be saying it won't have worked. But I'll expect more people to be playing rugby."
summary A World Cup in England could be a turning point for the sport.

article Kirkersville police Chief Steven Eric Disario, 36 - only recently appointed - was among the dead, his deputies told US media.
Two employees were found dead inside the Pine Kirk Care Center, and Disario was found outside the building.
The authorities have not given a motive for the shooting, and have not identified the other victims.
It is unclear if the gunman killed himself or whether he had a relationship with any of the victims.
Disario had only taken over the job about three weeks ago, Licking County Sheriff Randy Thorp told reporters on Friday afternoon.
He had six children, and one more "on the way", Mr Thorp said, adding that "it's a real hard day for all of us".
"It's just a tragic event," Mr Thorp said, adding that Disario had been responding to reports of a man with a gun when he was shot around 08:00 local time.
"I believe the last radio transmission we had from (Disario) was that he had the subject in sight," he said.
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the accused shooter took two hostages in an alley, but both were released unharmed.
The 23 residents of the nursing home, who barricaded themselves inside during the shooting, have been moved so that investigators can analyse the crime scene.
Kirkersville is a small village about 25 miles (40km) outside Columbus, the capital of Ohio.
A primary school near the shooting scene was placed on lockdown, and classes were later cancelled for the day.
Governor John Kasich has taken to Twitter to pay his condolences, also ordering that flags at the state capitol fly at half-mast.
"Ohio mourns the loss of Kirkersville Chief Eric Disario, who died in the line of duty," he wrote, adding "blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God".

"The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10, but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.
"The recapture of this prisoner is now a matter for the police."
Byrne was sentenced in 2008 to a total of nine years' imprisonment for burglary, robbery and theft.
Officers in Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, have appealed for anyone with information about Byrne's whereabouts to get in touch.
Byrne is described as white and of medium build, with blue eyes and a goatee beard.

article About 90 machine gun rounds were fired at the object, which has not been identified. North Korea has flown drones over the border in the past.
In a statement, the South Korean military said it was "maintaining high vigilance".
The incident comes amid continuing high tension on the Korean peninsula.
On Sunday Pyongyang conducted what it said was a successful test of a medium-range ballistic missile.
That test came a week after North Korea tested what it said was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead.
The pace of North Korean missile tests has increased in recent months and experts fear it indicates progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could strike the continental US.
The UN Security Council is to hold a closed-door meeting on North Korea on Tuesday evening. In a statement on Monday, it agreed to "take further significant measures including sanctions" to force North Korea to end its "highly destabilising behaviour".
The spike in tensions comes with a new president in South Korea. Moon Jae-in was sworn into office earlier this month after the previous leader, Park Geun-hye, was impeached. She is now on trial for corruption.
Mr Moon has adopted a more conciliatory stance than his predecessor, calling for more dialogue with the North.
South Korean military officials did not say whether they hit or secured the object that flew across the demilitarised zone, but similar incidents have occurred in the past.
In January 2016, South Korean border troops fired shots at a suspected drone.
In 2014, South Korean officials said they found two North Korean drones, one south of the demilitarised zone near Paju and the other on an island near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border.

article In Vanity Fair magazine, Monica Lewinsky, 40, writes that she deeply regrets the fling.
The president "took advantage" of her, she writes, though she describes their relationship as consensual.
In 1998, Republicans failed in their effort to oust him from office on the grounds he had lied about the affair.
But with Mr Clinton's wife Hillary said to be mulling a 2016 run for the presidency, the Lewinsky matter has re-emerged in US political discourse, in part because Republicans are eager to wield it against her.
In an advance excerpt from the article released by Vanity Fair, Ms Lewinsky writes she hopes to reclaim her story and says she is still recognised every day and sees her name thrown about in pop culture and the news media.
"I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton," she writes.
"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened."
Ms Lewinsky writes that she suffered abuse and humiliation after the scandal broke in 1998, in part because she was made a "scapegoat" to protect the president.
"The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me," she wrote.
"And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power."
Since leaving the Clinton administration, she worked briefly as a handbag designer and as the host of a US reality dating show.
Ms Lewinsky then moved to London for a graduate degree, but said she has had difficulty gaining employment in the US because of her past.
Arguing Mr Clinton had lied to federal investigators about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky, who was in her early 20s, the Republicans in the House of Representatives impeached the president, essentially bringing him up on charges in the Senate to determine whether he could be expelled from office.
That effort failed, and Mr Clinton served in the White House until his term ended in 2000.
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, went on to be elected US senator and to serve as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and is currently tipped as a frontrunner for the Democratic 2016 presidential nomination.
The Republicans have indicated recently that Mr Clinton's affair with Ms Lewinsky will be fair game should Mrs Clinton indeed run.
Republican Senator Rand Paul - also tipped to run for the presidency in 2016 - said this year that "bosses shouldn't prey on young interns in their office".
Mr Clinton "took advantage of a girl that was 20-years-old and an intern in his office", he added. "There is no excuse for that and that is predatory behaviour."
In her piece, Ms Lewinsky signals that her desire in breaking her silence after so many years is to "give a purpose" to her past.
"Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation," she writes.
Ms Lewinsky now aims "to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums".

article Unemployed father-of-17 Philpott was jailed for life on Thursday for killing six of his children in a house fire.
Mr Osborne said there was a "question for government and society" about the influence of benefits on behaviour.
But Labour condemned the comments as "a cynical act of a desperate chancellor".
Philpott was convicted of manslaughter, along with his wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley, over an arson revenge plot that went wrong.
Much of the coverage of the trial focused on Philpott's lifestyle and the fact that his wife and his mistress Lisa Willis had lived with him at the three-bedroom council house in Derby with 11 of their children until Miss Willis moved out in February 2012.
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
When politicians talk about a subject as shocking as the Philpott case they know they will grab voters' attention.
George Osborne has sent out the message that he thinks there is a link between Mick Philpott's lifestyle and the welfare debate.
Ed Balls has accused Osborne of playing politics with a human tragedy.
There are risks for both sides.
Voters may think the Conservatives are making political hay from a unique and horrific crime.
They may think Labour sounds insufficiently tough on welfare.
Or they may just think this is another round in a long fight between two big political beasts.
Philpott received more than ??8,000 a year in child benefit for his 11 children, as well as the income support and wages paid to his wife and mistress, which went into his bank account.
He had already achieved tabloid notoriety as "Shameless Mick" and "Britain's biggest scrounger" before his trial began.
In 2006 he appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show, on ITV, to demand a bigger council house.
Mr Osborne, who has been defending government cuts to housing benefit and other welfare changes, which came into force this week, said: "Philpott is responsible for these absolutely horrendous crimes and these are crimes that have shocked the nation; the courts are responsible for sentencing him.
"But I think there is a question for government and for society about the welfare state - and the taxpayers who pay for the welfare state - subsidising lifestyles like that, and I think that debate needs to be had."
But, in a blog post, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls was highly critical of his opposite number, saying: "George Osborne's calculated decision to use the shocking and vile crimes of Mick Philpott to advance a political argument is the cynical act of a desperate chancellor."
Mr Balls demanded "a proper debate about welfare reform".
"But for the chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office," he added.
Former Liberal Democrat education minister Sarah Teather joined in the criticism, saying she was "shocked and appalled that George Osborne has stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic deaths of six young children".
"It is deeply irresponsible for such a senior politician to seek to capitalise on public anger about this case, and in doing so demonise anybody who receives any kind of welfare support," the MP for Brent Central said.
"Mr Philpott should be held fully accountable for his awful actions and it is reprehensible to seek to explain it away by blaming the welfare system which Osborne has been so happy to wage war on."
But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps backed the chancellor.
He said: "I think we should be proud of having a welfare system that looks after the most vulnerable in our society.  It's a proper safety net.  Of course there a proper debate to be had about where this should begin and end, and of course that case highlighted some of the extremes."
Philpott has been told he will serve a minimum of 15 years in prison, while Mairead and Mosley were told they would serve at least half of their 17-year sentences.
During the trial, the prosecuting lawyer told the jury: "Michael Philpott did not want to work. He just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings."
Mr Osborne has dismissed claims that his benefit reforms mark the end of the welfare state as "shrill, headline-seeking nonsense", arguing instead that they encourage people to work rather than rely on payments.

article United Utilities needs to stop taking supplies from Ennerdale Water in the Lake District, which is a protected wildlife  habitat.
Instead it wants a new 62-mile (100km) pipeline from Thirlmere reservoir to provide water to about 150,000 people.
Allerdale Council is the final local authority in the county to approve the company's planning application.
United Utilities estimates the project, which also includes new treatment works and pumping stations, will create about 400 jobs.
Areas around Whitehaven, Egremont, Workington, Maryport, Cockermouth and Wigton will receive their water via the new pipeline when it is completed in 2022.
The route will roughly follow the A591 from Thirlmere to a planned new treatment works near Cockermouth.
The plan was approved by Allerdale Council despite objections from several groups including Friends of the Lake District and the Ramblers, who claimed it would significantly damage the landscape.
United Utilities said water extraction from Ennerdale had to stop to meet EU environmental regulations and to prevent predicted shortages to supplies.
A spokesman added: "This is the culmination of several years of detailed planning and consultation.
"We've worked to develop a scheme which delivers major long-term benefits for west Cumbria, while seeking to minimise traffic inconvenience and safeguarding the environment during construction.
"The new scheme will ease the pressure on sensitive local water sources and provide a more secure supply for homes and businesses for the decades to come."
Work on the new pipeline is due to begin in March 2017.

article Back then, some 2,500 people died and more than 7,000 were injured. Thankfully, we are not expecting loss of life on that scale here.
In part this is because of the strides made in recent years in improving readiness and reaction.
But the fact that the population of central Italy is currently living on such an acute alert status also will have further limited any dreadful consequences.
We have now seen three Magnitude-6 tremors in Italy's Apennines region in just three months.
Quakes 'ever present for Apennines'
BBC Science: Earthquakes
The first, in August, was a 6.2. This was followed mid-week by a 6.1. Initial calculations put Sunday's event at 6.6, which in terms of the energy released is actually four times bigger than the quake in August.
Every time there is a rumble, the population's response will be rapid, and saved seconds save lives.
For example, Wednesday's tremor was immediately preceded by a 5.5 foreshock, which would have had many people scurrying for the open streets, putting them safely out of harm's way when the big tremor hit two hours later.
Many Apennines residents will of course be asking why there have been so many large quakes in so short a time frame. But this is often how the geology works.
"This is an earthquake sequence; these are related events," explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK.
"And this triggering of multiple events, sometimes a few days or weeks apart, is well known behaviour."
Look back to 1997 or as far back as 1703, and this clustering in time and space is seen in the same region of Italy.
Scientists are having to move fast, though, to keep on top of what exactly is occurring and to try to join the dots.
The big picture is reasonably well understood. Wider tectonic forces in the Earth's crust have led to the Apennines being pulled apart at a rate of roughly 3mm per year - about a 10th of the speed at which your fingernails grow.
But this stress is then spread across a multitude of different faults that cut through the mountains. And this network is fiendishly complicated.
It does now look as though August's event broke two neighbouring faults, starting on one known as the Laga and then jumping across to one called the Vettore.
The mid-week tremors appear to have further broken the northern end of the Vettore. But both in August and mid-week, it seems only the top portions of the faults have gone, and the big question is whether the deeper segments have now failed in the latest event.
Experts on the ground will be looking for scarps where the soil has split. Dr Laura Gregory from Leeds University, UK, is currently on the scene.
"We're doing monitoring using GPS receivers to look at how the ground is moving in the aftermath of these events.
"We're also looking at the surface expression of the earthquake as well because this can tell you a lot about earthquakes in general and about the earthquakes in this region," she told BBC News.
"It's very important research to do. We still don't really know enough about these earthquakes and we want to get better at forecasting them."
If Sunday's event has broken the lower portions of the faults then surface evidence may be sparse.
Further information will come from the radar satellites that will overfly the Apennines region in the coming days to map the quake zone.
Their pictures will be compared with space images acquired before Sunday's big tremor to see how the rocks have moved.
Europe's Sentinel-1 mission was launched specifically with this kind of work in mind.
Sentinel-1 actually comprises two spacecraft that have already revealed considerable insight into the August quake and its connection with Wednesday's double tremor.
One of the satellites is due to sweep over the Apennines again on Monday.
"We'll then know if it is the deeper extent of both faults that has gone this time," said Dr Walters.
"This would be what we call 'depth segmentation' where the shallow portions break followed by the deeper portions. And it means you can have an earthquake repeating more frequently on the same faults."

article A newly established group has been chosen by Brighton and Hove City Council to run the parade and ticketed festival in Preston Park.
Pride Brighton and Hove will donate Â£1 of every ticket sold to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender charities.
In areport the council said the event had not been "financially successful"for the previous organisers, Pride South East.
The event, which is usually held in August, will now take place on 1 September due to pressures from the London 2012 Olympics.
One of the organisers, Michael Deol, said the festival was integral to Brighton's economy.
"The annual event has ensured a fantastic summer boom for businesses across the city from guest houses and hotels to restaurants, shops and clubs," he said.
A council spokeswoman said it received two proposals for running Pride.
"Pride Brighton and Hove are a new community interest company that has committed to ring fence a proportion of ticket income from the planned park event to go directly to charity to benefit the local LGBT community," she said.
"Pride is an important event for the city - not only for residents and visitors but also our economy."

article The 24-year-old England international is now committed to the Premier League club until 2021 and there is the option to extend the deal by a further year.
Lingard has made 70 appearances for United, who he joined as a seven-year-old, and won four caps for his country.
"Manchester United has always been a big part of my life," said Lingard.
"I feel great pride every time I pull the shirt on."
Lingard holds the rare distinction of scoring in three successive games for his club at Wembley.
After netting the winner in last season's FA Cup final, Lingard also scored against Leicester in the Community Shield and Southampton as United won the EFL Cup in February.
"To have scored in two cup finals for my boyhood club were immensely proud moments for me and my family," he added.
"As a team, we have already won a major trophy this season and I look forward to helping us win many more under this great manager."
United boss Jose Mourinho said: "Jesse is a popular member of the squad and I am delighted he has signed a new contract.
"He has good intelligence which, when combined with his energy and ability, makes for a player with a great future ahead of him."
Lingard had spells on loan at Leicester, Birmingham and Brighton before he was given his first-team debut by Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal against Swansea in the opening game of the 2014-15 season.
This season he has played 29 times, scoring five goals.
summary Liverpool have signed Jesse Lingard on a two-year deal from Manchester City.

article Lisa Cobbold, 24, was pictured with non-league side Needham Market after a bridge collapse closed the M20 in Kent.
The team did not get her name but wanted to know if she made it to her wedding.
When friends saw her picture, she contacted the BBC from Las Vegas.
The Suffolk-based team, who were heading to an away game at Folkestone when they got stuck in the traffic jam on 27 August, were delighted to hear she became Mrs Kendall later that day - albeit two hours later than planned.
More news from Suffolk
Mrs Kendall, from Welling, London, was heading to Detling when her two wedding vehicles, decked in ribbons, ground to a halt.
"I wasn't too worried as we were 15 minutes away, but then people showed us news reports about the bridge," she said.
The pedestrian bridge over the M20 collapsed after being hit by a lorry carrying a digger.
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when he threw himself from his bike to avoid hitting the bridge.
Mrs Kendall spotted the football team watching an impromptu cricket game on the closed carriageway.
"I didn't know who they were, but they were lovely lads and even said we could use the toilet on their coach," she said.
She had her photograph taken with them and the team later posted it on their website, saying they wanted to make sure she got to the church on time and congratulate her.
"Jake and I were on our honeymoon in Las Vegas when I got all these messages from people saying I was on the news.
"I said to Jake, 'it's OK, I'm only on the BBC'."
Mrs Kendall had made it to her wedding two hours late after part of the road was reopened.
"Everyone parted and let us go first. The football players all cheered as we drove through," she said.
Mrs Kendall, who changed into her wedding gown at the venue, said her husband-to be joked: "You like to keep me waiting, don't you. I thought you'd stood me up."
Mark Easlea, Needham Market FC's secretary, said the team "wishes them all the best for the future".

article A total of 67 families will be represented by the same legal team as they seek compensation over the scandal at Aberdeen's Hazlehead Crematorium.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
Aberdeen City Council announced in December last year that it had approved a new financial compensation scheme for those affected.
The deadline for claims has been set for 1 February.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
It followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
A report into the scandal by Dame Elish Angiolini described the practices as "abhorrent".
Thompsons Solicitors said they originally represented 21 families but that had risen to 67 as the compensation deadline looms.
Company partner Patrick McGuire said the compensation announcement was justification for the families "who had fought for years to get the council to acknowledge the wrongs done to them".
He added: "I have rarely seen such a large amount of people contacting us in such a short space of time.
"I think what this actually shows is the number of families in the Aberdeen area that have been touched by this scandal and have suffered in silence. They no longer need to do so."

article Christopher Meli, 20, was discovered on Saturday near houses at Glasvey Close.
Police said the youths, two aged 18 and one aged 16, had been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.
They are also investigating a serious assault on another young man who was in the company of Mr Meli.
He was taken to hospital, but later discharged.
Mr Meli's mother Vanessa Burke said her son was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"I believe that Christopher died a very violent death," she said.
"I know in my heart and soul he was calling me, I believe he was calling me, or both of us. Me and Christopher were close, anyone who knows us, knows how close we were."
Speaking on Sunday, Det Ch Insp Gareth Talbot said: "After examination by ambulance staff the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A number of injuries were noted on the body and as such, we are treating this death as murder."
Police appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
John McPoland from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said a crew attended the scene.
"At 12:50 GMT on Saturday the ambulance service received a call from a resident in the Glasvey Close area reporting that there was a young man lying on the street with blood coming from his head," he said.
"He did indicate to us at the time that he felt the young man was dead.
"We did send a crew up to the scene and unfortunately they found that the person was deceased at the scene and they stayed until the police arrived and assisted the police as best they could."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said she was "shocked" to hear about the death.
"I have spoken to the local PSNI and they tell me they are treating it as a violent death," she said.
"My thoughts and prayers are with this young man's family at this time and I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward to the PSNI."

article The 40-year-old from South Lanarkshire had been in a "stable" condition at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
She was put on an RAF Hercules aircraft which took her to London where she was taken to  the Royal Free Hospital.
Ms Cafferkey was treated there twice in 2015 after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone the previous year.
A spokesman for the Royal Free said she had been transferred to the hospital "due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus".
The spokesman added: "She will now be treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team under nationally agreed guidelines.
"The Ebola virus can only be transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person while they are symptomatic so the risk to the general public remains low and the NHS has well established and practised infection control procedures in place."
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said Ms Cafferkey had been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow "under routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Unit".
The health board said she was "undergoing further investigations and her condition remains stable".
Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "I'd like to thank the expert NHS staff in Glasgow who have looked after her and helped with her transfer to the Royal Free Hospital, where Pauline has been treated before and where clinicians agreed it would be best to continue her treatment."
The nurse, from Halfway, Cambuslang, contracted the virus while working as part of a British team at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre.
She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free at the beginning of 2015 after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.
Ms Cafferkey was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, and in March 2015 returned to work as a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.
In October last year it was discovered that Ebola was still present in her body, with health officials later confirming she had been diagnosed with meningitis caused by the virus.
Ebola is a viral illness of which the initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And that is just the beginning: subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding.
The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.
It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.
Ebola outbreaks occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, says the WHO.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014, and rapidly became the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.
Almost two years on from the first confirmed case recorded on 23 March 2014, more than 11,000 people have been reported as having died from the disease in six countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali.
The total number of reported cases is almost 29,000.
On 13 January, 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the last of the countries affected, Liberia, to be Ebola-free.
Bodily tissues can harbour the Ebola infection months after the person appears to have fully recovered.
Dr Derek Gatherer, lecturer in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University, said it was "now becoming clear that Ebola is a far more complex disease than we previously imagined".
He said: "The meningitis that Ms Cafferkey suffered from at the end of last year is one of the most serious complications of all, as it can be life-threatening.
"The other main rare serious complication is inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis and/or uveitis) which can lead to blindness, especially if supportive treatments are unavailable."
Dr Gatherer said major post-recovery complications included "joint aches, headaches and general tiredness which can last for months".

article The GM Health and Social Care Partnership Board said the move would make 24/7 urgent primary care provision easier for patients to access.
The additional access will revolve around neighbourhood hubs and "clusters" where weekend and evening appointments will be available.
The board said it hopes the plans will reduce pressure on hospital A&E units.
The investment will also provide patients access to a range of other health and social care services such as diagnostics, blood tests and X-rays as well as supporting nursing and residential homes.
Partnership chairman Lord Peter Smith said: "This £41m investment will ensure that our GPs across Greater Manchester are supported to provide high quality care now and in the future.
"Putting primary care back at the heart of our local communities is absolutely the right thing to do and shows how devolution can make gains for patients' right across Greater Manchester."
The plans do not mean that every GP practice in the region will have extra opening hours.
Instead it is envisaged patients having enhanced access at the neighbourhood level through "clusters" of practices working together, supported by a designated hub serving around 50,000 patients.
Dr David Wrigley, a Lancashire GP and BMA Council Deputy Chair, said: "It is good to hear about some new investment into general practice but I am concerned seven-day routine working is being rolled out when GPs struggle to provide a good five-day service, Monday to Friday, due to the years of under investment.
"We are short of thousands of GPs across the country and this new seven-day plan will seek to stretch my colleagues even more thinly across the week."
The board, which took control of the region's £6bn health and social care budget in 2016, was told 2,500 patients who could be treated elsewhere are dealt with every day in A&E units across the region.
The plan will build on some schemes already in operation in Greater Manchester, such as in Bury.
Bury has had full extended GP access in place since January 2015 with weekday appointments available up to 20:00, and from 08:00 to 18:00 at weekends, delivered from three hub sites.
Surgeries in England are currently expected to open between 08:00 and 18:30 on weekdays with extra funding available to those offering slots outside those hours.
But the government wants GPs to stay open longer unless they can prove the demand is not there.

article In Taksim Square, where the heart of this city beats, there is a group of people wrapped up in Turkish flags, shouting "God is great!" in protest at the coup attempt and in support of the government.
This place would normally be packed with tourists, street musicians and people out shopping or having a drink in one of many bars. Now it feels edgy, angry and sad.
"What is happening to our country?" asks an old man. "Brothers are up in arms against each other," meaning the clashes between the coup-plotting soldiers and the security forces loyal to President Erdogan's government.
"I fear there will be more bloodshed. Do you think we will be like Syria?" he asks.
It has been an overwhelming night and day for millions of Turks, glued to their television screens and Twitter feeds, trying to figure out what was happening.
First, the pictures from Istanbul emerged, showing the major bridge over the Bosphorus seized by soldiers. People started to ask: Could this be a coup attempt?
As panic struck, the unease started spreading from adults to children. I was then still in Izmir, the third biggest city in Turkey, trying desperately to make my way to Istanbul.
The 11-year-old son of a friend travelling with me was in shock, crying, not knowing exactly what was happening and asking his father whether Turkey was at war now. His father tried to console him: "Everything will be OK."
Soon after the prime minister confirmed that this was indeed a coup attempt, carried out by a faction within the army, I saw people queuing in front of bakeries to buy bread, at petrol stations to buy fuel, at ATMs to withdraw as much money as they could.
It felt surreal - even for a country that has witnessed three coups and two further military interventions in the past.
Live pictures from Istanbul showed a local news channel's premises being raided when it was still on air. Soldiers were not seen on camera, but scuffles were heard. And gunfire.
People were constantly tweeting about the explosions: Was that a sound bomb or a major attack nearby, they were asking.
In the capital city Ankara, scenes were even more dramatic. Gunfire on the streets, tanks on the march, jets flying low over government buildings, helicopters hovering over the parliament.
At one point during the night, millions of Turkish citizens watched their parliament come under fire by helicopter attack live on television. The MPs shared their latest whereabouts on Twitter - taking refuge, packed in the shelters.
Never in Turkey's modern history had parliament been hit - even at the most turbulent times. It was a significant moment, symbolising the wound opened in the heart of Turkish democracy.
Almost everything was live on air. President Erdogan's in-vision call to a news channel was one of the iconic moments, when he called on everyone to take to the streets. Many imams repeated his call from mosques via megaphones. "We call on all to go out to public squares," they said.
And crowds answered the call. Soon there emerged pictures of men on top of tanks, beaten-up soldiers, jubilant anti-coup protestors. Dozens of rebels abandoned their positions.
The government says the coup attempt is over, blaming the movement supporting US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. They deny any sort of involvement.
But after at least 265 dead, 1,440 wounded, nearly 3,000 soldiers arrested, and more than 2,700 judges dismissed, many Turks wonder: how will Turkey cope with the trauma it just went through?
summary Turkey's president Erdogan has been a target of a riot in Istanbul.

It is part of the £850m development which is to replace the St James Centre at the east end of Princes Street.
Work is due to start on the development by the end of the year.
The site, which is to have luxury apartments, 30 restaurants and a multi-screen cinema, is due to be completed in 2020.
Heinz Richardson, director of Jestico + Whiles, said: "We are thrilled to have been selected by TH Real Estate to be part of one of the biggest and most exciting regeneration projects currently under way in the UK.
"The contemporary design will be sympathetic to the surrounding World Heritage site and its history, providing a first-class destination for Edinburgh at the heart of the city's new retail quarter."
Martin Perry, director of development TIAA Henderson Real Estate, which appointed Jestico + Whiles, said: "Jestico + Whiles has a well-deserved reputation for its excellent work on a number of prestigious hotel and leisure facilities throughout the world.
"The team demonstrated a thorough understanding and imagination for what we would like to achieve for Edinburgh St James which was reflected in their proposals.
"The final hotel design is likely to be influenced by the operator and given Edinburgh is continuing to prove a highly attractive destination with a growing tourist economy and strong finance market, we are encouraged by the response we have received from interested parties so far."

Bempton Cliffs is the biggest mainland colony for birds in England. Around 200,000 seabirds flock there, but the experts are seeing a decline in numbers of several species including the puffin.

article Flowers, 63, was arrested last November after newspaper allegations he had been involved in a drug deal.
The suspended Methodist minister had stepped down from the Co-op six months earlier over concerns about expenses.
He was fined £400 and ordered to pay £125 in costs after pleading guilty to charges of possessing cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine.
He had earlier apologised for "stupid and wrong" behaviour, saying he had been under pressure because of problems at the bank and the recent death of his mother.
During the 10-minute hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors said Flowers had been filmed handing over £300 for drugs in a car in Leeds last November.
The footage was subsequently sold to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, the judge was told.
Flowers admitted the offence to police and said he had taken cocaine for about 18 months to "keep himself going" while he was suffering stress and caring for his then terminally ill mother.
Flowers' barrister, Richard Wright QC, said his client had a current income of £510 a month from pensions and unspecified assets inherited from his mother.
Outside court, Flowers said only: "Don't ask me any questions because I won't give any answers."
His appearance in court came on the day a review of the Co-op Group by former board member Lord Myners said the organisation should adopt a much smaller board and focus on being profitable in order to survive.
Lord Myners said the group's current board was "manifestly dysfunctional" and needed more members with business experience.
Flowers, who oversaw the near-collapse of the group's banking arm, previously served as a Labour councillor in Bradford and on an informal board advising Labour leader Ed Miliband on banking.
He was suspended by the Labour Party and the Methodist Church following the drug allegations and faces a disciplinary procedure by the Church.
His appointment as Co-op Bank chairman in April 2010 was widely criticised because of his inexperience in banking.
In May last year, the Co-op Bank was found to have a £1.5bn black hole in its finances.
Flowers stepped down the following month.
In November, Flowers was called to appear before Parliament's Treasury Select Committee to discuss his management of the bank.
After his appearance, the committee's chairman Andrew Tyrie said Flowers was "manifestly unsuitable" to be chairman of a bank.
The bank has since agreed a refinancing deal which saw the Co-op Group's stake fall to 30%.
US institutions now hold the other 70%.
Flowers is also a former trustee of the drugs charity Lifeline, from which he resigned in 2004 after allegedly filing false expenses claims.

article He is passionate about a species of which its mere existence is hotly debated: Wild big cats in the UK.
"I know they are out there," said Mr Tunbridge, who has spent nearly 25 years investigating Gloucestershire's reported big cats.
He said that on average he received two sightings a week from across the county.
His passion is equalled by that of Rick Minter, 50, who has written a book about big cats in the wilds of Britain.
"The main candidates for the larger types of feral big cats being reported in Britain are puma-type cats and panthers," he said.
"A puma is a sandy-grey coloured cat, also known as cougar and mountain lion. A black panther is biologically a leopard or a jaguar in its black form."
Mr Minter admitted some people just found the idea of big cats roaming wild in the English countryside too incredible to believe.
"You do feel largely like you are beavering away in your own little world," he said.
"Then, suddenly January 2012 comes along and half the nation's media are tracking your every step.
"You're suddenly engulfed with emails and reporters and programmes wanting to know about the latest deer carcass or your view on 'X' in relation to big cats."
The incident he refers to came about when the National Trust announced that it had called for DNA tests to be carried out on a deer carcass found on its land near Stroud, Gloucestershire.
A trust spokesman had initially said the deer's injuries - and way the carcass had been eaten by its killer - were thought to be "highly indicative of big cat activity".
But three weeks later the results are back and they are negative to the idea of a big cat predator. Fox and deer DNA are the only traces found on the swabs taken.
But Mr Tunbridge said he still believed the big cats were out there - and said he had his own close encounter to prove it.
"It was dead quiet," he said, remembering a night he spent tracking wildlife near Minchampton, Stroud, last September.
"You could hear a pin drop, and this big cat growled behind me - just warning me.
"Through my night vision equipment I just saw it swoop down, sweep up a rabbit and disappear into a small wood.
"They are so elusive, so stealthy - especially leopards and pumas - they see you before you see them."
Mr Minter, meanwhile, said he had seen three big cats in the wild - a black panther in Cumbria, a puma-like cat in a Cotswold woodland and a smaller cat, "like a jungle cat", near the River Severn in Gloucester.
Between June 2007 and April 2011, Gloucestershire Police took 38 calls about big cat sightings.
According to the force's records, most of the animals were described as large black cats although there was one reported sighting of a lion.
So, why would big cats be found in the far-from-tropical conditions of the Cotswolds?
Both of the big cat hunters said they believed the most likely explanation is that such animals have been released from domestic situations and small private collections.
Following the introduction of the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act, more costly and rigorous conditions were applied for keeping such animals.
Natural England, the government's advisory body on the natural environment, has stated it is confident there is no breeding big cat population in this country.
A spokesman said reports were occasionally received, but no sightings had ever been confirmed and the evidence it had looked at had either been unsubstantiated or attributed to other causes.
But this is not the line taken by those who are convinced they have seen, heard or tracked a big cat in the wild.
As for DNA testing of animal carcasses, previous cases have shown up different results, Mr Minter said.
He claimed that in 2003, tests on a black animal hair found after a sighting in Lincolnshire gave positive results for a leopard.
Two years later, DNA results consistent with a puma were found on a hair recovered after sightings in Neath, South Wales.
And in 2009 the  
          Forestry Commission confirmed
 that rangers had twice spotted big cats while conducting deer surveys in the Forest of Dean.
"Recent community surveys have indicated a strong desire for big cat evidence to be researched as robustly as possible, and for all aspects of this subject to be considered in a responsible way," added Mr Minter.
"We are coming to a time when we must learn about them."

article The US economy added 235,000 new jobs in February, Mr Trump's first full month in office.
He retweeted a news report with the caption: "GREAT AGAIN".
During a campaign speech last August, Mr Trump called the Department of Labor numbers one of the "biggest hoaxes in American modern politics".
Challenged about this contradiction at Friday's daily news briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Mr Trump believes, "they may have been phony in the past but it's very real now."
The latest figures brought down the US unemployment rate from 4.8% to 4.7%, the report found.
Much of the growth is being attributed by analysts to an unusually clement few weeks, allowing construction projects and hiring to continue uninterrupted.
Last month was the warmest February on record.
Two years ago in a press conference, Mr Trump attacked the official unemployment rate, calling it "such a phony number" and "the biggest joke".
He asserted that some "great economists" estimate the real US jobless rate is as high as 32% or 42%.
PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, rated this claim as "pants on fire" false.
Mr Trump's US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during his confirmation hearing that "the unemployment rate is not real".

article Her call came the day after it was announced Scotland would face a £176.8m cut in public spending this year.
Chancellor George Osborne announced a £3bn cut in UK departmental budgets for 2015/16 and the knock-on for Scotland.
In a letter to the four opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon said the parties "must speak with a united voice".
The letter was sent to Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Scottish Green Patrick Harvie.
It said: "I hope that you will agree with me that all parties in Scotland must unite in making clear to the UK government that it is unacceptable for reductions to be imposed on this year's Scottish Budget.
"Not only do such reductions have a potentially damaging impact on our programmes and public services, but the chancellor's approach shows little respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament itself in approving the annual devolved Scottish Budget."
Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to argue for an alternative to the UK government's austerity programme.
This would involve a "moderate increase" in public spending of 0.5% a year in real terms between 2016-17 and 2019-20, she said.
Mr Osborne made his cuts announcement ahead of his emergency budget, which will take place on 8 July.
The Tory chancellor said he believed it was vital to tackle UK debt "as quickly as possible".
The UK government has pledged to clear the deficit by 2018/19.
Mr Osborne must find a further £30bn of savings over the next three years, including £12bn from welfare spending and £13bn from government departments.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: "Nicola Sturgeon doesn't seem to understand that if Britain is going to prosper for the long-term, it needs to pay its way in the world and no longer pass on multi-billion pound deficits for our children and grand-children to pay off."
He added: "The truth is that the time when the SNP could resort to its age-old tactic of whipping up grievance over UK government decisions is over.
"Tax-raising powers are coming to the Scottish Parliament, so if it wants to act, it can."
Mr Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said he opposed the UK government cuts but "the Tories are unlikely to listen".
He said: "The real challenge will be to achieve unity in the Scottish Parliament to use our own devolved power to achieve fairer taxation and protection of the public services we all depend on."

article Mr Mladic faces 11 charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity, dating to the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
He is specifically accused of a hand in the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys at Srebrenica - Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
Mr Mladic denies all charges and has denounced the UN tribunal as "satanic".
At the session on Tuesday, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that there were still good grounds to try Mr Mladic on two counts of genocide.
The charges relate to the killings at Srebrenica, and to the expulsion of the Muslim Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serb populations in a wartime campaign that came to be known as "ethnic cleansing".
Lawyers for Mr Mladic had argued that there was not enough evidence linking him to the most serious of the crimes.
However, Judge Alphons Orie said "that the accused has a case to answer on all counts", citing material presented by prosecutors, including video footage of Mr Mladic calling on revenge against the Muslims of Srebrenica.
Mr Mladic is also charged in connection with the 44-month siege of Sarajevo during which more than 10,000 people died.

article Carwyn Jones thinks the lesson is that the party must show it is distinctly Welsh.
Voters aren't interested if they suspect someone in London is pulling the strings, he says.
"We suffered in 1999 because we were seen as a party being controlled by London and we have to accept that. That's not the case any more."
Between now and polling day on May 5 he'll be doing his best to convince you that Labour has learned that lesson over the last 17 years.
Labour wants its campaign to have a distinctly Welsh flavour. That's why its Welsh leader will be front and centre throughout.
He wants another five years in power to complete a "decade of delivery" that started in 2011.
But opponents say he's had long enough to deliver. He's been first minister since 2009. Labour has led the Welsh government since 1999.
On a campaigning visit to a day care nursery in Cardiff, he brushes aside that criticism.
"I think we've delivered a huge amount for people," he says.
He cites "ground breaking laws" on organ donation and Aston Martin's recently announced plans to build luxury cars in south Wales.
Were it not for devolution, "we would have a junior doctors' strike".
But the opposition parties see it differently. Were it not for Welsh Labour's devolved government, we'd have shorter waiting times in the NHS, according to the Conservatives.
Labour's record in the health service will be the big battle ground in the election - an election Mr Jones says is "a straight fight" with the Tories.
He says UKIP pose a threat to Labour too, but in our interview - as in his Welsh Labour conference speech last month - he doesn't mention Plaid Cymru at all.
It's a reflection of Labour's strategy to convince voters this is an either/or election: either keep Carwyn Jones as first minister, or hand over the reins to Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader.
But could that strategy be undone by the spectacle of Labour MPs feuding with each other in Westminster since Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader after last year's general election defeat?
"What we've seen in London hasn't helped. Nobody could pretend otherwise," he says.
"It's calmer there now but people don't like parties which are fighting with each other."
He adds: "What we've said to people is as Welsh Labour we're united. We've got a programme going into the election. I'm the leader.
"And the policies that we will develop in Wales, the policies we will put in our manifesto, are all crafted in Wales.
There's no influence over those policies in terms of our colleagues in London. They wouldn't seek to influence our policies anyway."
Mr Jones likes to call his Welsh government a "pro-business government".
I ask him whether that's his coded way of distancing his administration in Cardiff from the left-wing politics of Mr Corbyn and his supporters.
"No. This is my way of differentiating Welsh Labour as a party. I would do this regardless of what the situation was in London," he says.
"We've done it in elections past. People in Wales want to support parties that they feel have a degree of autonomy, enough of a degree of autonomy, that makes them a properly Welsh party with roots in Wales."
He denies that his "decade of delivery" is a hint that, if he wins, he's planning to stand down at 2021 election.
He and wife Lisa have a son Ruairi and daughter Seren, both of whom are at school. Does he ever wonder about life away politics - a life where he could spend more time with them?
"The honest answer is yes, it has been difficult for the family. My children have only know me as a minister and you do make sacrifices in this job.
"When I get spare time I do spend time with the family. It means you've not got much time for anything else."
But he adds: "I love the job. It's for other people to decide whether I stay in it obviously. You couldn't do this job if you didn't like it."
Those other people - the voters - will make their decision on May 5.

article New figures show there were 14,670 households accepted as homeless between July and September, the largest number since 2008.
According to Shelter, more than 103,000 children will spend Christmas in B&Bs, hostels or temporary rented homes.
Ministers said the figures were still half the 2003 and 2004 peak.
Department for Communities and Local Government statistics show there were 68,560 families in temporary housing from July to September this year, compared with 60,900 in the same three months of 2014.
And 53,480 of those were households with children, compared with 45,590 at the same time the year before.
Shelter said a quarter of all homeless households living in temporary accommodation in England had been moved away to another council area.
The figures showed 18,600 homeless households moved to another area, more than three times as many as in 2010.
Families in temporary accommodation outside their local areas are under particular strain, according to Shelter.
They are "uprooted and moved away from jobs, schools and support networks with no idea when, or even if, they will be able to return", says chief executive Campbell Robb.
But four in ten homeless households in temporary accommodation find themselves in this position, the latest figures show.
This is more than three times the figure for the same period in 2010 when 5,880 households were in temporary accommodation in another local authority area.
Families in bed and breakfast hotels who have to share kitchens and bathrooms often rely on kitchen facilities of relatives or friends to cook healthy food, a Shelter researcher explained.
One woman, offered temporary accommodation in a city hundreds of miles from home, turned it down as she would have lost her job and her children would have been forced to change schools.
Frequent changes of school and long journeys can be very disrupting for children, the researcher added.
Councils are finding it far harder to find homeless households local accommodation due to "a severe drought of affordable homes and drastic cuts to council budgets", Mr Robb added.
The problem is particularly acute in London where one in three families in temporary accommodation are outside their original areas.
Communities Minister Marcus Jones said: "We are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in our society. The protection of the Homelessness Prevention Grant in the Local Government Finance Settlement shows our continued commitment to tackling homelessness.
"Statutory homelessness acceptances are now less than half the 2003 to 2004 peak but we are determined to ensure that anybody who needs help gets it.
"We have made over £500m available since 2010, which has prevented nearly a million people becoming homeless. We are committed to build on this over the next four years and work with the sector to do all we can to prevent homelessness."
New measures include protecting homelessness prevention for local authorities and £40m from the Department of Health to refurbish hostels and provide low cost shared accommodation for young people. There will also be £30m extra for councils' homelessness budgets and a £5m fund for the 25 local authorities facing the greatest pressures moving people from temporary to settled homes.
The councils sharing the funding are: Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Birmingham, Brent, Bromley, Brighton and Hove, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Hounslow , Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Lewisham, Luton, Newham, Redbridge, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster
Shelter said the figures meant 109,000 children in England, Scotland and Wales would be in a hostel or temporary accommodation on 25 December, 103,430 of them in England.
Chief executive of Shelter, Campbell Robb, said:  "These figures are a heart-breaking reminder that thousands of families will wake up homeless this Christmas morning - many hidden away in a cramped and dingy B&B or hostel room, sometimes miles away from everyone and everything they know.
"With the double blow of cuts to welfare and a chronic lack of affordable housing, many more families are facing a desperate battle to keep a roof over their heads.
"Our advisors will be working non-stop to support the 109,000 children who'll be homeless this Christmas, but we're struggling to keep up with demand. That's why we urgently need more support from the public to help us make sure that no-one is left to fight bad housing or homelessness on their own."
A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils finding it difficult to house homeless people because of a shortage of affordable homes and funding pressures.
He added: "It is important that councils have the funding and flexibilities to help those who find themselves homeless or at risk of homelessness. Local authorities also need the power to invest in building more homes that local communities can genuinely afford."
A person is considered "statutorily homeless" by the government if they no longer have a legal right to occupy their accommodation or if it would no longer be reasonable to live there, for example if it would lead to violence against them.
Other reasons included no longer being able to stay with family or friends, relationship breakdown and mortgage arrears leading to repossession.
summary The number of people living in accommodation in the UK is on the rise, according to Shelter.

article Eric Laurent and Catherine Graciet, who are writing a book on King Mohammed VI, were reportedly detained after being handed cash by a Moroccan official.
A lawyer for the Moroccan government told France's RTL radio that Mr Laurent contacted the royal palace in July to demand â‚¬3 million (Â£2.2m; $3.4m).
Mr Laurent allegedly warned the palace about damaging revelations in the book.
"A sum of money was handed over and accepted" at a meeting between the journalist and a Moroccan government official, according to France's AFP news agency.
The publishing company Editions du Seuil confirmed that the pair, who have already written one book about the Moroccan monarch, were working on a second volume due for publication early next year.
Moroccan website Le360.ma, which has close ties to the palace, reported details of how Moroccan representatives held two meetings with Mr Laurent that were monitored by police.
The journalists were then arrested after leaving a restaurant with an alleged down payment, the report said.
Mr Laurent and Ms Graciet's 2012 book, Predator King, was critical of Mohammed VI, detailing how his fortune had ballooned since taking the throne in 1999.
Moroccan law prohibits criticising the king, with a possible penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone who does so.

article Graciam Kondowe was among 54 passengers who police say survived after the boat overturned in stormy weather on Sunday.
Five people drowned while 11 are still missing, police said.
The boat was packed with worshippers returning from Easter celebrations when it capsized in the remote Rumphi district in northern Malawi.
Mr Kondowe told Malawi's privately owned Zodiac radio station that heavy winds buffeted the boat about 15 minutes into their journey.
The crew decided to return to shore, but the boat capsized before they could get back, he added.
Mr Kondowe said he held on to a bag of maize flour which fell out of the boat, and eventually swam his way to safety.
Eight of the 54 survivors are being treated in hospital after sustaining injuries, police officer Denis Banda said.
Locals residents used canoes to rescue most of the passengers, Malawian journalist Joab Chakhaza told the BBC.
Search operations are continuing for the 11 people still missing, but the chances of finding them alive are slim, he adds.
Boats are a common mode of transport on the vast Lake Malawi, and accidents of this magnitude are rare.
In 2012, 47 migrants fleeing drought and conflict in Somalia and Ethiopia drowned in the lake after their boat capsized.

article Zhang Chunxian vowed to use "iron fists" on separatists in the region, Xinhua news agency says.
The warning comes on the anniversary of deadly ethnic riots that saw almost 200 people killed in 2009.
Rights group Amnesty International has accused China of intimidating the ethnic Uighur minority.
Xinjiang province is the country's most westerly region and borders former Soviet states.
China witnessed its worst ethnic violence in decades when riots erupted between the majority Han Chinese and the minority Uighurs in the capital city of Urumqi, says the BBC's Martin Patience.
The Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have lived in China's shadow for centuries, accuse Beijing of religious and political persecution.
Mr Zhang, who is Communist Party secretary of the Xinjiang committee, urged soldiers to remain vigilant against hostile forces and strike separatists, terrorists and extremists with ''iron fists'', Xinhua says.
"We should leave terrorists no place to hide," he said, adding that the region was stable but faced "severe challenges".
London-based rights group Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement saying that Chinese authorities "continue to silence those speaking out on abuses" in the region.
"The general trend toward repression that we see all over China is particularly pronounced in Xinjiang," Catherine Baber, AI Asia-Pacific director,  
          said in a statement
.
She urged the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts of those who have disappeared and end the persecution of family members seeking answers.
On Monday, there were reports that two Uighur men who allegedly tried to hijack a plane in Xinjiang had died.

Stokes was hit for four consecutive sixes in the last over by Carlos Brathwaite as the West Indies beat England in a dramatic final on Sunday.
"He is an outstanding talent and an outstanding cricketer," said Cook.
"He is the type of character who will deal with it, and he will still be the Ben Stokes who can score 250 in a Test match," added the 31-year-old opener.
"It was outstanding hitting. 'Stokesy' would certainly have his first ball again but the second one wasn't too far off the mark and it went 94 metres back."
Cook admitted he was devastated by England's defeat, telling BBC Essex: "I don't normally get too emotional watching a game of cricket.
"It was a brilliant tournament for everyone, it's just a shame that last over didn't quite go to plan."
Cook's county, Essex, begin a new era under newly-appointed coach Chris Silverwood on Sunday against Gloucestershire.
The left-hander, England's leading run-scorer in Test cricket, is available to play in the Division Two opener at Chelmsford.
"In any elite sport you do need freshening up at certain times," Cook said. "I think it was fairly obvious after seven or eight years it was time for a change.
"We've been the nearly men for the last four or five years. We've been close to promotion a number of times.
"Everyone is excited about the beginning of the season. Every county will be thinking they've got the chance to have a good year."

article The report from David Strang, chief inspector of prisons for Scotland, made 41 recommendations to improve performance at the jail.
However he said the report was "good" overall, with positive points raised about food, visiting arrangements and staff-prisoner relationships.
The jail was inspected in December.
The prison, Scotland's oldest, was built in 1810 by Napoleonic prisoners of war and has an agreed capacity of 631. At the time of inspection, there were a total of 626 prisoners held there.
The jail has previously been criticised for overcrowding.
Mr Strang said the standard of accommodation at the prison was "reasonable", but noted: "Some cells are designed as single cell accommodation were regularly occupied by two people, and were extremely cramped with insufficient room to move around in."
He also reported that while prisoners have "good access to a varied regime" including work, education and recreation, "work party spaces are insufficient, which results in some prisoners spending longer periods of time within their cells".
Between 1 January and 30 November there were 94 recorded violent incidents in the prison, including nine attacks on staff, 48 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, and 37 fights between prisoners. The prison authorities responded to this by introducing a revised violence reduction strategy.
Mr Strang concluded that "overall this is a good report for HMP Perth", and said the inspectorate would continue to monitor progress made in relation to the 41 recommendations.

article Apple won a ban on the devices, claiming Samsung had copied its iPhone and iPad.
South Korean Samsung had been unable to sell products in Australia since July.
The two companies are engaged in legal battles in more than 10 countries since April accusing each other of infringing smartphone and tablet patents.
Last month, Samsung won an appeal against a temporary ban on sales.
However, Apple was awarded a stay of the orders. On Friday Apple's bid to extend the ban was turned down by the High Court.
The ruling is a rare win for Samsung as it allows the company to sell its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in time for the busy Christmas shopping season, a lucrative time for the industry.
The decision comes after a US court ruled against Apple's bid to ban Galaxy phones and tablets, another win for Samsung. Apple has appealed against that ruling.
However, the legal tussle in other markets is not going as well for Samsung.
The company said on Friday that a French court had turned down its request to ban sale of the latest iPhone in that country.

article The principality's vast harbour is littered with huge yachts belonging to those rich people who are not only proud of the trappings of their station in life, but are always looking for different ways to display it.
One story I heard was of a super yacht owner who had just found a new use for his vessel - the school run.
But for some, a mega yacht on its own is no longer enough - you need the latest accessories too. Amongst the newest of these is a machine whose time, advocates say, has come - the "personal" submarine.
Several of the latest models were on display in Monaco, including some from a small US company - DeepFlight.
It was founded by the British engineer, inventor and entrepreneur Graham Hawkes, who has had an extraordinary career.
For many years he held a world record for solo depth diving; he's invented a robotic machine-gun; and he's played the part of a villain in a James Bond film. He designed and operated a small sub used in an underwater battle in the movie, For Your Eyes Only.
BBC presenter Peter Day and I first met Mr Hawkes in California several years ago. At the time he was obsessed with the idea of building a craft capable of going right to the bottom of the ocean.
Beaten to it by film director James Cameron, who accomplished the feat in 2012, he steered his business in a new direction.
Now, his company makes a range of submersible craft aimed at the super yacht crowd, marine researchers, and others.
One of the selling points of machines like these, says Mr Hawkes, is that they enable astonishing experiences.
Once, when he was taking the entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson on an underwater trip, they had a memorable encounter with a great white shark, which swam past them.
"It was bigger than this submersible", he recalls. "I was looking straight in to this eye of this huge predator and I was just in awe. And Richard was saying 'Graham, get closer, get closer'.
"And all I remember saying is 'Richard, I'm not going to lunge at a great white shark'. But we ended up laughing and giggling after that, we were so happy."
The devices made by DeepFlight differ from some other small subs because they are "positively buoyant," and need force or motion to keep them underwater.
If thrust disappears for any reason, the craft will float back to the surface - a feature which Mr Hawkes claims offers safety benefits.
The Super Falcon model works in a similar way to an aircraft, he explains: "It has 'wings' and you need to get some speed, about a walking speed on the surface, and then you point it down and the wings pull it down… and it flies under water. "
Another model, the Dragon, works more like a helicopter, and can "hover" underwater.
Small submarines have been around for many years but it is only comparatively recently that the market for them has begun to take off.
"My partner and I were at yacht shows twenty years ago with manned submersibles and bigger diesel electric luxury submarines," recalls another Monaco exhibitor, L. Bruce Jones of Florida-based Triton Submarines.
"And people would walk by our booth and sort of snicker at us - what are those crazy guys doing here?
"But now, fast forward twenty years and we're being accepted."
One reason for this change lies in recent advances in technology, which have helped to lower manufacturing costs, and also enabled the production of more versatile craft, with many additional features.
Triton's range includes battery-powered subs that can dive down to depths of hundreds of metres for many hours before needing to return to the surface.
Another development, that is proving popular with customers, is the huge increase in the size of windows.
"In the old days you used to have this big steel pressure hull with small windows," says Erik Hasselman of Dutch sub makers U-Boat Worx, which is also exhibiting its products at the Monaco show.
Mr Hasselman says that recent improvements in acrylic technology mean that "we can build these very large acrylic spheres that will allow people to have a really big window," and thus get a much better view of what is happening beneath the waves.
None of this comes cheap. Prices for the smallest personal submersible craft start at around $1.5m (£1m). The high cost is likely to ensure that these products remain the preserve of the wealthy, commercial users, and well-funded research bodies.
However sub-makers also see the possibility of substantial growth in the leisure market, in which operators are already offering tourists underwater trips in small submarines.
If that happens, then increasing attention may start to be focused on the health of the world's oceans - something that many scientists are deeply concerned about.
At the moment, says Mr Hawkes, this issue can seem remote to many people.
But, he asks, "what if the politician …what if the fisherman, what if the housewife who was worried about the damage to the ocean could have gone and seen? … The important thing is that, [today] nobody can go, nobody can see.
"We're trying to change that."

article He takes over from Paul Shaw, who stepped down as England women's head of performance in September.
Robinson, 48, was first-team coach at Sussex and scheduled to start his new role at the end of the year, in time for the South Africa tour in February.
"To have the chance to play a part in the next chapter for the England women's team is a great honour," the former right-arm seam bowler said.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had wanted someone with "first-class or international playing or coaching experience" as the women's set-up underwent a restructure.
"He has a superb coaching record with Sussex, experience of working with England teams, a reputation for getting the best out of players, and is highly regarded as one of the best coaches working in the men's professional game," ECB head of women's cricket Clare Connor said.
"The next 18 months are hugely important for the England women's team and the players must quickly get back to winning ways in South Africa."
England, who lost this summer's multi-format Ashes series to Australia, are second in the International Cricket Council's women's team rankings.
Sussex have appointed Mark Davis, 44, as Robinson's successor.
"Robinson has pedigree and is a well-respected coach within the English game, having won two County Championships at Sussex - but they were relegated last season," BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said.
"He has no international experience - that was something Clare Connor said was a key attribute for any successful candidate.
"But Robinson led an England Lions tour to South Africa at the start of 2015, apparently impressing the ECB during the trip.
"This is a step up for the England women with a coach with vast experience at a high level in the men's game, but the pressure is on with success expected at next year's World Twenty20."

article They took the lead when Algeria's Aissa Mandi directed Youssef Msakni's left-wing cross into his own net.
And some dreadful defending by Faouzi Ghoulam led to him bringing down Wahbi Khazri for a penalty which Naim Sliti coolly slotted into the right corner.
Algeria pulled a goal back when Sofiane Hanni struck from the edge of the area.
Tunisia's victory takes them to three points and second place in Group B and leaves Algeria with only one point.
Group leaders Senegal can qualify later on Thursday by beating Zimbabwe.
It means Algeria, who had been one of the pre-tournament favourites, will have to rely on other results going their way if they are to qualify from the group - and they have to face Senegal in their final match.
Tunisia went into the game off the back of a 2-0 defeat to Senegal and anything other than victory against Algeria would have left them in serious trouble.
They were fortunate with their first goal, the ball looping off Mandi's foot to deceive Algerian goalkeeper Malik Asselah, who was playing in place of injured first-choice stopper Rais M'bolhi.
And they were gifted their second when Algeria defender Ghoulam sent an underpowered header back towards his goal and then fouled Khazri who had nipped ahead of him to collect the ball  and bear down on goal. Sliti confidently struck home the spot-kick.
Algeria started the match well and Islam Slimani's point-blank header brought an excellent save from Aymen Mathlouthi, while Riyad Mahrez should have done better with a shot from the edge of the area.
Much of Tunisia's best work involved Kazri - starting for the first time at the tournament - and the Sunderland midfielder tested Asselah early on with a free-kick.
Algeria struggled to rouse themselves after going behind and although substitute Hanni took his chance well, sending a curling shot into the corner, their largely toothless display has left them on the verge of an early exit.

article Fusilier Dean Griffiths, 21, of First Battalion the Royal Welsh, died at Lydd Range, Kent in September 2011.
An inquest in 2013 heard a target was wrongly placed against a wall but there was no evidence it was malicious.
A Crown Censure is the maximum sanction the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) can impose on a government body.
The MoD cannot be prosecuted in the same way as non-government bodies.
Fusilier Griffiths, from Market Drayton, Shropshire, whose partner was pregnant at the time of his death, was serving with the Chester-based battalion as it prepared to go to Afghanistan.
He died during a simulated combat exercise in a compound built to replicate an Afghan building.
The HSE said Fusilier Griffiths was part of an assault group assigned to enter and secure the compound.
The compound contained both enemy and civilian targets made from thin plywood to allow the live bullets to pass through and avoid ricochets.
The HSE said its investigation found unused targets were usually laid on the floor to give the appearance of debris, but on this occasion an unused target was left upright against a wall..
Fusilier Griffiths was behind that target when the wall was breached with a simulated explosion.
As a colleague entered he saw an enemy target and fired two shots, hitting Fusilier Griffiths with a bullet that passed through the incorrectly placed enemy target.
The soldier died at the scene.
HSE said its investigators found the exercise was undermanned.
It said the incident could have been prevented by not using targets as debris and with a final walk through by the Range Conducting Officer to ensure all targets corresponded to the planned exercise.
The MoD admitted breaching its duty under Section 2(1) and 2(2) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

article PC Dave Giboney said moments after Arlindo Furtado stabbed himself in the throat, a colleague discharged his Taser, which missed.
Mr Furtado was later struck twice by Taser shots at his Cardiff home.
The inquest has heard Mr Furtado died from his neck wound, and not as a result of being stunned.
PC Giboney told Aberdare Coroner's Court his colleague and Mr Furtado fell on to the landing floor. He then discharged his Taser, which hit Mr Furtado's left side.
"I feared for my colleague. He was resisting, I did not know what he was going to do. I wanted to protect my colleague and prevent Mr Furtado from harming himself further," the officer said.
Mr Furtado died in hospital after armed police were called to his house in Adeline Street, Splott, on 11 October 2014, resulting in a stand-off lasting several hours.
Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbeatter found evidence of two Taser marks but said they were not the cause of death.
"The wound to the neck is sufficient to cause death," he said.
The inquest heard the day before his death, Mr Furtado told his partner Nicole Varela he would rather die than be without her and his children.
Reading a statement from Ms Varela, the coroner said she had been the victim of a "violent incident at his hands" the day before.
She said Mr Furtado "could be aggressive from time to time" but was also an "excellent father".
The inquest was told Mr Furtado was due to be arrested following allegations of domestic violence.
Police negotiator Det Chf Insp Brian Herd said he felt Mr Furtado was determined to end his life and became increasingly agitated as the afternoon wore on.
Ms Valera disagreed with negotiators who would not allow her to speak to him on a telephone link and believed she could have changed his mind.
DCI Herd said introducing a third person into the situation was a risk he could not take.
On the day before he died, Mr Furtado kept calling Ms Varela "asking for forgiveness" and had logged onto Facebook to say goodbye to family and friends.
The inquest also heard Mr Furtado's ex-partner in Portugal had called police in Cardiff on the day of his death to express concerns about his welfare.
The hearing continues.

article The move was both defensive and ambitious, carrying strong elements of both opportunity and risk.
"Part of the motivation was to avert a humanitarian disaster," said a senior source in Irbil.
"Had we not filled the vacuum left by the Iraqi army's departure, everybody would have flooded into the Kurdistan region. We had half a million people banging on our doors.
"It's a lot simpler to send 100 peshmergas (Kurdish military forces) to hold the fort and keep security, so that people could stay put. Once our units went in, the displaced started going back."
But there's clearly more to it than that. The Kurdish media have been hailing the step as a historic reunification of Kurdish lands.
Kirkuk city, which has a mixed population of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, has long been a thorny issue in Iraqi politics.
Its special status as a disputed city was recognised in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi constitution, which called for the situation in the city to be "normalised" by:
But that has never happened, and Kirkuk, as well as other disputed areas along the Arab-Kurdish ethnic fault line, have been flashpoints for friction between Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops.
Now, the latter have melted away, leaving Kirkuk to fall into the hands of the Kurds like a ripe fruit.
With the rest of Iraq apparently disintegrating along sectarian lines, and the central government in Baghdad in disarray, it will clearly be a long time before an Iraqi authority can challenge the Kurds' absorption of what they have long seen as the rightful jewel in their crown.
The Kurdistan region has already angered Baghdad by going its own way and selling its oil and gas directly to and through its northern neighbour Turkey, with which the regional government (KRG) has developed a close partnership despite historic Turkish suspicions of Kurdish nationalism.
Now it seems likely that the acquisition of Kirkuk, both the city and the province with its rich oilfields, will boost the trend towards outright independence for the Kurdistan region.
"Absolutely, it brings independence a step closer," said a well-placed source.
"We have lost hope in the sanity of the people governing Iraq. We don't want to be part of the failure of something for which we're not responsible. Nobody gave more than us in the effort to keep Iraq together, but now we're giving up, there's no hope."
But the move is not without risks.
It brings Kurdish forces into direct proximity with the militants who have taken over in Mosul and other adjacent areas.
In recent years, Kirkuk has already seen many suicide and other bomb attacks attributed to Sunni radicals, which are very rare inside the KRG autonomous area itself.
If instability spreads, it could affect the current boom in investment and economic activity in Kurdistan, which has flourished while the rest of Iraq has largely stagnated and been mired in turmoil.
If the Sunni areas are starting to go their own way, much will depend on the composition of the dominant forces taking part in that process.
So far, the public face that has resonated around the world has been that of the ultra-radical al-Qaeda offshoot known as ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
But as with the anti-US insurgency from 2004 on, there are clearly other strands to the revolt, which explains the resonance it is having, and the speed of its movement through the mainly Sunni areas on which it is concentrating.
The Kurds have no sympathy for the ISIS radicals, but they are in touch with other elements, including tribal leaders and commanders of the Military Councils of Iraqi Revolutionaries (MCIR), which includes many experienced former Iraqi army officers.
The Kurds have been given assurances from the latter that they will not encroach on the borders of the KRG autonomous region, according to an MCIR spokesman.
The MCIR claims that overall, its fighters are the most significant element in the revolt, with tribal militants in second place, and ISIS only third despite the media attention they command.
When Sunni rebels took over the city of Fallujah, west of Baghdad, in January, Prime Minister Nouri Maliki asked the Kurds to send peshmerga forces to help drive them out, sources say.
But the request was turned down. The Kurdish leadership's message to the MCIR conversely was that Irbil would not be against the Sunnis taking the road of establishing their own autonomous area, following the lead of Kurdistan itself.
That would clearly not apply if ISIS emerged as the dominant force in self-administering Sunni areas. Its philosophy and practices are so extreme that it has even been disavowed by its parent leadership, the international al-Qaeda movement headed by Osama Bin Laden's successor Ayman al-Zawahiri.
A future scenario where the Kurdish forces helped "moderate" elements such as the MCIR to oust ISIS is not hard to envisage.
Already there are signs of a potential conflict between strands of the rebel movement, although they are cooperating for the time being.
"There is no friction or clashes between us at the moment, but we plan to avoid them until we are settled and operations are finished, then we will kick them out of Mosul," said an MCIR source.
"We are warning their leaders that if they perpetrate any violations, they will become our first enemy, so they are behaving so far."
Politically, the clerical body which is the spiritual point of reference for mainstream militant Sunni groups, the Association of Muslim Clerics (AMC), has put out a statement which clearly takes issue with the radical declaration put out by the ISIS spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the day before.
He called for revenge and score-settling in Baghdad, and for the militants to march on the holy Shia city of Karbala to the south of the capital.
That would clearly be a recipe for sectarian carnage and civil war between Sunnis and Shias, something the AMC said is absolutely not on the agenda.
"Calls for the revolutionaries to head for Karbala, Najaf and elsewhere are rejected, unacceptable and irresponsible on the part of those issuing them," the AMC statement said.
"It would stir hostility to the revolution and make it fail, diverting its goal from helping the oppressed to stirring up sectarian conflict between the sons of our one people, quite apart from the fact that everybody knows that most of the Iraqi people in the south reject Maliki and his gang, and suffer his oppression like the rest of us."
The AMC insisted that forgiveness and tolerance should be the keynote in administering the "liberated" areas, and that nothing should be done to prejudice people's livelihoods or impose dress codes on them, even if they were not in line with strict Islamic precepts.
In another clear reference to ISIS, it said that no group should claim to represent the entire revolt and take strategic decisions without consultation.
It also called for the immediate release of the 49 Turkish nationals seized by ISIS from the consulate in Mosul, saying this risked alienating a powerful neighbour and provoking intervention.
But even the AMC embraced the goal of reaching Baghdad, "because the ruling regime is there, the source of oppression and crimes against the people, so there is no other way of lifting the yoke as long as the regime fails to look after others."
So the seeds of an incipient struggle within the rebel movement are clearly there, though the AMC stressed the need to avoid the kind of chaos and in-fighting afflicting opposition groups in the anti-government uprising in Syria.
Clearly, the current Sunni revolt has much more to it than the intrusion of foreign jihadist "terrorists", as Prime Minister Maliki has claimed.
The Americans and others are aware that the turmoil reflects Mr Maliki's failure to draw major Sunni political forces into the political process and give them a stake, one of several factors inhibiting them from producing a forceful and determined response to his appeals for help.
Despite their visible differences, the various elements in the Sunni revolt are agreed on the need to push towards Baghdad, a campaign that is likely to see movement from the western side - Anbar province - as well as from the north.
But as with the Kurds in the north, the course of events will depend a great deal on which strand predominates within the rebel movement.
If ISIS prevails, open-ended sectarian strife can be expected. But if the more moderate groups assert themselves, there may be room for compromise and accommodation.

article The Unite union said around 480 of its members will vote before 13 July on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action.
Unite said members had rejected proposed changes to the pension schemes operated by airport owners AGS, who say they are "committed" to further talks.
Staff involved include security, airfield operations and firefighters.
Unite regional officer Pat McIlvogue said: "Unite has continually tried to negotiate a remedy with AGS over the proposed pensions schemes changes that avoids the need for industrial action and disruption at the two airports.
"Unite put forward a proposal, which would save the company Â£3.5m-a-year, but despite our repeated attempts to reach an amicable solution our efforts have been met with intransigence.
"Unite has no option but to ballot members for industrial action to protect pension provisions that are deferred wages and to strongly oppose AGS's proposed imposition."
A spokesman for AGS Airports Limited said: "Discussions have been ongoing between the company and union representatives regarding changes to the existing final salary (defined benefit) pension scheme since October 2015.
"We remain committed to holding further discussions with union representatives in order to reach a solution that is acceptable to all parties."

article The brewery, which originally aimed to raise £4m in six months, is now looking to raise a further £250,000 from selling more shares to "fanvestors".
The new target is the maximum sum which can be raised through such a scheme.
Crowdfunding is a way of raising equity by asking a large number of people each for a small amount of money.
Overall, Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog has raised almost £7m through investors buying shares in the business during three rounds of Equity for Punks.
The current round, which is due to be completed in January, has raised £3.7m so far.
The brewer said the extra funds raised would further boost the expansion of its bar division as well as fund a new series of "bottle shops" across the UK designed to cater for a growing demand for craft beer.
The company, which now employs 200 staff, reported it was on track to achieve turnover of £19m in 2013.
BrewDog co-founder James Watt said: "It has been an epic response to Equity for Punks this year, and we now have over 12,000 shareholders all over the world.
"It's this phenomenal response that has made it clear we are going to sell the full £4m allocation of shares well before our January deadline, so we are pushing the limit even further.
"Through Equity for Punks we have shown that far from a buzzword or a fad, crowdfunding is a legitimate alternative financial system.
"We have broken all records, and silenced all doubters, and now we want to ensure all the fans that have supported us have a chance to buy a share of BrewDog."

article The man from Croydon, south London, was arrested in the early hours after he was seen by officers who were monitoring CCTV cameras.
He was arrested at 04:15 BST within a security perimeter. He did not gain access to the palace.
The Met said the suspected intruder had been drinking and that the incident was not thought to be terrorism related.
The force added the man was not armed and no Taser was deployed by officers.
He is currently being held in a central London police station.
No member of the royal family was in residence.
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson declined to comment.
There have been several breaches at the Palace, including in May when a 41-year-old man was arrested in the grounds after an alarm went off.
Last year two men got on to the roof of the Queen's Gallery, close to the palace, as part of a protest over fathers' rights while in 2013, a man scaled a fence and was arrested inside a room which was open to the public during the day.
A more notable breach was in 1982 when Michael Fagan got into the Queen's bedroom and spent 10 minutes talking to her before she managed to raise the alarm when he asked for a cigarette.

article The proposed "European Security Markets Authority" would initially regulate credit rating agencies, but could be given broader powers at a later date.
The agencies gave their highest "AAA" rating to billions of dollars of debts that went bad in the financial crisis.
Michel Barnier, the commissioner behind the proposal, has also advocated a single European banking regulator.
The internal market commissioner wants national regulators to transfer all their supervision powers over the rating agencies to the new authority.
"In contrast to banks and insurance companies, rating services are not linked to particular territories," the Commission said in a press release.
US inquiry grills ratings agency
"The changes to rules on credit rating agencies will mean better supervision and increased transparency in this crucial sector," said Mr Barnier.
"But they are only a first step," he added. "We are looking at this market in more detail."
The rating agencies have been accused on both sides of the Atlantic of being a major culprit in the financial crisis.
In the US, a Congressional inquiry committee was due on Wednesday to question senior managers at rating agency Moody's, as well as billionaire investor Warren Buffett, about the agencies' role in the crisis.
In Europe, Mr Barnier criticised the rating agencies in May for their rapid downgrade of Greece's debts to "junk" status.
"I think we need to go further to look at the impact of the ratings on the financial system or economic system as a whole," he said at the time.
"The power of these agencies is quite considerable not only for companies but also for states."
The rating agencies stand accused of a conflict of interests, as their fees were paid for by the banks whose deals they were rating.
Under Mr Barnier's proposal, banks would be forced to disclose full details on their financial transactions to all the rating agencies.
The Commission hopes that this will encourage other rating agencies to provide unsolicited - and more impartial - ratings for these deals.
However, it is unclear what financial incentive there would be for them to provide these competing ratings.
Separately, the Commission has also published a proposal paper on changing the way in which financial institutions such as banks are governed.
Directors and major shareholders in banks have been criticised for allowing the banks' management to take on too much risk prior to the financial crisis.
The proposals include:
The corporate governance "green paper" is only intended to stimulate discussion, and the Commission does not expect to propose any specific new legislation on until 2011.
summary A new European Commission body could be set up to regulate credit ratings agencies.

article Brokers say that, in recent years, the best deals were only available to those offering a large deposit, but there were now signs of change.
However, a new record rate five-year mortgage, newly on sale, still requires a 40% deposit.
The HSBC mortgage, with a rate of 1.99%, also comes with a ??1,499 fee.
Earlier this month, lenders told the Bank of England that demand for new mortgages had fallen for a third successive quarter.
The bank's Credit Conditions Survey found that demand for mortgages for high-value property saw the biggest fall since the third quarter of 2008.
Having been concentrated on this market, there are now signals that banks and building societies are casting their net a little wider.
The survey found that lenders were showing a greater willingness to lend to borrowers who were only able to offer a deposit of less than 10% of the property's value so far this year.
"The lenders are stepping up the fight to attract new borrowers and rates are still getting cheaper," said Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.
"First-time buyers with a 5% deposit can take a fixed rate just over 4% and if they can raise a 10% deposit the rates are as low as 2.69%.
"A few years ago borrowers needed a 40% deposit to access a really good mortgage, but now rates are cheap for most new buyers.
"HSBC's latest fixed rate really takes the mortgage price war into new territory and even cheaper deals may well filter through to the market."
Nearly two-thirds of mortgage holders are sticking to a variable rate as the Bank of England's base rate is showing no signs of rising from its historic low of 0.5%.
Charlotte Nelson, of financial information service Moneyfacts, said that 15 lenders had cut mortgage rates in a week - partly to try to tempt some variable rate customers back to fixed rates.
"The competition to be the lowest in the mortgage market shows no signs of stopping and is great news for borrowers," she said.
All this appears to be good news for first-time buyers struggling to afford a property.
Yet, there are still significant hurdles for these, generally young, potential property owners.
The most eye-catching deals - such as HSBC's home loan which is said to be the first five-year mortgage with a rate of under 2% - can still come with significant fees and deposit requirements.
Ms Nelson said borrowers needed to consider the whole package to work out the cost of the loan.
Borrowers also face strict affordability checks that test whether they are able to cope with an interest rate rise.
Property website Rightmove also reported a rise in average asking prices, suggesting homes are becoming less affordable for first-time buyers.
It said new sellers' asking prices increased by 1.6%, or ??4,381, in April compared with March to reach ??286,133 on average across England and Wales, surpassing a previous peak reached last June.

article Belfast's MAC is the 500th member of Breastfeeding Welcome Here, in which venues show their support for the scheme by displaying a pink sticker.
A list of scheme members - from cafÃ©s to libraries and church halls - can be found on the BreastFedBabies website.
The Department of Health says NI's breastfeeding rates have remained static for several years.
Mothers in Northern Ireland who choose to breastfeed also do so for a shorter period than breastfeeding mothers elsewhere in the UK, according to department figures.
The Breastfeeding Welcome Here initiative is being led by the Public Health Agency (PHA) and is designed to show community support for breastfeeding mothers.
Janet Calvert of the PHA said World Breastfeeding Week from 1-7 August offered an important opportunity to get that message across.
"Breastfeeding is the best start in life," she said.
"Showing increased support for breastfeeding mums is really important, as Northern Ireland has the lowest breastfeeding rates in the UK and one of the lowest rates in Europe.
"We know that for many mums, getting started isn't easy.
Information and support is essential, both before baby is born, and especially in the early days, so that mums can build their confidence and stay with their decision to breastfeed.
In January, the then health minister Michelle O'Neill promised to bring forward legislation as soon as possible to protect mothers who breastfeed in public.
This was shortly before the collapse of Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive.

article Cabozantinib has the potential to switch off tumours in some patients and could give them many months of good-quality life, doctors said.
Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the UK with around 12,000 new cases every year.
The drug has already been approved for use in Scotland.
A charity, Kidney Research UK, said treatment options for kidney cancer were limited and the newly-approved drug would offer patients "more hope and more time with their loved ones".
Sallyann Allenby, 61, from Surrey is being treated for renal cell carcinoma - the most common type of kidney cancer - at Guy's Hospital in London.
She had a kidney removed in 2013 after finding blood in her urine on holiday and then collapsing on the flight home.
Sallyann has tried several different treatments, one of which gave her unpleasant side-effects, and she has also participated in a clinical trial which did not work for her.
In July, she began another new treatment and said cabozantinib gave her another option.
"This is really another hope for people like me, it's something else to look forward to...
"It's bad enough having the cancer, but if you know there's something else you can try then that keeps you going.
"I've got two lovely granddaughters. I want to be around for a while yet."
In trials, the drug was shown to be useful in patients whose kidney cancer had spread around the body and had become resistant to other treatments.
The way cabozantinib works means it can target molecules on drug-resistant cancer cells, stopping the tumours or at least silencing them for a while.
It works very differently to chemotherapy drugs and also immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab, which is approved to treat advanced kidney cancer on the NHS.
Nivolumab harnesses the power of the patient's own immune system to destroy their cancer cells.
Symptoms of kidney cancer can include blood in the urine, persistent pain in the side of the body just below the ribs and a lump or swelling in the kidney area.
The cancer usually affects adults in their 60s or 70s and is rare in people under 50.
If it's caught early, kidney cancer can often be cured but a delay in diagnosis means a cure is less likely.
A spokesman from Kidney Research UK said: "We are pleased to see cabozantinib has been approved by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, offering patients with renal cell carcinoma an increased chance of improved progression-free survival, compared to the standard therapy."

article Siller, who played Reverend Esther Warren in the ITV soap Coronation Street, had been diagnosed five years ago and died in hospital last Friday.
She is also known for her portrayal of Leona in BBC drama Casualty and her role of Marilyn Dingle in Emmerdale.
A statement from AHA Talent Agency described her as a "brilliant, moving and funny actor".
Antony Cotton, who plays Sean Tully in Coronation Street, said: "Morag Siller. What a woman. She was a magnificent human being. Devastated."
"I feel very lucky to have met her but I am devastated that she has passed away, she was such an amazing, generous, kind woman and a fantastic actress - just a beautiful human being," said Sally Dynevor, who plays Sally Metcalfe in the soap.
As well as her TV acting Siller also appeared on stage, most recently as Voltemand in Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015 and as Puttana in 'Tis Pity She's A Whore at the Globe, and she had performed parts in Les Miserables and Mamma Mia.
AHA Talent Agency said: "Morag will also be remembered for her extraordinary warmth, generosity and mischievous sense of humour as well as the fearless determination she displayed as she fought cancer whilst simultaneously raising tens of thousands of pounds for local charities.
"She was a truly inspirational person who we are incredibly proud to have represented. We will miss her hugely."
Actor Lee Boardman, who appeared in Coronation Street, tweeted: "So sad to hear of the passing of the wonderful Morag Siller. She played my girlfriend in Ladies of Letters & was a delight. God bless you M."

article The hosts were 2-0 up after just 17 minutes thanks to goals from Julien de Sart and Darren Bent.
Kadeem Harris scored either side of half-time to bring the visitors level, and Craig Noone put them ahead with a fine curling effort.
Bent's header made it 3-3 but Ralls' injury-time penalty won it for Cardiff.
Victory lifts Neil Warnock's side up to 12th in the Championship table, just one place and five points behind Derby, who fall to 11th and are now eight points adrift of the top six.
Steve McClaren's men had recovered from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at home to Bristol City on Saturday, but on this occasion it was the Rams who were on the receiving end of a dramatic turnaround.
Derby looked in total control when De Sart struck on the rebound and Bent converted from Tom Ince's pass to put the home side 2-0 up.
But four minutes before the interval, Harris gave Cardiff hope when his deflected strike looped over Scott Carson in the home goal.
Harris then scored less than two minutes after the restart as he pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.
Cardiff led for the first time when Noone skilfully found the top corner from the edge of the box, but Bent appeared to have salvaged a point for Derby when he rose higher than Sean Morrison to head in.
However, there was a final twist in added time as Bluebirds substitute Rhys Healey was tripped by Alex Pearce, allowing Ralls to calmly stroke his penalty into the bottom corner.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:
"You score three goals at home and you expect to win but we haven't done that in the last two games. Why? Because we conceded seven goals.
"We've gone from a team who were hard to beat and defended very, very well to conceding seven in two games and you don't collect points doing that.
"This is the first defeat at home since September so let's not panic and over-react and say the wheels have come off, but we have to work hard on the training field."
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock:
"That's what you call old-fashioned football, end-to-end stuff and that's why I love the game. It was great to be involved in one like that, especially coming out on the right side.
"It gives me a lot of pride when I see us come to a place like this and stand up and be counted, and that's why I love the Championship more than any other league because you get genuine lads in this level.
"The goal before half-time helped us enormously. We talked about not thinking about drawing the game but trying to win it. I think we can go anywhere and give people a good game now. The biggest problem we've got is ourselves."

article The authority said demand is falling and that the properties in question are not up to modern standards.
Of the homes to close, three are in Carlisle, with two in Whitehaven and one each in Cleator Moor, Egremont, Ulverston and Walney Island.
Campaigners opposed to the plan said bed numbers will halve and put pressure on families and the NHS.
The decision to close the homes was taken at a Cumbria County Council cabinet meeting in Carlisle earlier and follows a public consultation.
The authority said two new properties in Carlisle and Copeland, the plans of which were approved in February 2016, will be sufficient to cope with demand.
They are expected to open in 2018.
Councillor Beth Furneaux said: "We can't do nothing. The homes we've got are not full, many are running close to half full.
"Most of the places we are closing, the environment isn't suitable for providing high levels of dementia care."
Seven campaigners from the Socialist Party held a protest outside the council's headquarters ahead of the vote.
One of them, Brent Kennedy, said: "We need more beds, not fewer.
"They're going to get rid of 137 beds. That's going to cause problems for elderly people, their carers and families. It's also going to cause problems for the NHS."

article Ministers wanted employees to organise the payment of union dues themselves by other means such as direct debit.
But unions argued that this would be more complicated for members and so lead to a loss of funds.
Lord Bridges of Headley announced a "pause" in the plans, saying there were "cannons" attacking them on all sides.
He told peers the government would change the Trade Union Bill to remove the end to "check-off" at its next stage in the House of Lords, saying the move had never been intended to undermine the union movement.
"Arguments have been made with considerable vim and vigour that by ending check-off and moving to direct debit, those on low pay and especially those who have pay day loans might have to cease being trade union members or have to pay extra bank charges," he said.
"Again, this is not our intention and never has been."
The payment of subscriptions by deduction from wages can now continue - providing the union bears the administrative cost.
The Conservative peer who led the parliamentary campaign against the move, Lord Balfe, said he was "delighted" to be able to tear up the speech he had been about to make opposing the government.
"I think it was clear to anyone who looked at the detail that the government's proposals on check-off stood to do considerable damage both to the unions themselves and to their members and potential members," he said.
"I was particularly concerned about the impact on low paid, mostly female workers, who stood to lose out on the protection and benefits of trade union membership."
The TUC welcomed the U-turn, thanking all of those who had lobbied the government over the issue.
"Banning workers from choosing to pay union subs in a convenient way through their payroll would, as many have warned, damaged industrial relations and morale in key services," said its general secretary Frances O'Grady.
"While this is an important milestone, the TUC remains opposed to the Trade Union Bill in its entirety and will continue to push for further changes when it is debated again in the House of Commons next week."
Ministers are standing by other key aspects of the bill, such as the introduction of electronic balloting and restrictions on political funds used by unions for campaigning, despite a series of defeats in the Lords.
summary The government has rejected plans to introduce a new system for paying union dues.

article James Comey spoke to US politicians as the war of words between the FBI and Apple intensified.
The FBI has asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook who killed 14 people in December 2015.
Apple has refused, saying the protection of personal data was "incredibly important".
"This is the hardest question I have seen in government and it's going to require negotiation and conversation," Mr Comey told the House Intelligence Committee.
"I love encryption, I love privacy, and when I hear corporations saying we're going to take you to a world where no one can look at your stuff, part of me thinks that's great," he said.
However, he added, law enforcement saved lives, rescued children and prevented terror attacks using search warrants that gave it access to information on mobile phones.
"We are going to move to a world where that is not possible anymore," he said. "The world will not end but it will be a different world than where we are today and where we were in 2014."
People needed to understand "the costs associated with moving to a world of universal strong encryption", he added.
Mr Comey said it should be left to Congress and others to decide about what counted as reasonable law enforcement access to encrypted data.
He also said if Apple did unlock the phone it was "unlikely to be a trailblazer" for many future cases. The speed with which the technology in smartphones changes meant any defects Apple exploited to get at data would not be present in newer gadgets. Despite this, he added that it would be "instructive" for other courts.
At another hearing Microsoft President Brad Smith said it would be filing an amicus brief to support Apple's position.
Mr Smith told a House Judiciary Committee that Microsoft "wholeheartedly" supported Apple on the issue of resisting calls to unlock the phone.
Earlier this week Microsoft founder Bill Gates said the row should prompt a debate about the access that law enforcement gets to data in terror investigations.
The row between Apple and the FBI over the phone of Farook blew up last week when the bureau asked the electronics firm for help to unlock the smartphone. Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and wounded 22 others during the attack in San Bernadino.
So far, Apple has refused to unlock the phone. In an interview aired yesterday with US TV network ABC, Apple boss Tim Cook said the FBI was asking it to make "the software equivalent of cancer".
He added: "Some things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things."
Apple has until 26 February to formally respond to the FBI order.

"Lisa's family have endured 10 years of pain and unanswered questions following her disappearance and they deserve to know what happened to her," Peter Stafford, Crimestoppers committee chairman for Northern Ireland, said.
"We take your information completely anonymously, never ask for any of your details, and significantly, you'll never have to give a statement to police or go to court.
"So please, do the right thing and tell us what you know and help bring some peace to this family."
The new reward is in addition to one of £10,000 previously put up by the family.

Families of those who died will be consulted about what form the inquiry should take.
It could be a public Hillsborough-style inquiry or a judge-led statutory inquiry, the prime minister has said.
Mr Carberry, who is one of about 6,000 people across the UK to have been infected with hepatitis C, said he was "relieved" that a public inquiry will be launched.
"I want to see the truth, accountability. This is with the government and Department of Health - they need to answer for it," he added.
"The victims need to be involved right in the centre of it.
"They're the ones with the evidence and they are the ones who need the answers.
"The bureaucrats can't do it, and the Department of Health can't look at itself so it needs to be an independent inquiry."
The scandal has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS.

article The telecoms equipment maker's growth was driven by the global adoption of fourth-generation (4G) mobile technology.
Its revenue also increased by about 20% in the same period, the company said.
The Chinese conglomerate competes with the likes of Sweden's Ericsson for technology infrastructure such as mobile phone masts.
It is also in the race with other tech giants to develop 5G technology, while also being a player in the smartphone market.
Huawei's consumer business saw revenue rise by about 32% from a year ago thanks to the higher sales of its mid- to high-end range of mobile phones, it said in a statement.
The firm's growth comes despite it facing challenges in several major economies. In the US it was scrutinised for posing a security risk because of its alleged close ties with the Chinese government.
It has been banned from being involved in broadband projects in the US and Australia over espionage fears.

article Many forces were not "seeking out intelligence on corruption proactively", Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary found.
But it said there was no evidence of "endemic" corruption.
And it added that most officers and staff were "honest and professional".
In the report, entitled Integrity Matters, HMIC said systems for handling corruption "varied considerably" between forces, and that too few forces were able to identify and analyse the threats and take proactive steps to catch corrupt officers.
The inspectors also raised concerns that anti-corruption investigators were not using their full powers - such as carrying out searches and drug tests - and as a result were missing opportunities to gather evidence.
The report also suggested it was "impossible" to know the extent of corruption as there was no agreed definition of the term.
To identify corruption, the report therefore complied data on behaviours "most likely" to involve corruption: drug-related offences, bribery, theft, sexual misconduct and unauthorised information disclosure.
HMIC raised concerns about the fact that fewer than a third of the 3,070 investigations into allegations in these categories in the 12 months up to March 2014 resulted in "management action", written warnings, dismissals or resignations.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Mike Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that one reason for cases being dropped was that they were discovered to be "unfounded or malicious".
But he added: "We cannot rule out that some of those allegations have not been properly inquired into or investigated."
By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent
The more you look for it, the more you'll find it - that's the key message on police corruption from this 226-page report.
And some forces aren't looking hard enough - they're failing to identify the threats, develop intelligence and use their full powers to root out corrupt officers.
As the report says, it may partly be down to a lack of resources and specialist capability: this is difficult work, which sometimes involves using the most sophisticated covert techniques against colleagues.
But is it also because some officers lack the motivation to investigate their own?
The report doesn't answer that.
But it does suggest that ethical standards remain high - so high in fact that some beat officers refuse to accept cups of tea from members of the public in case their acceptance of hospitality is misinterpreted.
The report, rightly, says that's going too far.
Mr Cunningham said police forces had made "great strides" in tackling misconduct and corruption, and they must now "focus on proactive prevention work".
He said senior officers were demonstrating "commitment" to stopping corruption, and officers were "quick to tell us that they see corrupt colleagues as a betrayal of the vast majority who are honourable, decent and hard-working".
He added: "We know only too well that the corrosive nature of corruption means that even a single case can be damaging to public confidence."
The Inspectorate also said that, while more than three quarters of the 17,200 officers surveyed felt they were encouraged to challenge unethical behaviour, only "just over half" said they trusted the confidentiality of internal reporting systems.
The report, commissioned by Home Secretary Theresa May, found the majority of forces had "maintained or increased staffing levels" in anti-corruption units despite budget cuts.
The College of Policing said its code of ethics was being adopted by all forces and it was exploring how counter-corruption training could be expanded.
The college's chief executive, Chief Constable Alex Marshall, added: "Work has already begun to provide guidance to forces for best practice in managing whistleblowing.
"This should increase confidence among officers that their force will know how to deal with any disclosure appropriately."

article Before Olympic champion Dame Mary Peters turned off the last of the UK's analogue TV signals in Belfast, a series of graphics on Ceefax's front page disappeared down to a small dot.
The Plain English Campaign earlier gave Ceefax a lifetime achievement award for "clarity" and use of "everyday words".
And ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major said Ceefax would be "much missed".
Sir John, who has previously revealed that he regularly checked Ceefax pages between Downing Street meetings to keep up to date with cricket scores, said: "Ceefax will be much missed. At moments of high pressure - with little time for detailed examination of the news - Ceefax headlines offered an instant window on the world.
"From breaking global news to domestic sports news, Ceefax was speedy, accurate and indispensable. It can be proud of its record."
A few weeks after Ceefax provided coverage of its 10th and final Olympic Games, Lord Coe added his own tribute by saying: "Ceefax has been an invaluable news service for every sports fan over the last 38 years.
"I have checked in on many a sports news story, track and field triumph and, of course, Chelsea results!"
Ceefax was launched on 23 September 1974 to give BBC viewers the chance to check the latest news headlines, sports scores, weather forecast or TV listings - in a pre-internet era where the only alternative was to wait for the next TV or radio bulletin to be aired.
Its premise was to give viewers free access to the same information that was coming into the BBC newsroom, as soon as the BBC's journalists had received it.
Ceefax had initially been developed when BBC engineers, exploring ways to provide subtitles to enable viewers with hearing problems to enjoy BBC TV programmes, found it was possible to transmit full pages of text information in the "spare lines" transmitted on the analogue TV signal.
10 things you didn't know about Ceefax
The BBC then appointed veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, its former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer, as the first editor of a news and information service which was broadcast using the same method.
It was called Ceefax, simply because viewers would be able to quickly "see the facts" of any story of the day.
McIntyre initially updated 24 news pages on his own, feeding punch tape into machines, before recruiting Ceefax's first eight journalists.
Initially the service was a minority interest, with just a handful of Ceefax-capable TVs in the UK, but it slowly started to gain popularity and the engineering team that developed the service was honoured with a Queen's Award for innovation.
But the real impetus for viewers came when BBC Television decided to use a selection of Ceefax pages, accompanied by music, before the start of programming each day. Initially called Ceefax AM and Ceefax In Vision, the Pages From Ceefax "programme" continued for 30 years, being broadcast overnight on BBC Two until this week.
As viewers got a small taste of what Ceefax had to offer, millions of Britons during the 1980s invested in new teletext-enabled TV sets which gave them access to the full Ceefax service, which by now included recipe details for dishes prepared on BBC cookery shows, share prices, music reviews and an annual advent calendar.
Its audience peaked in the 1990s when it had 20 million viewers who checked the service at least once a week. Since the launch of the National Lottery in 1994, dozens of jackpot winners have revealed that they first learned their life had been changed when they checked their numbers on Ceefax.
But the launch of the UK's TV digital signal, and the announcement that the analogue TV signal would disappear in a staged switch-off over five years, meant a slow withdrawal of Ceefax, ending with the final broadcast in Northern Ireland.
BBC Northern Ireland and UTV screened a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV, and then Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - pressed the button to change the television landscape.
The hour-long special programme, The Magic Box, was hosted by Eamonn Holmes.
The show was billed as a nostalgic celebration of "the best of Northern Ireland television over the past 60 years".
Speaking as he closed the simulcast programme, Mr Holmes thanked viewers for watching and said: "Here's to the next 60 years."
By Mort  SmithOriginal Ceefax staff member
The early days of the service proved anything but hi-tech.
Ceefax journalists would monitor incoming wire copy and when a story was to be updated they would type at one of two production terminals and create a Ceefax page.
Then, they had to produce a punched tape - approximately a yard long - and take it down two flights of stairs to the Central Apparatus Room, load it into a tape reader and watch as it was read into an anonymous metal box called a core store which actually transmitted the pages.
A walk back up to the sixth floor followed and if, at that point, it was discovered that a spelling mistake had been made, the journalist had to go through the whole process again.
It ensured close attention to detail when writing!
Read Mort's memories in full
Dame Mary described the role of switching off the last analogue transmitter, at Divis Mountain in Belfast, as "a great privilege".
Viewers who checked Ceefax during the evening saw a special graphics countdown on page 100.
And weather presenters on the BBC during the day paid their own tribute by incorporating Ceefax's Lego block-style maps into their forecasts.
Ceefax's commitment to getting information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible has been marked by the lifetime achievement award from the Plain English Campaign, the pressure group that calls for the use of concise and clear language in all public communication.
Founder Chrissie Maher said:  "Ceefax helped everyday people with everyday words and I will be giving it a Chrissie Maher Award for its 30 years of commitment to using plain English. It was my first port of call."
She added: "It helped the public keep in touch with world affairs and everyday information with its crystal-clear communications. I will miss its clarity."
Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said in response: "Throughout its distinguished years of service to audiences, Ceefax has always aimed to provide news which is clear, concise and simply expressed.
"It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story."
Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: "Ceefax revolutionised the way in which the public accessed information. Its peak audience of 20 million viewers is testament to the regard in which it was held - its cessation a reminder of how quickly technology is now progressing."
Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, said: "Ceefax is a great national institution, and it's sad to bid goodbye to a service which gave so many access to news, sport, TV listings and much else besides.
"But with the end of one era comes the start of another as the digital switchover is completed - people can access more channels, and interactive services which are the successors of Ceefax."

article David Robertson, former master distiller for The Macallan, plans to open the Holyrood Park Distillery.
If plans are approved, the Â£2m distillery will be housed in the Engine Shed building and will be open to visitors.
Glen Sciennes was the last single malt whisky distillery to operate in Edinburgh before its closure in 1925.
Edinburgh councillors have agreed to lease the Engine Shed building to the company.
The proposals are now subject to planning approval.
Mr Robertson said: "We are very excited by the prospect of resurrecting the proud tradition of distilling single malt whisky in Edinburgh.
"We hope to be able to create an immersive and entertaining visitor experience, supporting the local economy through jobs and training opportunities while reinforcing the capital's position as a world-class tourism destination.
"Most importantly, our goal is to create beautiful, hand-crafted single malt whiskies which will stand shoulder to shoulder with the other great single malts that are now being produced in Scotland and elsewhere."
The business aims to start distilling whisky by next summer and release a single malt whisky within four years.
It would initially employ up to 25 staff at varying levels, from trainees up to experienced distillery operators, tourism and production managers.
Former railway building the Engine Shed operated until recently as a cafe and bakery employing adults with learning difficulties.

article The leaders of Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan signed the agreement in Sudan's capital, Khartoum.
Egypt has opposed the Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, saying it would worsen its water shortages.
Ethiopia says the dam will give it a fairer share of Nile waters.
In 2013, Ethiopia's parliament ratified a controversial treaty to replace colonial-era agreements that gave Egypt and Sudan the biggest share of the Nile's water.
Egypt's then-President Mohamed Morsi said he did not want war but he would not allow Egypt's water supply to be endangered by the dam.
Mr Morsi's successor, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi signed the deal with Ethiopia's Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn and Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.
The three leaders welcomed the "declaration of principles" agreement in speeches in Khartoum's Republican Palace, and watched a short film about the Grand Renaissance Dam that highlighted how it could benefit the region, the Associated Press news agency reports.
Mr Halemariam said he wanted to give an assurance that the dam would "not cause any harm to downstream countries", Reuters news agency reports.
Mr Sisi said the project remained a source of concern to Egypt.
"The Renaissance Dam project represents a source of development for the millions of Ethiopia's citizens through producing green and sustainable energy, but for their brothers living on the banks of that very Nile in Egypt, and who approximately equal them in numbers, it represents a source of concern and worry," he said.
"This is because the Nile is their only source of water, in fact their source of life."
Ethiopia wants to replace a 1929 treaty written by Britain that awarded Egypt veto power over any project involving the Nile by upstream countries.
Ethiopia says the $4.7bn (Â£3.1bn) dam will eventually provide 6,000 megawatts of power.
Egypt was apparently caught by surprise when Ethiopia started diverting the Blue Nile - a tributary of the Nile - in 2013.
Ethiopia says the river will be slightly diverted but will then be able to follow its natural course.
Egyptian politicians were inadvertently heard on live TV in 2013, proposing military action over the dam.
Ethiopia has received strong backing from five other Nile-basin countries - Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Burundi.

article Mr Brown said Labour must not become "a party of permanent protest".
He said he was not attacking a leadership candidate, but some comments appeared to warn against Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Corbyn's team said he was most likely to engage non-Labour voters.
The other candidates are Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham.
Mr Brown's comments come as a poll suggested Mr Corbyn is considered the candidate most likely to worsen Labour's prospects of winning the next election.
Polls also suggest Mr Corbyn is the front-runner in the leadership race.
Mr Brown did not use Mr Corbyn's name but made it clear he disagreed with many of his economic and social policies.
He said the UK must continue to build international alliances under a future Labour government.
He added: "I have to say that if our global alliances are going to be alliances with Hezbollah and Hamas and Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Vladimir Putin's Russia, there is absolutely no chance of building a world-wide alliance that can deal with poverty and inequality and climate change and financial instability, and we've got to face up to that fact."
Mr Corbyn has previously described Hezbollah as "friends" and said that he wanted Hamas to be "part of the debate".
Analysis: Alex Forsyth, political correspondent, BBC News
Gordon Brown didn't need to mention Jeremy Corbyn's name for his message to be understood; if he wins the leadership race Labour risks electoral oblivion.
The warning was couched in more subtle terms than those used previously by people who've called Mr Corbyn a potential car crash, but it was no less potent.
Steeped in references to Labour's past, this was a speech designed to tug heart strings from a man who commands the attention of some on Labour's left.
The question will be whether it makes any difference.
Many of Mr Corbyn's supporters say he provides an alternative to the current political system - so they may not be swayed by the views of established politicians.
Mr Brown also referred repeatedly to the need for Labour to become more than a party of protest - while also warning it needed to be different from the Tories.
"What I am here to say is that the best way of realising our high ideals is to show that we have an alternative in government that is credible, that is radical, and is electable - is neither a pale imitation of what the Tories offer nor is it the route to being a party of permanent protest, rather than a party of government," he said.
BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said part of the speech was as much a "coded dig" at Ms Kendall as it was at Mr Corbyn.
Mr Brown went on: "It is not a mistake to want power. It is not a mistake to do what is necessary to get back to power."
The former MP also said the party had to offer "hope" to the public that it could be an alternative government.
"I believe that our vote is both a public duty and a sacred trust.
"It is a public duty because we have got to show that the Labour Party can be at the service of the country and that we can change society for the better in the future," he said.
Last week, Mr Brown's predecessor at Number 10, Tony Blair, warned that Labour risked annihilation if it elected Mr Corbyn.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was the candidate "most likely to engage with voters beyond Labour's existing supporters" and credibility did not mean signing up to austerity.
Ms Cooper said it was "no good just being angry at the world if you can't change the world".
Mr Burnham said the country "needs a strong opposition" and Mr Brown and others "need to be listened to".
Earlier, Ms Kendall insisted she had no intention of stepping aside in the race, with polls suggesting she is lagging behind other candidates.
Mr Brown spoke after a ComRes study of 2,035 adults in Britain, for the Independent on Sunday and Sunday Mirror, found 31% of those polled thought Mr Corbyn would worsen Labour's prospects of electoral success. Mr Burnham was the poll's least damaging candidate.
Conversely though, 21% thought Mr Corbyn would be most likely to boost Labour's chances of winning the next election.

article After James Brophy forced an early save from Angus Gunn, Oliver Lancashire headed home a free-kick to put the visitors in front at Carrow Road.
But Cameron Jerome quickly levelled and Wes Hoolahan played a one-two with James Maddison before making it two.
Maddison soon added the third and, although Paul Mullin pulled one back after the break, it was not enough.
Norwich made three changes to the side that drew at Fulham on Saturday, with Hoolahan, Ivo Pinto and Josh Murphy coming in to the side, but it was Maddison who was at the heart of most of their attacking play in the opening half, as well as clearing off the line from Harry Smith.
Swindon, though, refused to give up despite the two-goal interval deficit and, after Mullin headed in from a Chris Hussey set-piece, Gunn had to make an excellent save to deny him a second and keep out late efforts by Ellis Iandolo and James Dunne to prevent Town taking the tie to extra-time.

article Mr Xi's comments came at an annual China-US dialogue held in Beijing.
Diplomats are expected to discuss China's currency, North Korea and tensions in the South China Sea.
The US delegation is led by Secretary of State John Kerry, who in his opening remarks said that the US was not seeking to "contain" China.
Mr Xi said the two countries' interests were now "more than ever interconnected", with much to gain from co-operation.
"China-US confrontation, to the two countries and the world, would definitely be a disaster," he said.
"We should mutually respect and treat each other equally, and respect the other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect each other's choice on the path of development."
Mr Kerry, meanwhile, said the US did "not seek to contain China" and urged Beijing not to "interpret it as an overall strategy" when the US differed from China on certain issues.
US President Barack Obama also said in a statement that the US "welcomes the emergence of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous China".
"We remain determined to ensure that co-operation defines the overall relationship," he said.
But US leaders have also called on China to do its part in maintaining stability in Asia.
Mr Kerry said the US welcomed a China that "contributes to the stability and development of the region and chooses to play a responsible role in world affairs".
The talks come with China locked in bitter disputes with several neighbours in the region, notably Vietnam and the Philippines, over claims in the South China Sea.
In turn, the US has stepped up joint military exercises with the Philippines and its military presence there, a move over which China has raised concerns. One of the latest exercises was conducted in the South China Sea near disputed waters two weeks ago.
Increased anti-Japan rhetoric has also come from China in recent weeks, following a decision by the Japanese cabinet to reinterpret the constitution, giving the Japanese military greater latitude to fight overseas.
Both countries claim a string of islands in the East China Sea and ties are severely strained over this issue.
The US and China have also had disagreements in recent months, particularly over cyber-attacks.
In May, US authorities charged five Chinese military officers with hacking into American businesses. Beijing has vigorously denied the charges, accusing the US of launching cyber-attacks against China.

article Official figures showed 23,994 support staff were employed by schools across Wales in 2016 but that was 446 fewer compared to 12 months earlier.
The number of teachers is also down by 275 to 23,235.
But the Welsh Government said the pupil-teacher ratio has remained "relatively" stable.
"After years of cuts, head teachers have little wriggle room but to look at the staffing they have," Owen Hathway, the National Union of Teachers policy officer in Wales told Welsh language news programme Newyddion 9.
"This needs to be avoided because any teacher or classroom assistant that is lost puts more pressure on that staff who are still there.
"That isn't fair on the children when we're trying to ensure they get the best education in Wales."
Jess Turner, from Unison which represents ancillary staff in schools, said schools needed more than just teachers to run properly.
She added: "Every time a caretaker, cleaner or admin worker loses their job it means more pressure on classroom staff.
"Those who remain do their best to keep up standards in their schools but with fewer staff, safety and security is bound to be compromised."
Tegwen Ellis, head teacher at Ysgol Cynwyd Sant in Maesteg, said accessing more money was essential in order to reduce pressure.
Her school's budget is Â£70,000 less in this academic year - a situation not uncommon across Wales - but they have managed to bridge that gap by securing further grants from elsewhere.
"Some schools get sponsorship from businesses, some schools are working alongside businesses to develop children in a different way, and we as a school have to think in a different way as well," she said.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are well aware of the financial challenges facing our schools and have prioritised funding for schools within the settlement we provide for local government in Wales.
"Over the past five years to 2016, there has been a reduction in teacher numbers but the pupil-teacher ratio has remained relatively stable (18.4 to 18.6)."
The spokesman added there were 1,700 more support staff than five years ago.

article He said the Lib Dems had too often tried to emulate the Conservatives and Labour, warning that Westminster was a "beguiling place".
Mr Farron urged activists to focus on community politics to find their "path back to power", in a speech in York.
The party was reduced from 57 to eight MPs at the 2015 general election.
Its election defeat triggered the resignation of then-leader Nick Clegg, and the party lost its status as the third largest party in Parliament - a mantle now held by the SNP.
Speaking on the final day of the Lib Dem spring conference, Mr Farron told members he was "dead proud" that the Lib Dems "put country before party" by entering into government with the Conservatives in 2010.
"But were the seeds of our setback in May sown many years before? Because Westminster can be a beguiling place," he said.
"When you are there, there's constant temptation to try and be like everyone else," he said.
"We arrive in the big league on our terms. But we too often attempt to remain on theirs," he warned, and appealed to his party: "We must return to our roots.
"No matter the office, always remaining true to our instincts.
"It's time to focus not on parliamentary games, but on real life. It's time we got back to community politics."
Mr Farron also used his speech to call for tax reform ahead of Wednesday's Budget, accusing the government of "fawning" over big business at the expense of small businesses.
"Google and Facebook can negotiate with the tax office for months, yet small businesses can't even get through on the phone," he said.
And he suggested: "Instead of government fawning over the multinationals how about putting small business at the centre of our business economy."
Mr Farron announced that he had appointed former Lib Dem business secretary Vince Cable would lead an expert panel looking at ways to "radically reform" business taxation.
On Sunday's Andrew Marr Show, Chancellor George Osborne defended the controversial Â£130m tax deal Google reached with HMRC, branded as "derisory" by critics.

article The German publication claims to have seen secret documents from the National Security Agency which show Mrs Merkel's number on a list dating from 2002 - before she became chancellor.
Another report says Mr Obama was told in 2010 about the surveillance.
Meanwhile Washington has seen a protest against the NSA's spying programme.
Several thousand protesters marched to the US Capitol to demand a limit to the surveillance. Some of them held banners in support of the fugitive former contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed the extent of the NSA's activities.
The nature of the monitoring of Mrs Merkel's mobile phone is not clear from the files, Der Spiegel says.
For example, it is possible that the chancellor's conversations were recorded, or that her contacts were simply assessed.
Germany is sending its top intelligence chiefs to Washington in the coming week to "push forward" an investigation into the spying allegations, which have caused outrage in Germany.
Mrs Merkel phoned the US president when she first heard of the spying allegations on Wednesday.
President Barack Obama apologised to the German chancellor and promised Mrs Merkel he knew nothing of the alleged phone monitoring and would have stopped it if he had, Der Spiegel reports.
But on Sunday Bild newspaper quoted US intelligence sources as saying NSA head Keith Alexander personally briefed the president about the covert operation targeting Mrs Merkel in 2010.
"Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue," the newspaper quoted a senior NSA official as saying.
Her number was still on a surveillance list in 2013.
On Friday, Germany and France said they wanted the US to sign a no-spy deal by the end of the year.
As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls made by German and French citizens.
By Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin
This scandal has caused one of the biggest diplomatic rifts between Germany and the US in recent years.
A close ally of Mrs Merkel told the BBC that she was personally very hurt by the idea of being spied on by American friends.
The chancellor is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying that she had to deal with while growing up in Communist East Germany.
The documents seen by Der Spiegel give further details of the NSA's targeting of European governments.
A unit called Special Collection Services, based on the fourth floor of the US embassy in Pariser Platz in Berlin, was responsible for monitoring communications in the German capital's government quarter, including those targeting Mrs Merkel.
Germany's Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Bild that running such an operation on German soil would be illegal under German law, and adds that those "responsible must be held accountable".
A criminal investigation would take the current scandal out of the hands of diplomats and politicians, and so make it harder to control politically, says the BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin.
Similar listening units were based in around 80 locations worldwide, according to the documents seen by Der Spiegel, 19 of them in European cities.
If the existence of listening stations in US embassies were known, there would be "severe damage for the US's relations with a foreign government," the documents said.
The US government had a second German spy base in Frankfurt am Main, the magazine reports.
The scandal has caused the biggest diplomatic rift between Germany and the US in living memory, reports the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin.
Mrs Merkel - an Americophile who was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011 - is said to be shocked that Washington may have engaged in the sort of spying she had to endure growing up in Communist East Germany.

article The aviary acts like a seed bank for poultry, storing primordial stem cells that produce eggs destined to hatch male or female offspring.
The Edinburgh University team  have collected more than 500 samples from 25 different breeds.
The cells are held in a freezer at -150C and will be viable for decades.
The researchers at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute want to preserve rare poultry breeds that may be resistant to infections such as bird flu or have desirable traits such as high meat quality.
The first step was to create the GM hens capable of laying eggs from multiple different rare breeds, which include the colourfully-named "rumpless game", "Scots dumpy", "Sicilian buttercup", and "Old English pheasant fowl".
This was done using gene editing technology to target part of a gene called DDX4 which is vital for bird fertility.
The scientists knocked out the gene to create an egg containing a sterile chick.
However, after one of the stem cells was implanted into that egg it instead hatched into a GM surrogate which could go on to produce eggs and chicks from the chosen rare breed.
Lead scientist Dr Mike McGrew said: "These chickens are a first step in saving and protecting rare poultry breeds from loss in order to preserve future biodiversity of our poultry from both economic and climate stresses."
He spoke about the project to journalists at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston, Massachusetts.
Dr McGrew said there were strong parallels with seed banks aimed at preserving rare and endangered plant species.
He added: "We call it the frozen aviary because we want to freeze down these stem cells from a lot of different breeds of poultry, starting with chickens.
"Then we'd like to freeze down other breeds of poultry like geese; quail also.
"Our success so far is just with chickens but our plans are to do this with other bird species."
To what extent it might be possible to use chickens as surrogate mothers for different bird species - not merely breeds - remains an unanswered question.
Dr McGrew said: "No-one knows if you transplanted these cells between different bird species if they would be able to make an egg from a different bird species.
"I have my doubts that it would work."
While the chances of a chicken laying an eagle egg were remote, he thought the process could suit closely-related species such as different varieties of duck or goose.
Rare chickens come in a wide variety of different shapes, sizes and colours, and a number have some very unusual features.
One, the Dong Tao chicken, has oversized stumpy legs considered to be a delicacy in its native Vietnam.
Richard Broad, from the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, said: "The idea behind it really interests us.
"Basically you can just have a gene bank of rare breeds in the freezer. You can save all kinds of breeds, put them in a freezer and there would be a genetic ark for us.
"If you had one in every country, it would be a wonderful thing."

article Prime minister David Cameron has said he will take part in only one.
Mr Clegg accused the Conservatives of attempting to "dictate the terms" of the debates.
Broadcasters have said plans for three TV general election debates in April will go ahead.
"It is a little bit arrogant of the Conservatives to somehow assume that they can, you know, dictate terms - these aren't the debates run by the Conservative Party. They belong to the British people," Mr Clegg said.
He added: "If David Cameron is too important or too busy to turn up, if he doesn't want to defend the record of this coalition government, then I will."
Labour leader Ed Miliband on Saturday formally accepted invitations to appear in all three of the live TV debates on April 2, 16 and 30.
He told the Scottish Labour conference: "I say to David Cameron: You can refuse to face the public, but you can't deny your record. You can try to chicken out of the debates, but don't ever again claim that you provide strong leadership."
Downing Street has said it will not back down on its "final offer" of one seven-way debate in March.
It has blamed broadcasters for creating a "chaotic" situation during negotiations around the debates.
Sky, the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV have invited the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, UKIP, the SNP, the Green Party of England and Wales and Plaid Cymru to take part in two debates lasting two hours each during the election campaign.
As it stands, the broadcasters have said the debates will go ahead as originally planned, while a planned head-to-head encounter between the Conservative and Labour leaders will also continue on 30 April.
Mr Clegg's comments are similar to those previously made by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who said that David Cameron "simply cannot be allowed to dictate terms to everyone else taking part."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has also put forward a similar point of view when she said: "It would have been wrong for one individual to dictate and change the terms of these debates."
However, Peter Robinson, leader of the DUP and First Minister of Northern Ireland, said it was the broadcasters who were trying to "set down a diktat" with their plans.
Mr Miliband has previously accused Mr Cameron of "running scared" from TV debates, and "cowering from the public".
However, Mr Cameron has said he wants to "unblock the logjam" the "broadcasters helped to create" by appearing in one debate.
UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said UKIP will "accept the challenge" of the debates, but has criticised broadcasters for changing the original proposals and agreeing to let more parties take part.
The Greens have said the proposed format of the debates is "very fair" and that Mr Cameron's stance was damaging to the reputation of politics.

article The Boundary Commission for Wales will set out a new parliamentary map of Wales, a Wales with 29 rather than the current 40 MPs.
In the same week, MPs will conclude their debates on the Wales Bill, which is designed to simplify the devolution settlement.
Shadow Leader of the Commons (and Shadow Welsh Secretary) Paul Flynn linked the two events during his latest appearance in the House of Commons.  He suggested they would illustrate "the degraded system that our democracy is and the way it's heading into further distress".
He added: "The Welsh Bill won't guarantee in any way a compensatory increase in the number of members of the Welsh Assembly, although their work level has trebled.
"But in the future Wales will lose eleven of the 40 MPs, will lose the four MEPs that represent Wales and we've got this great turmoil in our democratic system when the disgrace of buying places in the House of Lords continues."
Mr Flynn, whose own work level has increased in recent months, didn't mention that the Wales Bill will actually give the assembly the power to increase the number of AMs, should it wish.
But he did criticise the boundary changes as likely to disenfranchise two million people (across England and Wales) and favour only the Conservatives.
Commons leader David Lidington told Mr Flynn: "I was sorry by the disparaging tone you adopted towards the Wales Bill because after all what this government's record in Wales has been about is delivering the increased devolution which the Welsh people, the Welsh Assembly and political parties, for the most part in Wales, have been saying that they wanted to see
"And I was...I suppose I wasn't shocked.....I was disheartened by the critical remarks he threw in about the approach of the parliamentary Boundary Commission and the framework within which they are operating."
It transpired that Mr Lidington had been flicking through Mr Flynn's memoirs, in which there is strong praise for the Chartists, who, said the Commons leader, favoured constituencies with equal numbers of electors in each constituency.
"I'd have thought he'd have been cheering us on and not criticising us for doing it."

article A US judge found Japanese bank Nomura made false statements when selling bonds to US agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007.
Of the seven deals, RBS underwrote four valued at a total of $2bn (Â£1.28bn)..
The ruling opens the door for US authorities to recover $450m.
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are US government backed agencies that buy mortgages from banks and sell them as bonds to investors on the open market.
The value of those bonds plummeted in the wake of the financial crisis.
District Judge Denise Cote ruled in favour of a suit brought by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) saying supporting documents offered by Nomura "did not correctly describe the mortgage loans".
"The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous," she added.
Judge Cote said the securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "were supported by loans for which the underwriting process had failed," with deals comprised of 45% to 59% "materially defective" mortgages.
Nomura's lawyers claimed any losses incurred by Fannie and Freddie were not the banks' fault and were due to overall market conditions.
But the judge said the banks "have not quantified the loss that they say is due to macroeconomic factors".
Nor did the banks deny that "there is a link between the securitization frenzy associated with those shoddy practices and the very macroeconomic factors that they say caused the losses to the certificates," she wrote.
The exact amount of damages to be awarded was unclear. Judge Cote ordered the FHFA to submit a proposed judgment with updated damages figures based on her ruling by Friday.
But she said the FHFA was entitled to $624.4m, minus more than $178m in payments already made since the lawsuit began in 2011.
The FHFA welcomed the ruling, despite the amount appearing to be significantly lower than the $1bn it had sought during the trial.
FHFA general counsel Alfred Pollard said: "It is clear the court found that the facts presented by FHFA were convincing."
Nomura said in a statement that it planned to appeal, saying it was "confident that it was consistently candid, transparent and professional in all of its dealings with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac".
RBS declined to comment.
The lawsuit is the only one to so far have gone as far as a trial out of the 18 lawsuits file by the US regulator filed in 2011 regarding $200bn worth of mortgage-bonds sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by numerous banks in the lead up to the financial crisis.
The FHFA has already reached settlements worth a total of $17.9bn with banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank.

article The suspect can be seen taking the 25-year-old woman across Tennant Street, Birmingham, on 19 October 2014, minutes before she was attacked.
The woman had shown "remarkable courage" by allowing the release of the footage, West Midlands Police said.
An image of a key witness, known as Kevin, has previously been released.
The witness, who is believed to be in his 20s, with dwarfism, left the Walkabout bar on Broad Street with the woman at 04:00 BST.
The pair walked towards Granville Street, where the suspect - described as a black man - spoke to Kevin and scooped the woman into his arms, leaving Kevin alone, police said.
A short time later a report was made to the police when a member of the public found the woman in a highly distressed state.
Det Con Danette Calvey said: "There will undoubtedly be people who will watch these images and wrongly judge the woman.
"It must be remembered that this woman has been attacked and that she has displayed remarkable courage by allowing us to release the footage.
"She hopes that these new images may jog someone's memory and that their call may make the difference to her attacker being caught or left to roam the streets."
Det Con Calvey said police were still looking for Kevin, who is believed to have short dark hair.
Asked about the gap between the attack and the CCTV being put out, the force said it did not take decisions to release "footage like this lightly" due to the distress it could cause victims.
But the force said with the woman's consent it had "deemed the time is now right" in the hope the CCTV would prompt new leads.

article The objects that have either come ashore or brought close to isles in stormy weather have included lost pieces of military hardware and massive containers and even a boat carrying an empty coffin.
In 2009, a Canadian author was reunited with a message in a bottle following its 2,000-mile, five month-long journey across the Atlantic.
Ross Traverse had expected the bottle to wash up somewhere along the coast from his home in Torbay, Newfoundland.
However, it was found by two RSPB Scotland workers during a beach clean on Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides.
Mr Traverse travelled by plane, train, ferry and small boat to reach the isle to collect his message and bottle.
Four years ago, a Scots fisherman set a new Guinness World Record after finding a message in a bottle 98 years after it was released.
Andrew Leaper's discovery east of Shetland beat the previous record for the longest time a bottle had been adrift at sea by more than five years.
The drift bottle - containing a postcard which promised a reward of six pence to the finder - was released in June 1914 by Captain CH Brown of the Glasgow School of Navigation.
It was in a batch of 1,890 scientific research bottles which were specially designed to sink to help map the currents of the seas around Scotland when they were returned. About 300 of them have been found.
"Today's shout had an air of transatlantic mystery," said the RNLI following an unusual discovery in July 2013.
Tobermory lifeboat crew found what appeared to be a US Coastguard-certified craft with bullet holes in it off Muck in the Small Isles.
The RNLI said the upturned 14ft aluminium dinghy appeared to have been in the water for some time.
Just days earlier, the same Isle of Mull-based crew also recovered a large red object that resembled targets towed out to sea and used by the military.
The west coast of Scotland is used as a training area during the twice yearly UK-led Nato exercise Joint Warrior, and the red target was thought to be connected to that exercise.
In October 2015, another military target drone was found washed up on at the beach at Baleshare on North Uist.
The coastguard said it was a Mirach 100/5. This type of drone is used by armed forces worldwide to train on weapons systems.
It was cordoned off before later being removed. The find came just days after the finish of a staging of Exercise Joint Warrior.
In 2007, a giant metal container appeared on a beach on the Western Isles.
It turned out that the 15m-long tank, similar to those used to ferment beer, was one of six lost overboard from a ship close to the south western approaches to the English Channel.
After being adrift at sea for three weeks, the container was found by a dog walker on Poll na Crann - known as Stinky Bay - on Benbecula.
The following year the crew of a yacht with an empty coffin strapped to the deck had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew after losing their way near the Western Isles.
RNLI volunteers from Barra were called out after the craft got lost on its passage from America to Norway.
The coffin was bound for a bar in Norway's capital, Oslo.

article Stephen Port, 41, is accused of four murders and seven rapes, which he denies.
The Old Bailey heard police found 83 home-made sex videos on Mr Port's mobile phone.
Prosecutors said six recordings show him engaged in sexual activity with the a man who appears to be unconscious.
Det Sgt Mick McInerney, who presented the evidence to the court, told jurors the same 24-year-old appears in all six videos, which were recorded between January and June last year.
Some of the videos featured other unidentified participants, the court heard.
Port, who watched intently from the dock, denies two sample counts of rape relating to two of the videos.
Mr Port, who worked as a chef, is on trial accused of murdering four young men by giving them fatal doses of date rape drug GHB over a 15-month period.
He is also accused of drugging and raping other young men he met through dating websites and lured to his one-bedroom flat in Barking, east London.
He denies 29 charges including four counts of murder, as well as drugging, rape and sexual assault.
The trial continues.

article It comes three-and-a-half years after industrial action led to a threat by Ineos to close the plant permanently.
A source at Ineos claimed on Friday that union officials at Grangemouth were "impossible to work with".
The union Unite accused the firm of being "reckless" over pay talks.
The union represents most staff at the Grangemouth chemicals plant.
Unite said members had unanimously rejected a pay offer from the company following a three-year pay freeze.
The union, which has been pressing for a 3.25% pay rise, said Ineos had offered a 2.8% increase for newer grades of staff and 1.4% - with a 1.4% lump sum - for staff with longer service.
The Ineos source told BBC Scotland that the company had also offered an additional bonus of up to 17%.
Unite described the move to end union agreements at Grangemouth as "an incredibly foolish attempt to undermine the democratic rights of workers" there.
Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said: "After three years without a pay rise there is bound to be difficult negotiations, but Unite's demand for a 3.25% rise is more than reasonable and our intention remains to achieve a negotiated agreement.
"We would encourage Ineos to think again and to row back from what is an unnecessary act of aggression towards their own workforce."
The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, added: "If Ineos doesn't change its mind, we will simply go through the normal legal procedures, and push for an independent ballot of workers."
The source at Ineos said that the company worked well with unions at plants around the world, but it was dealing with the same people who led the union side at Grangemouth during the industrial dispute in 2014.
He added: "Trust has broken down. We had hoped for a constructive relationship with the new Unite, but it is the old Unite."
Ineos announced during the 2014 dispute that it would close the facility, with the loss of 800 jobs, but later reversed its decision after workers agreed to a survival plan which included a three-year pay freeze.
Pay talks between Ineos and unions at the nearby refinery are not affected by the latest developments.

article West Brom defender Craig Dawson scored the only goal of a breathless game from the penalty spot after Tottenham full-back Adam Smith was fouled in the box.
England could have won more comfortably but have the upper hand going into the second leg in Krusevac on Tuesday.
The only negative was a hamstring problem picked up by Jack Rodwell.
This was a seventh consecutive home win in a competitive match for England, equalling a record dating back more than 27 years. There was plenty of encouragement for Pearce against a Serbia team that had gone unbeaten in qualifying.
The performance of Raheem Sterling, on his debut at this level, was eye-catching. The Liverpool winger, with feet as sensitive as pick-pockets' hands, produced a bewildering repertoire of feints and swerves, sudden stops and demoralising spurts, turning and tormenting the Serbia defence time and again.
Blackpool's Tom Ince was equally impressive, without being able to apply a finish. With those two in his ranks, Pearce's side bristled with menace as England's wingers swapped places, eluded markers and dismantled Serbia's defensive system during a breathless and at times brutal opening period.
German referee Deniz Aytekin had shown three yellow cards by the seventh minute, as Serbia attempted to keep England's flyers in their blocks.
The best of England's early opportunities fell to Ince. The Blackpool winger combined well with Danny Rose in the 12th minute, only for the ball to skid off his forehead and beyond the far post with the goal at his mercy. A heavy first touch saw a second chance get away from Ince before a fizzing left-foot shot flashed narrowly wide.
England pushed for the breakthrough but with two clever, probing attacking surges Serbia served to remind everyone inside Carrow Road of their attacking potential.
Luka Milunovic might have done better when Darko Lazovic picked him out with a delightful cross from the right after a quickly-taken throw in. But despite being unmarked, the Red Star Belgrade striker got his header all wrong from six yards, before Sasa Markovic scuffed a shot wide from the edge of the box moments later.
Lazovic thumped a left-foot volley narrowly over for Serbia but it was England who made the brighter start to the second half. Sterling might have won a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area with another of his devastating surges but the referee allowed an advantage, which ultimately came to nothing.
The German official did blow his whistle soon after, however, as Adam Smith reacted first to a scrambled clearance of his initial cross to win a penalty for England after a mistimed challenge by Milunovic. Dawson made no mistake from the spot, his fifth goal in eight matches for Pearce's side.
Zaha should have doubled England's lead within two minutes as Ince burst down the left flank and found the Crystal Palace winger, whose left-foot shot flashed wide with the goal at his mercy. Then Steven Caulker was denied with eight minutes remaining as Serbia goalkeeper Branimir Aleksic produced a stunning save to turn his header away.
England U21 boss Stuart Pearce said: "We have won the game and kept a clean sheet, although we could have won it by more had we been more clinical in front of goal. Over there we will have more of an opportunity to break on them and use the pace we have. I would hope we would also be more clinical in front of goal."

article The Gulf airline is already a member of the Oneworld alliance.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he was delighted Qatar had become a "long-term supportive shareholder".
The stake, worth about Â£1.15bn, gives Qatar closer links with a group that has two major European hubs and strong transatlantic networks.
Mr Walsh said his company would explore what "opportunities exist to work more closely together and further IAG's ambitions as the leading global airline group".
Akbar Al Baker, chief executive of Qatar, said: "IAG represents an excellent opportunity to further develop our westwards strategy."
Earlier this month he criticised European airlines, saying they they "cannot keep up" with the competition posed by Gulf rivals.
The two groups' route networks are largely complementary, with Qatar strong in southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, while Iberia flies to many destinations in South America.
Qatar said it could increase its holding, but would be limited by the 49% cap on non-EU ownership of European airlines.
Neither group said whether IAG had been aware of Qatar's stake-building and did not say who the shares had been bought from, or when.
Qatar has more than 130 aircraft and a further 340 on order. It is competing with other Gulf airlines including Emirates, based in Dubai, and Abu Dhabi's Etihad.
The Doha-based carrier had 22m passengers in the 2013-14 financial year, compared with 44.5m for its larger rival Emirates. IAG carried just over 77m passengers in 2014.
Qatar's move comes as IAG attempts to complete a takeover of Aer Lingus for about Â£1.3bn.
The company has said it planned to run the Irish airline as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations.
IAG was formed when BA and Iberia merged in 2011. It has about 430 aircraft and 60,000 employees.
Shares in IAG closed down 3.5% at 544.5p on Friday, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.
The stock has risen by more than a third in the past 12 months and the company is valued at Â£11.4bn.

article If you can't, you probably have that in common with roughly 99.999% recurring of the population.
Need a clue?
It includes the work of, among others, Delacroix, Ruskin, Sickert and Freud.
None the wiser? Maybe not. But better-informed.....
So here goes:
The Garman Ryan Collection comprises 365 paintings, drawings and sculptures donated to the people of Walsall in 1973 by Kathleen Garman, the widow of the sculptor Jacob Epstein, and his pupil Sally Garman, who had grown up in the Black Country.
For 26 long years this internationally-recognised collection was tucked away in the Reference Room of Walsall Library. But after a concerted campaign for it to be showcased in a setting befitting its importance, Walsall's purpose-built a New Art Gallery was opened, fanfares blaring, by the Queen in May 2000.
It had cost £21 million of public money, mostly in the form of National Lottery grants.
In return came confident predictions that it would be the catalyst for an epic renewal of the town centre, embracing its canal basin, much in the  way that the rejuvenated Gas Street Basin had proved such a tonic for nearby Birmingham.
Walsall felt entitled to believe it was in good company: other towns and cities had tried and tested the concept of prestige cultural gambits in this civic equivalent of Bruce Forsyth's (Re)Generation Game. Down the road in West Bromwich, plans were well advanced for the £72 million digital creative centre, 'The Public', which was to open, two years, late in 2008.
But what had seemed to be very much the vogue in the 'noughties met its reality check soon enough. In the roll call of casualties, the first, and still the most spectacular,  was 'The Public' itself, axed by Sandwell Council who could no longer justify the £30,000 in subsidies each week in the face of dwindling visitor numbers.
It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to report that Walsall's magnificent gallery now faces the real possibility of going the same way.
After the financial crash has come the austerity "squeeze" on public spending. Our local authorities' vaulting ambitions have given way to the apparently unending grind of budgeting for the care of their  aging populations while making sure the bins still get emptied.
Walsall's Labour-controlled council proposes to axe its £470,000 a year subsidy to the New Art Gallery. This would mean, in turn, that Arts Council England could no longer make good the loss, leaving the town's first major new public building  since its Victorian Town Hall facing the distinct threat of closure in four years' time.
"How can this be?" I asked myself when the realisation dawned.  I had bought wholesale into the grand vision of a 'cultural  treasure trove' which was bound to be a prime attraction for local people and would also bring arts aficionados flocking to the town with their wallets open.
I was even more surprised to discover in a recent article in 'The Sunday Times' (13th November 2016) by the BBC's former Arts Correspondent Rosie Millard that the gallery's annual visitor numbers, far from being  calculated in the millions I had expected, were actually running at a paltry 172,000 a year. Compare that with the new Library of Birmingham's 2.5 million visitors-a-year which puts it among  Britain's top ten attractions.
I realise I am being controversial when I say this, but maybe that's the difference between a mid-sized industrial town and one of the UK's most-visited cities outside London. Discuss!
This week's planned public protest in Walsall against the threatened funding cuts is a relatively rare rare display of public support for the New Gallery: one of my colleagues at BBC WM found it hard work to finding people at street level in the town who knew or cared much about it.
A prominent figure in the arts community told me privately: "It's a pity Walsall is not a tourist destination, and never will be: local people aren't bothered about the gallery and the people who are bothered don't go to Walsall".
Ouch!
If that's got your hackles rising, I hope you'll join us for this weekend's "Sunday Politics Midlands" when we'll have more on this.
We'll be in our usual 11.00 slot on BBC One this Sunday 4 December 2016.

article "Who woulda put a penny on me?"
Once Upon a Time in America, that gritty and at times extremely violent 1984 gangster film, is a favourite of 35-year-old Vyacheslav Senchenko.
"The movie makes sense to me," Senchenko told BBC Sport from his base in Donetsk.
"In it there is a true friendship and treachery. De Niro shows what a real man should be."
The rangy Ukrainian, a former WBA world welterweight belt holder, is aiming to spring from that starting gate and finish the night one of De Niro's winners, and real men, when he takes on Ricky Hatton in Manchester on 24 November.
"I'm sure that Ricky will be in very good form, and I expect a good fight," said Senchenko.
"I've seen Hatton's fights. He is a really strong boxer with an attacking manner - but I plan to conduct this fight in my own manner."
Once Upon a Time charts the rise then fall of De Niro's leading man, David 'Noodles' Aaronson. Towards the end we see an aged Noodles as a shadow of his former self.
The thousands inside Manchester Arena already know they will witness two fighters who, like Noodles at the finish, are closer to their ends than their beginnings.
Hatton has not thrown a punch in anger in years, while only Senchenko knows whether he bears any resemblance to the fighter whose record shows 32 wins from 33 contests, 21 by knockout.
The first and so far only defeat of his career came in his most recent bout in April, at the gloves of American Paulie Malignaggi, a 31-year-old whom Hatton himself beat in November 2008.
Malignaggi, the current WBA title holder, could well be a future target for the newly unretired Hatton. But in the build-up to his sold-out Manchester comeback, The Hitman spent much time emphasising the challenge posed by his immediate opponent.
"It sums me up - I'm straight in at the deep end against a former world champion in Senchenko," Hatton told the assembled media.
I've seen Hatton's fights. He is really strong boxer with an attacking manner
"He's probably the best opponent I could have picked. I've never gone for an easy opponent in my life and nothing's changed.
"Fighting him shows how serious I am. He's dangerous, but he's someone I can get my teeth into. I'm fighting him, and I won't let you down."
Much has been made of Hatton's quest for redemption since he announced his return to the ring after a three-year absence dogged by self-loathing and drug abuse.
But for Senchenko, who has only once fought outside his native Ukraine or neighbouring Russia, a high-profile win over Hatton on his opponent's turf would do wonders for his international profile.
"I'm not distracted by the fact Malignaggi lost to Hatton. I drew my own conclusions after my own defeat," he insisted.
"When I heard the news [of the Hatton fight] I was very glad - I am motivated by the possibility of fighting a strong and well-known rival, and now I want to become world champion once again."
However, many have dismissed Senchenko after his bloody defeat to Malignaggi.
Never the heaviest hitter, the New Yorker nonetheless triumphed in front of thousands inside the Donbass Arena with well-executed jabs - his punch landed 62% of the time and made a mess of the Ukrainian's left eye.
And the only Briton ever to have fought Senchenko, Wolverhampton fighter Stuart Elwell, told BBC Sport that a flurry of Hatton body shots and upper-cuts thrown at close range should do for his opponent.
"On paper Senchenko looks risky but the thing that struck me most when I fought him in Ukraine was despite the glossy record and world title he always looked scared and nervous. If that was the case for a home fight then when he enters the Manchester Arena and hears thousands of Brits screaming for his head I think the moment will fold him up like a beach chair. He's not bad but the atmosphere will bother him and Hatton should do the rest."
Paulie Malignaggi fought and beat Vyacheslav Senchenko in April 2012.
"To be honest, I think Ricky Hatton is the perfect fighter to beat him," said Elwell.
"[Senchenko] doesn't like being pushed back, and when I was pushing on to him he didn't seem to have any answers that a fighter of quality would have.
"Hatton is a pressure fighter and I don't think Senchenko will be able to deal with that. I predict Hatton inside six rounds."
Then, of course, there will be the unique experience of fighting in front of a vocal and highly partisan Hatton support. The comeback fight sold out a week after it was announced, even though no opponent had then been named.
Is Senchenko worried? "No. I've already boxed at Donbass Arena, which contains 50,000 people. I think that in Manchester the atmosphere will be approximately the same. His fans won't disturb me - I will be concentrating on the fight, and his supporters will be not a hindrance."
Hatton professes to be fighting fit and keen, but in Senchenko he faces a boxer whose pride, not to mention face, was hurt in his last bout.
Both men are veteran fighters who have given their lives to the sport. And both will be desperate for success in front of thousands in Manchester, if only to lend weight to another of De Niro's assertions in Sergio Leone's epic 80s drama: "It'd be a shame to see a lifetime of work go to waste."

article The controversial practice is based on the principle that "like cures like", but critics say patients are being given useless sugar pills.
The Faculty of Homeopathy said the therapy had "profound effects" and patients backed it.
A consultation is expected to take place in 2016.
The total NHS bill for homeopathy, including homeopathic hospitals and GP prescriptions, is thought to be about Â£4m.
Homeopathy is based on the concept that diluting a version of a substance that causes illness has healing properties.
So pollen or grass could be used to create a homeopathic hay-fever remedy.
One part of the substance is mixed with 99 parts of water or alcohol, and this is repeated six times in a "6c" formulation or 30 times in a "30c" formulation.
The end result is combined with a lactose (sugar) tablet.
Homeopaths say the more diluted it is, the greater the effect. Critics say patients are getting nothing but sugar.
Common homeopathic treatments are for asthma, ear infections, hay-fever, depression, stress, anxiety, allergy and arthritis.

But the NHS itself says: "There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition."
The Good Thinking Society has been campaigning for homeopathy to be added to the NHS blacklist - known formally as Schedule 1 - of drugs that cannot be prescribed by GPs.
Drugs can be blacklisted if there are cheaper alternatives or if the medicine is not effective.
After the Good Thinking Society threatened to take their case to the courts, Department of Health legal advisers replied in emails that ministers had "decided to conduct a consultation".
Officials have now confirmed this will take place in 2016.
Simon Singh, the founder of the Good Thinking Society, said: "Given the finite resources of the NHS, any spending on homeopathy is utterly unjustifiable.
"The money spent on these disproven remedies can be far better spent on treatments that offer real benefits to patients."
But Dr Helen Beaumont, a GP and the president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, said other drugs such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) for depression would be a better target for saving money, as homeopathic pills had a "profound effect" on patients.
She told the BBC News website: "Patient choice is important; homeopathy works, it's widely used by doctors in Europe, and patients who are treated by homeopathy are really convinced of its benefits, as am I."
The result of the consultation would affect GP prescribing, but not homeopathic hospitals which account for the bulk of the NHS money spent on homeopathy.
Estimates suggest GP prescriptions account for about Â£110,000 per year.
And any decision would not affect people buying the treatments over the counter or privately.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was criticised for supporting a parliamentary motion on homeopathy, but in an interview last year argued "when resources are tight we have to follow the evidence".
Minister for Life Sciences, George Freeman, told the BBC: "With rising health demands, we have a duty to make sure we spend NHS funds on the most effective treatments.
"We are currently considering whether or not homeopathic products should continue to be available through NHS prescriptions.
"We expect to consult on proposals in due course."

article Wills played companion Polly to William Hartnell's grandfatherly first Doctor and Patrick Troughton's scruffy second incarnation in 1966-67.
The show's producers decided to "regenerate" the lead role when Hartnell's health declined.
Saturday is the 50th anniversary of The Power of the Daleks, Troughton's debut.
The six-part adventure sees Troughton's time lord, and his Tardis companions, Polly and Ben (Michael Craze), do battle with the evil Daleks on the planet Vulcan.
To mark the anniversary, BBC Worldwide is releasing a black-and-white animated reconstruction of the "lost" story, based on surviving photographs and audio recordings.
Speaking at a screening of the first two episodes, Wills recalled how various actors - including Michael Horden and singer Tommy Steele - auditioned for the role of the new Doctor.
"We all knew Bill [William Hartnell] was going to leave at the end of the summer season, and then there were discussions about is that the end of the show or shall we have another actor," she said.
"When we heard it was Patrick, we knew that we had a chance.
"But we still didn't know if the audience would accept it and accept that the Doctor could change his body.
"And it was entirely up to Patrick that the audience did.
"In the animation you see how adorable he was, you couldn't resist him. And they didn't resist him.
"So luckily it was him and we're all here talking about it."
In this interview, Anneke Wills talks about about her memories of 1960s Doctor Who and what she think of Peter Capaldi's 12th Doctor.
This is the first time ever the Doctor changes his body.
For us at the time, it was a momentous moment.
Were we going to have a Bill Hartnell lookalike? Or someone totally different?
There were all these different names coming up. But also, as an actor, you were thinking: "I hope I'll be in work at the end of the summer break."
Bill had become very difficult to work with - we had to be very generous and kind and pick up his lines.
The thing about Patrick was that he had no ego. That was an astounding thing.
I think his performance in this story is the most astounding of all the Doctors - and I've watched them all.
We had two weeks of rehearsal so Patrick had extra time to get into the role.
He put on his Harpo Marx curly wig, and Michael Craze said: "If you're going to wear that, I'm not bloody working with you," and went off for a smoke.
I was worried we were wasting time, so I took a comb out of someone's pocket and combed his hair forward in a Beatles style and messed it up a bit.
There was a silence as Patrick looked in the mirror.
And then he said: "I like it."
We did that in those days. We never saw any of the work that we'd done. It was like rep theatre.  You'd do a wonderful performance and then it's gone.
Now, looking back, it seems a terrible waste.
I love that Polly and Ben have been brought back [in animated form] because there's so little of us that survives.
I would love it if they would do The Smugglers [a swashbuckling Troughton story from 1966], next I'd love to see The Crusade [a 1965 first Doctor adventure starring Julian Glover as Richard the Lionheart], and Fury of the Deep [a second Doctor sea-monster story from 1968].
Wouldn't it be wonderful? I don't know any more than the fans. They always think that I've got secrets, but I haven't .
If anybody's got one in their cupboard bring it forth - now is the moment.
Someone should make a spy thriller about the search for the missing episodes of Doctor Who.
Polly was created as a proactive young woman and, in a way, that hasn't changed. However, I take exception when the companion slaps the Doctor. That makes me really angry.
That scares me to bits. All these wrinkles in high definition? I don't think so.
I talked to Peter Capaldi. I think he's astounding. He's luminous.
He asked me if there was a lot of pressure in the 1960s and I said we'd start rehearsals on a Monday, and he said: "You rehearse?"
Yes. Of course I'd take on the challenge. Maybe I could be in a wonderful mask.

article More than 240 people have died and at least 368 were injured, officials said.
Many people are still believed to be buried under rubble and more than 4,300 rescuers are using heavy lifting equipment and bare hands to find them.
Many of the victims were children, the health minister said, and there were warnings the toll could rise further.
Early on Thursday, Italy's civil protection authorities said a total of 247 people were now known to have died, with 190 deaths reported in Rieti province and 57 in neighbouring Ascoli Piceno province.
Rescuers said they had pulled five bodies from the ruins of the Hotel Roma in the historic town of Amatrice. Officials said about 35 people had been staying at the hotel and most had managed to get out. About 10 people were still unaccounted for, a local fire official said.
Late on Wednesday there were cheers in the village of Pescara del Tronto when a young girl was pulled alive from the rubble after being trapped for 17 hours. Almost all the houses there had collapsed, the mayor said.
The 6.2-magnitude quake hit at 03:36 (01:36 GMT) on Wednesday 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome.
Hardest hit were the small towns and villages in the mountainous area where the regions of Umbria, Lazio and Le Marche meet.
People there spent the night outside or in tents provided by the emergency services.
Among the victims was an 18-month-old toddler, Marisol Piermarini, whose mother Martina Turco survived the deadly 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila and moved away from there after the experience, Italian news agency Ansa reported.
Ms Turco was being treated in hospital after being pulled from the rubble in the village of Arquata del Tronto, Ansa said.
The area has also been shaken by strong aftershocks, including a 4.7-magnitude tremor with its epicentre about 7km east of Norcia, according to the US Geological Survey.
The mayor of Amatrice said three-quarters of the town had been destroyed and no building was safe for habitation.
Many of those affected were on holiday in the region. Some were in Amatrice for a festival to celebrate a famous local speciality - amatriciana bacon and tomato sauce.
The country is no stranger to earthquakes: the 2009 L'Aquila tremor killed more than 300 people and in May 2012 two tremors nine days apart killed more than 20 people in the northern Emilia Romagna region.
Earthquakes are an ever-present danger for those who live along the Apennine mountain range in Italy.
Through the centuries thousands have died as a result of tremors equal to, or not much bigger than, the event that struck in the early hours of Wednesday. The modern response, thankfully, has been more robust building and better preparation.
Mediterranean seismicity is driven by the great collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates; but when it comes down to the specifics of this latest quake, the details are far more complicated.
The Tyrrhenian Basin, or Sea, which lies to the west of Italy, between the mainland and Sardinia/Corsica, is slowly opening up.
Scientists say this is contributing to extension, or "pull-apart", along the Apennines.  This stress is compounded by movement in the east, in the Adriatic.
The result is a major fault system that runs the length of the mountain range with a series of smaller faults that fan off to the sides. The foundations of cities like Perugia and L'Aquila stand on top of it all.

article The troops died in "unprovoked" firing overnight in the Bhimber sector on the Line of Control (LoC). India blamed Pakistan for starting the clash.
It is thought to be the Pakistani military's biggest single loss of life in Kashmir since a 2003 truce.
Tensions have flared over the long-running dispute since an Indian army base was attacked in September.
Both India and Pakistan accuse each other of violating the 2003 ceasefire agreement.
Both sides have reported civilians and a number of soldiers being killed or injured in recent weeks, during which time the LoC has seen intense exchanges of fire.
Hundreds of civilians in villages along the LoC have been evacuated.
Did India really "surgically strike" Kashmir militants?

What is Kashmir?
The teenager blinded by pellets in Indian Kashmir
The territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Muslim-majority Kashmir has been running for decades.
Both nuclear-armed states claim the territory in its entirety but control only parts of it. Two of the three wars fought between the two sides since independence have been over Kashmir.
After the 18 September army base attack on the Indian-administered side, the Indian military said it had carried out "surgical strikes" against suspected militants along the LoC.
Pakistan called the strikes an "illusion" and denied Indian claims it was behind the militant attack.
A subsequent BBC investigation found that while India did not airdrop commandos to hit militant camps or conduct ground assaults deep into Pakistani-administered territory, troops did cross the LoC a significant distance to hit border posts and then pulled back.
Pakistan said two soldiers were killed in the strikes. Two more are reported to have died in cross-border firing since.

article Moray Council has granted Elgin Energy planning permission for a 20MW project near Urquhart, which could see about 80,000 solar panels installed.
The farm will be constructed on the 47-hectare Speyslaw site - the equivalent of about 40 football pitches.
The largest Scottish solar farm is currently a 13MW project at Errol Estate in Perthshire, which went live in May last year.
Bristol-based Elgin Energy also developed that scheme, which includes 55,000 solar panels capable of generating power for more than 3,500 homes,.
A date for the start of the project has yet to be set.
The project will include a substation, 20 inverter stations and a CCTV camera system.
All cabling at the site - spread over three fields at the Innes Estate - will be underground, allowing sheep to graze around the panels.
Permission for the solar farm is valid for 30 years, after which the developer will have one year to decommission the works and restore the site to a condition agreed with the council.
A habitat management plan must also be approved by the council before works can begin.
In a statement, Elgin Energy said: "Existing field boundaries will not be disturbed and mature hedgerows will provide generous screening for the site.
"Elgin Energy has contacted those neighbours in the immediate vicinity of the site and has offered to answer any queries which might arise.
"The land will remain in agricultural use in the form of sheep grazing while being used for the dual purpose of generating low-carbon renewable energy."
Councillor Claire Feaver, chairwoman of Moray Council's Planning and Regulatory Services Committee, said: "A significant amount of renewable energy will be generated by this solar farm over the next 30 years.
"The opportunity to continue grazing on the land, together with the habitat management plan, will maintain and enhance the diverse range of species in and around the site.
"I see this as a win-win."
Scottish Renewables welcomed news that the Speyslaw project had been given the go-ahead.
Policy manager Stephanie Clark said: "Large-scale solar has played a part in Scotland since 2005 and we are now beginning to see more applications for commercial projects coming forward.
"North east Scotland's clear skies and longer daylight hours mean the area is attractive to developers.
"Large schemes like this one are able to use that resource to provide clean electricity which will help Scotland meet its climate change targets.
"Further progress in the solar sector, however, depends on the level of support provided by the UK government through the Feed-in Tariff and the Contracts for Difference schemes, both of which remain the subject of much uncertainty."
Elgin Energy, which has already developed 250MW of solar across 24 projects in the UK and Ireland, is planning an even bigger farm in Moray.
It is seeking planning permission for a 50MW project at the former RAF Milltown airfield, a few miles north east of Elgin.
A decision on that application is not expected until early next year.

article The event is part of an art exhibition at the 20-21 Visual Arts Centre, which began on Saturday 18 February.
To find and keep the pieces, worth at least Â£1,000 each, people must study five paintings and solve the code within them.
One of the items was found by accident so a reward is being offered to anyone who can solve the clue linked to it.
Artist Luke Jerram said he would donate Â£500 to a charity of the finder's choice if they could solve the mystery of the "red picture".
The fourth item, the golden train, was found by a family from Grimsby in Scunthorpe's Central Park on Friday night.
Mr Jerram said he had not anticipated so many items would be discovered in the first week.
"I was expecting two or three, something like that. What I did not expect was the response of the public would be so astonishingly positive.
"I did not expect the public would go round looking in every nook and cranny of the town to try and find the artefacts."
The Visual Arts Centre said the public response had been extraordinary.
"It has created a real buzz around the place and brought in thousands of people," said the centre's visual arts officer Michelle Lally.
The final item to be found is the gold copy of a Jurassic ammonite, an ancient marine mollusc fossil.
The five objects are replicas of pieces at North Lincolnshire Museum and were made from gold worth Â£1,000, but could be worth much more.

article The trade union Unite says that the shop floor jobs are to go from the firm's "complementary labour force".
That part of the workforce is made up from temporary and contract workers and tends to fluctuate depending on demand.
The company confirmed that up to 130 contract workers are being let go and described it as "regrettable".
Last year, Bombardier cut 300 temporary and contract jobs and made 90 people redundant from the permanent workforce.
The aerospace company is one of Northern Ireland's biggest employers.
About 5,000 permanent employees and about 1,000 temporary and contract staff work at its Belfast base.
In a statement, Bombardier said "the need to be competitive" meant the company had to make adjustments to its staffing levels.
Bombardier has had a difficult few years with the development of its C Series plane badly delayed and a business jet project suspended.
That has been reflected in its Northern Ireland workforce - Tuesday's announcement brings the number of job losses to more than 500 in six months.
Last week, the Canadian firm appointed a new chief executive in an attempt to find a way out of the current problems.
The new man, Alain Bellemare, needs to convince more airlines to buy the C Series, an aircraft which has cost more than $5bn to develop.
"Our manpower situation is kept under constant review.  We have reviewed our latest requirements based on current customer demand," the firm said.
"Up until mid-2014, we had increased our complementary labour force by over 1,000 positions, but lately we have had to reduce this level."
A spokesman for the union Unite said the cuts were "another savage blow" to the company's workforce.
Regional coordinating officer Davy Thompson said: "This announcement highlights the inadequacy of existing employment protection, in particular for that afforded to agency workers who are making up more and more of the Northern Ireland labour force.
"There's a need for Stormont politicians to get serious on action to improve job security protections for workers, particularly within the manufacturing sector where there is a real risk of de-skilling."

article A Dara McVeety goal in the 25th-minute helped Terry Hyland's men establish a 1-9 to 0-7 half-time lead.
Martin Reilly converted a penalty 10 minutes into the second half after Cian Mackey had been brought down.
Armagh had a chance to cut their deficit to three but Stefan Campbell's weak penalty was saved by home goalkeeper Raymond Galligan.
Seanie Johnston, up against his former boss at Kildare Kieran McGeeney, landed seven points and was one of Cavan's eight scorers on the day.
Just three players were on target for the Orange County and in the end they fell well short.
Armagh played an outfield man in goals, Ballyhegan club man Paul Courtney making his Championship debut.
He was unable to keep out Reilly's penalty while, soon afterwards, his opposite number Raymond Galligan saved Campbell's poorly directed effort.
Armagh made a decent enough start, scoring three of the first four points.
But five unanswered scores - three of them from Johnston - saw things swing the way of the favourites, and there were seven points in it when Reilly advanced to feed McVeety who netted from close-range.
Tony Kernan and Ethan Rafferty got the last two scores of the half, but Armagh still trailed by five at the break.
It looked all over when Reilly's penalty made it 2-11 to 0-9, but Armagh had a great chance to ignite the contest when Killian Clarke's foul on Campbell resulted in a penalty.
However, Campbell's kick was too close to Galligan who saved and Cavan went straight up the pitch to go 2-13 to 0-12 up through Johnston. Then, it really was over.

article Adilson Tavares Varela, known as Cabral, told Hull Crown Court he had consensual sex with the 22-year-old woman at his flat in Gateshead.
The ex-Sunderland midfielder denied being "persistent, forceful and aggressive" and said he stopped having sex with her when she asked him to.
He denies two counts of rape.
The woman has told the jury Varela pinned her down on his bed and raped her after they met during a night out in Newcastle.
But the footballer said they kissed and danced together before going back to his home with friends, including retired French international Anthony Reveillere.
He said the woman asked him to go into the bedroom.
When asked about her behaviour, Varela said: "It was normal. It was a normal girl who wanted to have sex with me.
"It seemed to me she was used to doing this as she was in no way ashamed."
He told the court he removed all of his clothes except for his socks and that he and the woman had sex in two positions.
Speaking through an interpreter, Cape Verde-born Varela told the jury the woman asked him to stop after around 15 minutes because she was tired.
He said he stopped and swore at her in French because he felt "frustrated".
Varela, who has a fiancee and a three-year-old son who live in Switzerland, told the court he got dressed and returned to the others in the living room, where he sent a message to a woman he described as a "sex buddy".
He said the complainant later left his flat with the others and was upset because she thought her mother would be angry with her.
Varela now plays for Swiss team FC Zurich. The trial continues.

article It follows a National Audit Office (NAO) report, which revealed that the rollout will cost at least £92m less than BT had originally said.
The government said that the spare cash would be ploughed back into offering fast broadband to more remote areas.
BT said that the  claim - made by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) - was "bizarre".
PAC told the BBC it questioned why BT had told the committee it would cost so much more.
"Although it's reassuring that the cost to the public purse could end up being £92m (25%) less than what BT had originally forecast in its bid, I worry that this does not stack up with what BT told my committee in 2013 - that it factors in a contingency of between 5% and 8%, which might not get spent, a much smaller proportion than 25%," Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC, told the BBC.
"It is very concerning that it looks like BT could have abused its dominant position in the market by vastly overestimating forecast costs in the first place when it put in its original bid, and we also have broader concerns about whether the deal represents value for money."
In response BT said that its initial cost estimates were "based on our initial view of how much it would cost to deploy fibre in rural areas".
"We have come in under budget in several areas which is good news for the taxpayer as we only charge for the costs we incur, not those we first forecast. The savings can now be reinvested to take fibre to additional areas."
"The suggestion we inflated those costs is bizarre as by doing so we would have hindered our chances of winning the work."
"The NAO report this week confirmed our costs were 20% below those others would have charged in a sample area, so we are clearly delivering excellent value for money."
The distribution of broadband is overseen by Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK), part of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS).
The report found "significantly lower" costs than listed in BT's financial model for the first phase of the scheme.
"As at September 2014, BT's total reported capital spend on phase 1 of the programme was £142 million (38%) under the estimated price, including work in progress not yet invoiced," the NAO said.
Taking into account possible further costs, BT would still have spent "approximately £92m less", the report concludes.
This sum will be ploughed back into rural rollouts, the DCMS said.
"The savings realised so far, along with with projected future savings, will be reinvested in extending the current rollout plans."
Several reports have found that rural businesses, schools and homes are at a significant disadvantage because of poor broadband.
Bringing faster services to remote areas has proved to be highly controversial.
Questions have been raised about the time it has taken the government to start the rollout and whether the plans are ambitious enough.
Last year the Public Accounts Committee accused the government of mismanaging the project, and said BT released "wildly inaccurate" estimates of costs.
Mrs Hodge said at the time: "The taxpayer has been ripped off, with £1.2bn going to the shareholders of BT."
BT's status as the only operator providing rural broadband could actually be one of the reasons for costs being cut, said Andrew Ferguson, editor of the ThinkBroadband news site.
"It is interesting that a chunk of the savings are down to the fact that only one supplier won all the contracts, increasing the economies of scale, at the expense of competition," he said.
Mike Kiely, a former adviser to BDUK, has long argued that BT's estimates of the cost of distributing broadband to rural areas were far too high.
He felt vindicated by the findings, saying: "Thirty-eight per cent excess costs have been confirmed in the cost models used to calculate the milestone payments.  Those monies - and there will be more - need to be used to extend the fibre rollout further."
He and others argue that BT should think about offering even faster broadband - by taking so-called "fibre-to-the-premise" technology, which offers significantly higher speeds than BT's preferred technology of "fibre-to-the-cabinet".
BT hopes to deliver speeds of up to 500Mbps (megabits per second) to homes via an innovative technology known as G.fast.
"We believe G.fast is the key to unlocking ultrafast speeds and we are prepared to upgrade large parts of our network should the pilots prove successful," chief executive Gavin Patterson said.
The firm expects to offer initial speeds of a few hundred megabits per second to millions of homes and businesses by 2020.

As the whistle blows at the start of Saturday's FA Cup final, they won't be playing on the pitch - but they'll have worked on it.
And while the players regroup in the dressing room at half time, the Greenmount students will be making running repairs to the grass to keep the stars safe.
It's all down to their tutor who entered them as a team in a professional green-keeping skills competition, which they won.
"The prize is an all-expenses trip to Wembley to the FA Cup final to see how exactly the pitch is maintained and how it's looked after and what goes into the preparations for a final," said Gavin White, who is a Horticulture foundation degree student.
And as first year Sports Turf student Michael Dundee explained, they will also get to take over the pitch at half-time and after the match.
"At half-time we'll go out with the forks to repair the divots and then again help the team to repair the pitch and clear up the pitch ready for the play-off games on Sunday," he said.
The four students are all at different stages of learning, but they pulled together for the opportunity to brush shoulders with the likes of Cech, Costa, Sanchez and Ozil.
For Level-3 Sports Turf student John Kennedy, it's a professional dream.
"It's a fantastic opportunity to see a stadium maintained at such a high standard," he said.
But for football fan and Level Three ground-keeping student Jon Crawford, it's the trip of a lifetime.
"It's pretty exciting that it's Chelsea in the final, being a massive Chelsea fan," he said.
"After such a good season it's nice to be able to see them and especially to go to Wembley to do it as well."
He will also be hoping to grab a little taste of the limelight for himself.
"I'll just go out on the pitch and maybe swing my arms about so people can see me on TV or something," he laughed.
But there'll be no time for celebrating at the end of the match.
The four will be hard at it with the Wembley ground-keeping team, repairing the pitch for the play-offs the next day.

article With five tower blocks being evacuated, the streets were teeming with neighbours, children, and cameramen.
Camden Council employees wearing hi-viz vests stood outside the Taplow tower, speaking to residents.
Some of them only realised their homes were being evacuated after hearing news reports.
Emmanuel, 18, said they had "not been told anything".
"I'm angry to an extent that they didn't tell us sooner."
During live broadcasts, one woman shouted angrily at a TV cameraman: "Can you tell me what's going on?"
There was a steady trickle of families walking out of Taplow with an array of suitcases, satchels and bags for life.
An elderly man called George, wearing a suit and carrying a small duffle bag, was trying to re-enter the complex.
His neighbour shouted: "They'll only kick you out again George. Your best bet is to go back to the leisure centre."
George - like many other residents - did not want to speak to the media.
Many residents were sent to the Swiss Cottage leisure centre, to learn where their temporary accommodation would be.
Some people said that - despite the evacuation - they wanted to stay at home.
By 21:00 BST, council employees were going floor-by-floor to tell residents who did not know about the evacuation.
Brian, who lives on the fifth floor of Taplow tower, said: "It's a weird time to kick people out, especially as it's most children's bedtime."
Hampstead and Kilburn MP Tulip Siddiq said: "I realise it's disruptive to people's lives but constituents safety comes first.
"If it's not safe then people need to go."
The Labour MP said it was a "tough decision" for Camden Council to make, but added: "This building is not safe for our residents.
"Our council could not let residents stay overnight."
Edward Strange was travelling to Salisbury with his family when news broke on the radio. They turned back immediately to find out what was going on.
He said that the evacuation was a "complete overreaction", adding that two previous fires in Taplow were "easily contained".
He intended to stay with friends for the first night, but said he could not impose his family on them for much longer.
Camden Council has said the works could take up to four weeks.
The number of residents being evacuated from the 800 homes is unknown, but it could be in the thousands.
Ms Siddiq said that the council had block-booked hotel rooms and were offering them to all residents.
Four miles from the Chalcots estate stands the charred remains of Grenfell Tower.
At least 79 people are feared dead after a fire engulfed the 24-storey building earlier this month.
Camden Council leader Georgia Gould said: "I know it's difficult, but Grenfell changes everything."
Louise Simons, who lives in nearby Primrose Hill, came to the tower blocks to offer any displaced residents a spare bed for the evening.
"We live locally and have been impacted by the events of Grenfell," she said. "Obviously we wanted to help."

article Maamria, 44, took charge in November after former manager Paul Carden left by mutual consent.
The Sandgrounders are without a win in their last five home games and let a 3-0 lead slip in Saturday's 3-3 draw with struggling Welling United.
They are 17th in the table, but eight points above the relegation zone with eight games left to play.
In his final interview prior to his departure, Maamria said his side needed to lose their uncertainty if they were to improve their inconsistent league form.
"For some reason the team at home are very hesitant and I've got to find out why," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"That's been happening before my time here and we need to get to the bottom of it to give the players confidence."
After winning four consecutive home matches following his appointment in November, Southport are yet to win at Haig Avenue since the beginning of January.
"Ranting is going to get you nowhere because these are the players I inherited and I've got to work with them at least until the end of the season," Maamria added.
"From day one I said I don't really get sucked into the table too much because you end up losing focus on the next game."

article Doune Castle, near Stirling, is portrayed as the fictional Castle Leoch, the seat of Clan MacKenzie.
It also featured as Camelot in the film Monty Python and The Holy Grail and in the pilot episode of Game of Thrones.
Historic Scotland figures show year-on-year visitor numbers to the castle have grown by 30.2% to 49,553 in 2014/15.
The TV series follows the story of Claire Randell, a nurse from 1946 who is swept back in time to 1743.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "Doune Castle is just the latest location to report the 'Outlander effect'.
"From Dumfries to Inverness, historic visitor attractions are reporting a rise in visitor numbers thanks to the popularity of the TV show and renewed interest in the novels.
"Canada, the USA and Australia, where the series is shown, all have a shared history with Scotland, and Outlander is a great introduction to our must-visit country.
"We hope that visitor numbers increase further as viewers in the UK and Germany get to enjoy the programme."
Outlander is based on novels by US author Diana Gabaldon.
Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, said: "Scotland is the land that inspired Outlander and our locations map has already proved a big hit with visitors with many making the journey to stunning locations within the series such as Doune Castle.
"Furthermore, we are seeing more and more tourism businesses, including accommodation providers and visitor attractions, looking at ways in which they can capitalise on the show."
Ms Hyslop will travel to New York and Los Angeles for Scotland Week, attending a series of business, tourism, cultural and film industry engagements.

article Sanderson proved unplayable with a fine display of swing bowling to earn the visitors their first Championship win of the season.
Set 347 to win, Glamorgan slipped to 12-4 and never showed the application to survive as they were all out for 95.
Sanderson also picked up 10 wickets in a match for the first time.
Northants might have won even sooner if they had not dropped a series of slip catches.
Only three players reached double figures, Mark Wallace with a gritty 28 not out and Aneurin Donald the joint top-scorers, while there were four ducks in a miserable home display in the Swansea sunshine.
A Championship-best 5-61 from Timm van der Gugten was the sole high point of the final day for Glamorgan, whose seamer Ruaidhri Smith will miss four to six weeks with a side strain.
Both sides are involved in T20 Blast quarter-finals with Northants taking on Middlesex on Tuesday, 9 August and Glamorgan facing Yorkshire on Thursday, 11 August.
Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport:
"I thought the pitch seamed around quite a lot today and their boys bowled really well today, straight, really accurately and consistently- every good ball we edged, or it broke our defences so it was a perfect storm.
"We are disappointed but we knew we'd rested a few players, we knew there was a risk, but we've also learned about some young players.
"It was exciting to see young debutant Lukas Carey doing well and Nick Selman with a fantastic hundred.
"We've lost this game but we've had an opportunity to rest some players (for the T20) who hopefully will be fresh for Thursday, and to see what some of our younger players have."
Northants bowler Ben Sanderson told BBC Radio Northampton:
"I felt really good, just ran in and seemed to do the right things, hit the right areas and it's easy on days like that.
"Conditions weren't helping with the sunshine so we worked really hard on the ball and kept it in good condition, credit to the boys.
"To come here and get the wickets is brilliant for me, a real confidence-booster, and we've put in a performance that should carry us on for the rest of the season.
"We played well at Arundel and we've played some good cricket in this comp but not had the luck until today."
summary Glamorgan beat Glamorganshire by a narrow margin to win the Championship.

article The biggest tour group to visit the country was welcomed in the southern resort of Nice on Saturday.
Tiens Group president Li Jinyuan booked up 140 hotels in Paris and more than 4,700 rooms in Cannes and Monaco for their trip.
Their holiday included a private viewing of the Louvre museum and a mass visit to the Moulin Rouge cabaret show.
On Friday, Guinness World Records' inspectors watched the group line up on a beach to break the record for the longest "human-made phrase".
Local media say that the group is expected to spend some â‚¬13m ($14.6m; Â£9.5m) in total.
"We have mobilised public services as well as tourism professionals, hotels, restaurants, shops and designer brands," said Christian Mantel, head of tourism development agency Atout France.
"So far everything has gone smoothly, the feedback has been extremely positive," he said, as quoted by the Agence France-Presse news agency.
The tourists have hired 146 buses to drive them around for the duration of their holiday.
The Tiens Group has business interests in a number of fields, including tourism, trade and cosmetics.

article The party said details of how the "carefully costed" plans would be paid for would be set out in its general election manifesto.
It said the policy would give the average public sector worker a pay rise of Â£779.
But the Conservatives said only they could deliver "strong public services".
Under Tory government policy, a 1% pay cap for public sector workers is in place in a bid to "protect jobs and repair the finances".
Labour's leaked draft manifesto included plans to end the cap, and the Lib Dems said they would bring an end to "years of pitiful increases" by increasing wages in line with the Consumer Price Index, which was 2.3%, according to the latest figures.
"Our NHS and schools are already struggling to recruit the staff they need," said former Business Secretary Vince Cable.
"A better future is available. We will stand up for our schools and hospitals and give hard-working nurses, teachers and police the pay rise they deserve."

Fire crews arrived and were met with "a well-developed fire" and the house suffered "a partial collapse".
Police said the 63-year-old man was treated at the scene by paramedics. An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Police can confirm that an 88-year-old woman has died in a fire at Craigelvan Gardens in Cumbernauld and a 63-year-old man was also treated at the scene by paramedics.
"An investigation is under way to establish the exact cause of the fire."
A spokesman for the fire service said: "Teams in breathing apparatus entered the property to search for anyone inside and sadly they located a woman who had died.
"Firefighting operations were conducted both inside and outside the house and the fire was brought under control, however due to a partial structural collapse it is likely to be some time before crews can confirm it has been fully extinguished."

article The Sloan Digital Sky Survey's latest effort tops its own record, published publicly for professional astronomers and "citizen scientists" alike.
Data from Sloan has helped to identify hundreds of millions of cosmic objects.
The release was announced at the 217th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, US.
Researchers have released  an animation on YouTube demonstrating how the incredibly high-resolution image is represented on the celestial sphere.
Michael Blanton, a New York University physicist who presented the work on behalf of the Sloan team, told the conference that it was difficult to overstate the breadth of data Sloan provided.
"There's something like 3,500 papers that have been written on the basis of this data set," he said.
"A few dozen of them are being presented right now, this week at this meeting. They cover topics from the very smallest stars to the most massive black holes in the universe."
Nearly half a billion stars and galaxies have already been discovered and described thanks to Sloan images, and the new release is sure to significantly increase that number.
Sloan data is also behind the Google Sky service, which allows users to scan the heavens in the same way as scanning their local streets, and the Galaxy Zoo project, which has allowed astronomy enthusiasts to characterise galaxies from their own computers.
The workhorse behind the data set, a camera comprising 125 million pixels that long held the record for highest-resolution camera in the world, has been retired.
Studies will now focus on spectrometry - unpicking new data on the basis of the colours of light that the upgraded equipment can detect.
They include:
But even the data that is already available, thanks to Tuesday's release, will keep astronomers of both the professional and the amateur variety busy.
"You can compare it to the National Geographic Palomar Survey of the late 1950s," Dr Blanton said.
"This is something that 50 years later is still a really important reference to astronomers; we use it ourselves to better understand our own images. SDSS is the digital version of that."

article David Jones told a House of Lords committee the UK's negotiating position may not be "totally crystallised" by next spring.
Mr Jones said the government was at an early stage of the process and that thinking was "developing".
Theresa May has said Article 50 will be triggered by the end of March 2017.
This will put in process formal talks with the EU, which will last for up to two years before Brexit happens.
Mr Jones, a minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, was appearing before the EU Home Affairs sub-committee, which is investigating the security implications of Brexit.
He was questioned on what government departments hoped to get out of any eventual agreement with the EU.
Mr Jones said: "We wish to proceed at a pretty brisk pace, because clearly the work of my department covers the entirety of government.
"We would like to see our negotiating position, if not totally crystallised, at least worked up to a very high level by the time that Article 50 is finally triggered, so an early report from this committee would be very much appreciated."
Later, Mr Jones responded to a question from Conservative peer Lord Cormack, repeating the assertion.
He said: "I have to say, in all frankness, and I don't think you will be surprised if I do say this, we are at a relatively early stage of this process.
"Our thinking is developing and we are looking, as I said earlier, to have if not precisely crystallised at least a very highly developed position by the time we serve our Article 50 notice."
UK voters opted in favour of leaving the EU by 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum in June.
Several MPs have urged a parliamentary vote on what the government's position is before negotiations with the EU begin.
But the government says this is constitutionally unnecessary and could undermine its bargaining power as issues including access to the European single market and migration controls are discussed.

article Conte is close to winning the title in his first season in English football.
His side can move seven points clear with three games left if they beat Middlesbrough on Monday (20:00 BST).
"I think Tottenham have an advantage, if you compare Tottenham to Chelsea," said the Italian.
"This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Mauricio Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players and is working very well.
"For me, Tottenham are a really strong team and it's normal to see them fighting for the title."
Conte believes Spurs, who were Leicester City's main challengers in 2015-16 before fading to finish third, would have easily won the Premier League this season if it were not for his side's impressive season.
"In this season, if Chelsea had not performed in this way, Tottenham would win the title without difficulty," he said.
"Only this great season from us is pushing them to fight and, maybe, to win or not to win the title."
The former Juventus and Italy boss could lead his side to a league and FA Cup double, 10 months after Chelsea finished 10th, with an FA Cup final against Arsenal on 27 May.
Unlike some of their rivals, Chelsea have not been involved in Europe and Conte thinks it is difficult for English clubs to succeed in the Champions League because of the strength of the Premier League.
In the past six years, five English clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, compared to 17 from Spain and 10 in Germany.
Conte said: "This league is very difficult. Every single game you must fight a lot and, I think, also for this reason it's not easy to arrive at the end of a European competition.
"It is so clear here, every season will be tougher and tougher to qualify for the Champions League."

article The deal marks the latest initiative in China's keen pursuit of overseas high-speed rail deals.
Analysts say the project could open up the underdeveloped US high-speed rail market.
There are about a dozen high-speed rail projects in the US, but they have struggled to gain traction.
Private rail venture XpressWest will form a joint venture with China Railway International USA.
The firm is owned by a consortium made up of subsidiaries from state firms China Railway Group, CRRC, China State Construction Engineering Corporation and China Railway Signal & Communication Corporation.
Guotai Junan analyst Gary Wong estimated the XpressWest project was worth $5bn.
He said the deal would offer little financial benefit to China Railway International USA, but could help give the firm a foothold in the US high-speed rail market.
"If this opens up the United States market for them, opportunities for future expansion will increase. And if [their technology] is used in the United States, it will be easier for them to sell to other countries," he said.

Blaklion also advertised his National credentials as - for the first time in 20-odd years - ground conditions were decent (good to soft) for this fixture, so it was not the usual gut-wrenching slog.
The best two horses, both of whom have attractive weights in the 10 stones at Aintree, excelled, showing off their jumping ability and stamina in style. They will be big players on 8 April.

article He posted a video online saying too much money was spent on defence and it should go to the NHS instead.
New submarines carrying nuclear weapons are being designed at BAE Systems in Barrow, Cumbria.
Barrow Labour MP John Woodcock said he would rather be protected by a nuclear deterrent than an "eccentric comedian".
In his own online video he said: "This is a substantial investment, but the overall majority of this goes on employing the many thousands of the most highly-skilled engineers and manufacturers.
"I want us to have more to be able to defend this country than a sharp-witted, eccentric comedian.
"Come to Barrow and meet some of this workforce. Let's do this thing properly."
Brand had asked how the country could have a "properly-funded NHS".
"Is it at the expense of the arms industry? The answer is obviously yes," he said.
"As the NHS struggles against a £2bn funding gap this year the money diverted into Trident - £3.3bn being spent in the assessment phase, not to mention the £2-3bn we spend every year just running our current Trident system - reflects the choice our government has made."
He appeared to be quoting a New Statesman article by Kate Hudson from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in part of what he said.
Brand was unavailable for comment on Mr Woodcock's remarks and BAE declined to comment.
The firm's Barrow shipyard employs about 6,900 people. Around 1,400 of those are currently working on the Successor submarine replacement programme.
The government has put the cost of replacing Trident at £15-20bn, but campaigners have argued it will cost at least £34bn.
The replacement submarines are expected to come into operation in 2028.

article A growing and ageing population means more of us live with, or will one day need, care for long-term illnesses.
But are we - and that includes me - looking at health too much in terms of just how the NHS is operating?
Well, research suggests healthcare may in fact contribute as little as 10% towards the health and well-being of a country's population.
Or put it in another way: while the pressures on frontline services may dominate the news, the actual impact of those services to our health overall is actually relatively small.
Much more important, arguably, are things like the quality of our homes and the environment around us.
BETTER HOUSING IS A CORNERSTONE
Stuart Ropke, chief executive of Community Housing Cymru
"When the nation talks about health, inevitably the focus is always on acute services - A&E, admission to hospital, quality of GP services - which are of course really important, but for me there are obvious building blocks which need to be in place so people don't reach that stage.
"For me, housing is the keystone of good health. At the very basic level, the fabric of the home providing warmth and protection from the elements but also the community where people live is really important to their well being.
"It's not just about delivering physical homes on the ground but ensuring the people living there are healthy, active and being supported."
So how do you do that?
On the site of the old Ely paper mill in Cardiff, 800 new homes will soon be built.
But the boss of the company responsible for this site tells me the Â£100m project is quite different to things done in the past, where developers tended to build homes, sell them and move on.
David Ward, chief executive of Tirion Group
"Fifty percent of this housing will be affordable homes and we're going to be here for 50 years, managing these homes. It's important we get the quality right for people renting. So from a public health point of view, we're offering good quality, well-managed homes, at a price people can afford."
A community engagement team will be working on projects with residents which range from the design of a riverside park to healthy living initiatives.
"We're looking at the allotments on the other side of the river and whether there's something we can do with the local community in delivering a food project and we're finishing the missing link of the Ely Trail which will connect all the way from Cardiff Bay to St Fagan's, which people cans use for walking, running and cycling but will also mean a commuter route to the centre of Cardiff."
PREVENTING BAD HEALTH AND A CULTURAL SHIFT IN THE PART WE ALL PLAY
But it is about much more than just housing, all public services have a part to play in trying to make sure we and future generations the best chance to be healthy and happy and prosperous.
But how do you get them all working together to achieve that goal?
Last year, a new law was passed in Wales - the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act - with the aim of doing just that. It was described as a world first.
The woman, charged with driving it, and advising, promoting and encouraging sustainable ways of working said it was about a cultural shift.
Quite simply if we carry on the way we are, our services are going to fall off a cliff
Sophie Howe, Wales' first future generations commissioner
"One of the most critical areas I think is a focus on prevention - a shift from just dealing with the here and now," she said.
"If you like, it's not parking our ambulance at the bottom of a cliff and waiting for them to fall over - but getting them on top of that cliff and making sure they don't fall in the first place."
"This is about a nurse thinking it's as much her responsibility to identify an issue of domestic abuse as a police officer," she added.
"It's incredibly tough but something we have got to do. Quite simply if we carry on the way we are, our services are going to fall off a cliff."
THE PUBLIC SERVICES BUDGET CONUNDRUM
Others, too, sense a risk.
In successive recent budgets, hundreds of millions of extra pounds have been pumped into the NHS, largely to help it cope with the pressure its under.
Yet other areas have been squeezed.
We have to be wary of the health service in terms of its funding mechanism, crowding out other services
Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association
"I pose this question: what do you want your public sector to be?
"If we carry on the same route, especially if austerity continues and deepens in this next period, the public sector will be schools and hospitals and very little else.
"The danger is you exclusively look at one part of the system and forget another part. We have to be wary of the health service in terms of its funding mechanism, crowding out other services.
"I'm hoping with the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, if the Welsh Government is serious about prevention, they will follow that philosophy through.
"Then you're going to have to start thinking about some of those services which stop people getting into hospital in the first place and you're going to have to think about properly funding them."
A WORLD PERSPECTIVE
Dr Piroska Ostlin, director of policy and governance for health and well-being at the World Health Organization (WHO), in Cardiff for a two-day public health conference, said: "The biggest challenge we have now is to address health inequities which are very closely related to social inequities.
"It has an economic side as well, it costs a lot of money. Health is a very expensive business but it's interesting we only spend only 2-3% on prevention and health promotion, the rest is curative care."
She said the Future Generation Act in Wales was a major forward-looking landmark which could be a model the rest of the world could use - but it needed to be implemented in Wales or there could be a rise in health problems.
"We know what the root causes of health inequalities are - bad housing, low education, low income, poverty - these factors cannot be controlled by the health sector, we need really the help of other sectors. We have to absolutely abandon the silo approach."
People understand the NHS is under more pressure than ever before.
And any opinion poll will tell you, it is top priority for voters.
But broadly speaking the NHS is there to help us when things go wrong.
The question is how do you prevent more of those things from going wrong in the first place.
Health is about so much more of course than the NHS. The challenge is about striking the balance.

article In a statement to the Ballymena Guardian, the members, who are all from the north Antrim area, said the move was in reaction to the treatment received by former MLA Daithí McKay.
Sinn Féin said it was "disappointed" at the resignations.
Mr McKay resigned earlier this month over claims he "coached" a blogger to give evidence to a Stormont inquiry.
He accepted his actions were "inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong".
One of the 18 to resign, Monica Digney, told the BBC that it was "not a decision we took lightly".
"I have been a republican all my life," the former councillor said. "I will die a republican. But, I don't have to be  a Sinn Féin republican.
"Because, what has happened recently is there seems to be some people who get protected and other people are left hung out to dry and Daithí McKay, unfortunately, is one of those that was left hung out to dry."
Ms Digney was the first Sinn Féin member to be elected to Ballymena Council.
Last week, the party announced it would replace Daithí McKay with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor Philip McGuigan.
Those who have resigned told the Ballymena Guardian it was "inconceivable" that they could remain in light of the way they believe Mr McKay was treated.
They also criticised what they called the "anointing" of his successor without, they claim, any meaningful consultation.
Paul Maguire, a member of Mid and East Antrim council, said he intended to sit as an independent.
He claimed others in the party were considering their positions and more resignations may follow.
In a statement, Sinn Féin said it was "disappointed at the decision of individuals in North Antrim to resign from the party following Daithí McKay's resignation as MLA".
The statement added: "Daithi McKay acknowledged that his contact with loyalist Jamie Bryson was inappropriate and wrong".
It said it had "consulted with party activists in the North Antrim area and, following approval by the party's Ard Chomhairle, Philip McGuigan was co-opted as an MLA for the constituency.
"Sinn Féin will continue to provide first-class representation for the people of North Antrim."

article The former Doctor Who companion is Nebula in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, which topped the North American box office in its debut weekend.
Its takings of $94m (Â£55.8m) set a record for a film opening in August.
The movie also stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista, while Bradley Cooper voices an alien racoon called Rocket.
Gillan, from Inverness, who played Amy Pond in Doctor Who, told the BBC News Scotland website: "This is my first villain - the first of many one would hope.
"I had to train in martial arts and work out four times a week to be able to handle the fight sequences with Zoe Saldana."
Gillan added: "I was aware of the Marvel films that had gone before, so I knew the standard would be high.
"And to play a villain in one of those was about the most exciting thing ever."
The actress had her head shaved before making her bid for the role of Nebula.
She said: "When I was asked to audition, I had to agree the shave my head before I could even get in the room.
"But that was fine with me, I was looking for something drastic."
For her performances in the film, Gillan was required to spend five hours in make up.
She said: "It was worth every second. And I got to watch films on my iPad while being turned blue."
Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called "Phase 2" project.
The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.
Gillan said: "I'd never heard of Guardians - like most of the general population.
"But that was exciting because it is new, we are establishing something, taking a risk and we get to be the first actors to ever play these roles in cinema. That's cool to me."

article Rusting pit wheels, towering over disused mine shafts and mountainous slag heaps, are now disguised beneath wild and rampant vegetation.
Even the light industry that replaced the coal mines is disappearing.
On the edge of town the local Samsonite factory, which closed in 2007, is forlorn and abandoned.
Its enormous factory floor is now home to squatters - they have replaced the workers whose jobs were transferred to Eastern Europe.
Five years on from the closure half of the 200 people who were made redundant are still unemployed.
To former worker Brigitte Petit the factory provided more than just a salary - it gave structure and life to her local community.
"We were like a family," she said. "We loved our work. And they made us believe it was a job for life."
"Today we feel abandoned, betrayed," Ms Petit said.
Amid such anger and despair the far right party of Marine Le Pen is finding record support.
Nowhere in France did Marine Le Pen perform better in the presidential election than in this region. This weekend she stands for the parliamentary seat - one of a handful of constituencies where her party, the National Front (FN), believes it can win.
"We want change," said one supporter who waited for a signed photograph of Ms Le Pen.
"No to Europe. We want to go back to the franc. We have been ripped off by the euro. We don't have the means to live any more. I had to cancel my car insurance to feed my children."
But scenting blood is Ms Le Pen's arch rival, Jean-Luc Melenchon, champion of the far left and leader of the Left Front.
He has descended on Henin-Beaumont to "shine a light," he said, "on the vampires of the National Front" and to snatch from them a seat that a month ago looked guaranteed.
The FN dismiss him as an outsider who has parachuted into Henin-Beaumont to satisfy his own ego.
"It's true, I am not from here," Mr Melenchon told me. "I am not from anywhere. I was born in North Africa. I have lived all over France, like many of the people in this country."
"Madame Le Pen represents a France that no longer exists. People who've lived forever in the same place, who can never accept people from the outside."
They divide bitterly on immigration and in recent weeks the battle has grown ugly.
The National Front's well-marshalled supporters have been busy and the billboards are re-pasted every day with images of Marine Le Pen.
This week a new flyer was being distributed among traders in the town.
It caricatured the far left leader as Hitler, sporting the moustache and a swastika and behind him the Nazi party slogan "Arbeit macht frei" ("Work makes you free"). Mr Melenchon has complained. The FN have denied any responsibility.
But while on many issues these two parties are firmly opposed to one another, on economic matters there are surprising parallels.
These are populist parties, inward-looking. They appeal to the suspicion in France that surrounds capitalism and the free market.
Both advocate a rise in the minimum wage. They are Eurosceptic, albeit in different ways. Mr Melenchon is not anti-Europe, but he does not think it is working for France. And both pledge protectionism, to defend French jobs from the "evils" of globalisation.
In the local party headquarters Marine Le Pen tells me she is amused by Mr Melenchon's challenge.
"I think he loves me," she laughed. "He follows me all around the country."
But she tells me I am wrong to draw parallels between her party and the Left Front. There are fundamental differences, she says.
"The extreme left remain 'internationaliste'," she said. "We are patriots. We believe in the French nation."
"Only the French people can guarantee their own prosperity, security, identity," Ms Le Pen said. "The far left is opposed to our brand of nationalism. They are not against Europe. Far from it, they want more Europe."
There are two rounds of the parliamentary election - and the decisive 17 June round follows a first-past-the-post system. Up to 10 candidates will stand in the first round this Sunday.
The frontrunners go through to the second round, which tends to become a two- or three-horse race.
There has been a longstanding agreement, particularly on the left, that candidates running third will stand aside to give a better placed candidate a clear run.
That could happen in Henin-Beaumont, where either the governing Socialists or Mr Melenchon will progress alone.
Nationally the first round will give a true picture of what level of support each party has.
Bruno Jeanbart, a pollster from OpinionWay, says he expects to see the Socialists win with a narrow majority - essential if President Francois Hollande is to force through his reform programme.
But the vote for the National Front, Mr Jeanbart said, could mark a turning point. Not least in its challenge to the party of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, the conservative UMP.
"Traditionally the (National Front) lost one-third of their votes between presidential and legislative elections," Mr Jeanbart said.
"If they perform well in this election it shows people are not only voting for Marine Le Pen, they are voting for the National Front itself. And they are voting for the far right, and its agenda, to become part of the mainstream."
On a personal level Ms Le Pen badly needs to capture Henin-Beaumont to capitalise on her recent success.
The polls do have her comfortably ahead for Sunday's first round vote. But she will be defeated a week later if the Socialists do decide step aside and endorse Mr Melenchon, in the decisive second round.

article England won the day-night Test - the first game in the three-match series - by an innings and 209 runs inside three days at Edgbaston.
West Indies have not won a Test in England for 17 years.
"Every time they have arrived in England, they seem to have got worse," Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special.
West Indies lost 19 wickets on Saturday to be bowled out for 168 and 137 in reply to England's 514-8 declared.
Their squad is without established stars Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy after a disagreement with Cricket West Indies over selection.
However, their decline from the all-conquering side of the 1980s can be traced back to the mid-1990s - they have not won a series away from home against a team other than Bangladesh and Zimbabwe since 1995.
"There are a lot of young players in the West Indies side and you need to give them time, but I find it difficult to think they can go on without any senior players," said Vaughan, who captained England in 51 of his 82 Tests.
"There is no one there to teach them. I really fear that this series could be one of the saddest for Test cricket."
England, who were rated as the worst team in the world in 1999, drew a three-Test series in West Indies as recently as 2015.
"I don't think this era of cricket is any different to any other era," said England coach Trevor Bayliss.
"There have always been strong teams and one or two that are struggling.
"West Indies are going through a rough time but 20, 40, 60 years ago there were other teams that were going through rough periods."
England captain Joe Root said West Indies' display should not detract from the performance of his side, who beat South Africa 3-1 in their previous Test series this summer.
"We talk about being ruthless," he said. "We played some really good cricket and it's important we look to back that up."
Jermaine Blackwood, who scored an unbeaten 79 off 76 in the first innings, was the only West Indies batsmen to pass 40 in a game in which England's Alastair Cook made 243 and Root 136.
West Indies skipper Jason Holder said: "We just weren't up for scratch.
"We lacked consistency when we bowled and we didn't put up any runs in either the first or the second innings.
"Each player has to look themselves in the mirror and see in what way they can improve.
"It's important for us to regroup. This series is not lost. It's important we don't drop our heads. Obviously I believe. I have to believe."
The day-night Test, the first to be held in the UK, was arranged partly to help England prepare for the Ashes, where they will meet Australia in a floodlit Test in Adelaide.
"To have a taste of it before the Ashes is important," said Root.
"The visuals of the ball, getting used to batting at different points in the day, there will be different challenges that lie ahead.
"But to play in that environment and to know what it's about is a good thing moving forward."

It added: "His case is being progressed in line with the immigration rules.
"Where someone has no right to remain in the UK, we will take action to remove them."
A statement from Selwood said: "A member of staff at the security gate alerted the police after the driver of a lorry which had stopped before entering the site raised concerns that there may be people in the vehicle.
"The lorry was due to make a delivery to Selwood.
"The matter was handled by the police and the lorry, which had been sent by a supplier from Germany, was taken onto the site at Chandler's Ford."

article Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it would be "totally wrong" for the visit to go ahead later this year.
A petition to stop it has reached over 300,000 meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.
The visit was announced during PM May's trip to the US - no date has been set.
Downing Street were asked for a response to the calls to cancel. A spokesman said: "We extended the invite and it was accepted."
Speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said:  "I think we should make it very clear we are extremely upset about it, and I think it would be totally wrong for him to be coming here while that situation is going on.
"I think he has to be challenged on this. I am not happy with him coming here until that ban is lifted, quite honestly."
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron backed the call. He said: "Any visit by President Trump to Britain should be on hold until his disgraceful ban comes to an end.
"Otherwise Theresa May would be placing the Queen in an impossible position of welcoming a man who is banning British citizens purely on grounds of their faith."
Alex Salmond, the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman, said he thought the state visit was "a very bad idea".
Also appearing on Sky News' Sophy Ridge, he said: "You shouldn't be rushing into a headlong relationship with the President of the United States."
Mr Salmond said reports Mr Trump was reluctant to meet Prince Charles during the visit were "an indication of the sort of enormous difficulties you get into when you hold somebody tight who is unpredictable, who has a range of views you find unacceptable."
And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the visit should not happen while the executive order was in place.
He told Sky News: "I am quite clear, this ban is cruel, this ban is shameful, while this ban is in place we should not be rolling out the red carpet for President Trump."
Graham Guest, who started the petition, said he wanted it to "put the spotlight" on Mr Trump.
He told the Press Association: "A state visit legitimises his presidency and he will use the photo opportunities and being seen with the Queen to get re-elected.
"The wording in the petition is quite precise as I actually say that he should come here as the head of government to do government-to-government business.
"At the end of the day he is still the president and we've just got to live with that. But there's no reason why he should get all the pomp and publicity of a state visit."
Former shadow cabinet member Chuka Umunna also backed the calls to cancel the trip.
"State visits happen at the instigation of governments and, of course, you have got a prime minister who you want to have a decent working relationship with a US president.
"But they need to understand, just as they will put America first, we will put British values first."
Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has questioned the state visit on Twitter.
He wrote: "Am I alone in finding it impossible to bear that in pursuit of her deeply wrong-headed policies our PM is now forcing THAT MAN on our Queen?"
Conservative MP for Totnes, Sarah Wollaston, earlier tweeted that the US President should not be invited to address the Houses of Parliament, saying Westminster Hall "should be reserved for leaders who have made an outstanding positive difference in the world".

article An estimated 131 freelancers could be offered staff contracts as a result, following a tax review by accountants Deloitte and BBC auditors.
However, the BBC said there is "no evidence" it used personal service companies to help aid tax avoidance.
It commissioned the report after a government review of tax paid by staff.
The Public Accounts Committee report said too many staff, in the government and the BBC, made their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less.
The report found that in total some 2,400 civil servants were subject to such "off-payroll" arrangements.
The review of the BBC's freelance contracting arrangements, published on Wednesday, covered all staff contracted and paid in the financial year 2011/12.
Deloitte and the internal auditors identified 804 freelance talent paid more than Â£50,000 that year that should be the subject of the BBC's new employment test as a matter of priority.
It is estimated 131 of these could be offered staff contracts when their current contracts expire.
The BBC said this new employment test will also now be carried out on any new staff, to help move away from the practice of engaging on-air talent on long term contracts as personal service companies, when a staff contract would be appropriate.
It is hoped the changes will be in place by the start of the new tax year in April 2013.
Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, welcomed the report, adding: "It is essential the public have confidence that publicly funded institutions have in place arrangements to ensure their staff pay the proper tax.
"The Government has introduced unprecedented levels of transparency into the tax arrangements of public sector workers paid off payroll. I hope when the BBC publish their new policy on freelancer engagement, it is equally as transparent."
The BBC admitted in the report that its current policy for contracting staff was "inconsistent".
The corporation added that this had resulted in on-air talent doing very similar work while being classified in a variety of ways; either as staff, self-employed or contracted through a personal service company.
"Our review shows the BBC is not using personal service companies to avoid tax or help others avoid tax," said Zarin Patel, the BBC's chief financial officer.
"Nevertheless, it shows inconsistencies in the way our policy has been applied. We are addressing this with a more objective employment test for all new contracts and by developing a new framework with HMRC for self-employed on-air presenters."
The BBC said it was making the changes to help address "the public perception that off-payroll contracts and in particular personal service companies are used to avoid tax".
It said retaining a freelance model was "critical" for the success of the BBC - and that staff would only be contracted via a personal service company when it was "absolutely satisfied" that was the most suitable method of employment.
Gerry Morrissey, general secretary of broadcasting union Bectu, said it was pleased with the results of the review.
The union, he said, "welcomes the Deloitte report's confirmation that the tax arrangements for the majority of freelances we represent are legitimate, and that these arrangements reflect their status as genuine freelances who work for multiple employers throughout the year".
"Furthermore we welcome any move to offer staff contracts to colleagues whose employment relationship with the BBC supports this."

article The Sherlock star condemned the "slow response" to the Syrian crisis during the curtain calls of Hamlet last year.
In a GQ interview, Cumberbatch said he has "very strong opinions" about "things that matter".
But he said he normally has to "wrench myself back" because, as a well-paid actor, he is portrayed as a hypocrite.
He told the magazine: "One of the arguments was, when are you going to put a refugee in your house or your flat?
"And, you know, I do have a house, but it's empty, it's gutted, there's no electricity or water, so that wouldn't work, and I have a baby in my flat, there are no spare rooms...
"I wasn't saying, 'Yes, open the doors to everyone, yes, give them our jobs and our wives', and that whole kind of stereotype fear that nationalism has leapt on."
Cumberbatch, who has a one-year-old son with his theatre director wife Sophie Hunter, is believed to have bought a Victorian house in north London.
He said he was prompted to make his speeches after seeing the photograph of dead toddler Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach that drew attention to the refugee crisis earlier this year.
Cumberbatch added: "It's not about privilege, it's about a child dead on a beach because he's tried to escape a war."
He continued: "I find it frustrating because I do have very strong opinions about things, and I do want to say things that matter, and that are important, and I have to wrench myself back.
"Because it's so easily framed by the right as 'Booo, who's he? He's a hypocrite, he's an actor, he's paid tonnes of money, who is he to tell us how to live our lives?'" he said.
Cumberbatch also hinted that we might have seen the last of hit BBC TV series Sherlock.
"It might be the end of an era. It feels like the end of an era, to be honest. It goes to a place where it will be pretty hard to follow on immediately.
"We never say never on the show. I'd love to revisit it, I'd love to keep revisiting it, I stand by that, but in the immediate future we all have things that we want to crack on with and we've made something very complete as it is, so I think we'll just wait and see. The idea of never playing him again is really galling."

article The 'no' majority hasn't kept them at bay.
I met one of them at Edinburgh University earlier this month.
To be clear, Carlo Cottarelli wasn't there to impose draconian conditions to a bail-out of Scotland's finances. Nor was he speaking on behalf of the IMF.
He was invited to explain how taxation and spending works in federal countries, having recently co-authored a study of 13 nation states where 'sub-national regions' have extensive powers - as with the American, Australian and Indian states, Canadian provinces and German lander.
They looked also at Austria and Spain, which aren't quite federal systems, but have elements of sharing taxation and government spending from which it's worth learning.
And while this academic tome was directed towards informing the hugely complex question of how the eurozone can co-ordinate its governments' finances better, it's not hard to see the implications for future fiscal relations between Holyrood and Westminster, if the Smith Commission is to be enacted.
Or rather, a close reading of it might indicate that there are bits of the Smith Commission that might be better not enacted, or at least re-thought, at a more careful pace.
The book, Designing a European Fiscal Union, published by Routledge, Â£88, takes some digesting.
For a more readable (and cheaper) guide to devolved tax, the Scottish Parliament's research service, SPICE, is worth a look.
It helps to put the changing position of Scotland's tax autonomy into some international perspective.
The conclusion of the IMF study is that there is no one way to skin the federal cat.
The share of tax raised by 'sub-national' regions ranges from 31% in Austria to 67% in Canada. Germany is at 39%; the USA at 60%.
But if you take out shared taxes, over which the sub-national region has limited control, the picture is different. Only Canada, the US and Switzerland are above a third.  In Austria, Germany and Mexico, it's under 10%.
The study calculates a transfer dependency, a measure of how much sharing and pooling of resources goes on within each country, and that also ranges widely.
It accounts for 88% of regional spend in Mexico, 16% in Canada, and 18% in the US. Among countries more similar to the UK, figures include Austria 45%, Belgium 64%, Germany 54% and Spain 50%.
The IMF economists show that systems are, of course, shaped by the history of how countries were drawn together.
They can be changed - as is the case with the eurozone - by the often bruising experience of shocks for which their rules were not prepared.
And they depend on one commodity that is not immediately evident from the current state of Holyrood-Westminster relations: a mutual desire for co-operation and stability. That is, you can get systems that work, but all sides have to buy into them and must want to make them work.
What these arrangements require are fiscal rules, recognised by both sides. The obvious ones are around the scale of deficits and debts.
And if two governments have a different approach to taxing, spending and cutting their way out of recession - as between the Westminster coalition and the Scottish government in recent years - then there's an obvious problem.
For those who break the rules, there have to be meaningful sanctions. And as the eurozone has found (it didn't take a genius to see this problem coming), countries that run rule-breaking deficits are not well placed to pay big fines as a penalty for doing so - not without borrowing more and running a bigger deficit.
Achieving flexibility and consistency is a tricky balancing act. Co-ordinating across the economic cycle, and applying that famous economic stabiliser, requires thinking in advance of the point when the downturn hits home.
There's a long history of ad hoc arrangements being put in place when there are such crises. Together, they offer some worthwhile lessons for those trying to plan ahead for a robust system.
And there's borrowing: when should it be allowed, to what extent, by what means, who carries the risk, how much should a central government signal its willingness or unwillingness to leave its smaller partner hanging out to dry in the bond markets?
A crucial part of any federal system is the extent to which it shares risks and transfers money from the rich to the poor, from the buoyant to those fallen on relatively harder times.
All of these issues require inter-government bodies to negotiate the share-out of powers, inter-government grants, the application of rules and borrowing quotas. Both or all sides have to be politically committed to these bodies.
We're yet to see the machinery that the UK Treasury sets up which gives devolved administrations some parity of esteem in such negotiations, as the IMF indicate you ought to be able to find in Belgium, Mexico, Argentina and the USA.
That will, or would, be a big challenge to the culture and the sovereign will of Treasury ministers and mandarins. The Barnett Formula has, for 36 years, been a way of avoiding such discussions.
The IMF survey found that the answer is typically through income tax. And that is a bit of a problem, because income tax is the main pillar on which the Smith Commission built its further devolution of powers to Holyrood.
If the Scottish Parliament is to depend on buoyant income tax take, it is going to have to have very much sounder data on which to base its forecasting.
And that income tax departure from the federalised norm is a reminder that the Smith Commission seems to be based on very little assessment of what doesn't work elsewhere, before committing to what it thinks will work.
This may become clearer today as we get the draft clauses of the legislation being built on the Smith Commission foundations.
One aspect of those plans that grabbed the attention of academics discussing the IMF study with Sr Cottarelli is something called the 'no detriment' principle. It's significant because the expert in these federal systems knew of no other country which has it.
It's in the Smith Commission report, page nine, section seven, subsection five, and it goes like this: "The package of powers agreed through the Smith Commission process, when taken together, should not cause detriment to the UK as a whole nor to any of its constituent parts".
It goes on to say the further devolution should cause "neither the UK Government nor the Scottish Government to gain or lose financially simply as a consequence of devolving a specific power".
I'm hazarding a guess that you'll probably hear more about this, because if it's interpreted literally, it means that the use of any tax power which gets an advantage over another part of the UK requires compensation to the disadvantaged side.
Whatever one side gains, to the disadvantage of the other, it has to refund.
That looks fiendishly difficult to calculate in a way that either side of such negotiations could agree upon, as the impact could be felt over many years.
And whether it's designed to look this way or not, the implication is that a lot of policy divergence would be rendered pointless. And if you can't diverge policy to make a difference, why bother having the power?
Indeed, this problem is already being seen in the assumptions being made about the devolution of stamp duty to Holyrood, and the impact that has on the Scottish block grant.
We've seen problems and anomalies arise around this sort of thing before - for instance, when the funding of English students diverged from Scotland's, when water boards were privatised but not in Scotland, and when free personal care in Scotland didn't align with the UK-wide attendance allowance.
To return to the debate before 18 September 2014, would independence avoid such difficult circumstances? Possibly. But remember the need for negotiations to share the pound sterling as the continuing currency for Scotland?
A lot of the challenges facing federal systems would crop up in these talks too. The book is, after all, about the choices facing independent countries which share the euro.

article More than 2,000 guests from around the world paid their last respects at the biggest such occasion since the Queen Mother's funeral in 2002.
Thousands of members of the public and the armed forces lined the funeral procession route through London.
PM David Cameron said it was a "fitting tribute" to a major figure.
Four thousand police officers were on duty in central London but, despite concerns about demonstrations, only a small number of protesters voiced their opposition to Lady Thatcher's policies and there were no arrests.
Elsewhere, around the country:
The congregation at St Paul's included Lady Thatcher's family and all surviving British prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, the current cabinet and surviving members of Lady Thatcher's governments.
There were tears, and occasional laughter, as the Bishop of London, the Right Reverend Richard Chartres, paid tribute to Lady Thatcher's forthright character in a simple service, which, at her personal request, did not include any eulogies.
"After the storm of a life led in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm," said Bishop Chartres.
"The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher who became a symbolic figure - even an ism.
"Today the remains of the real Margaret Hilda Thatcher are here at her funeral service.
"Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all human beings."
Chancellor George Osborne appeared to wipe away a tear as the bishop reflected on Lady Thatcher's life.
The day began with Lady Thatcher leaving Parliament for the last time as a hearse took her body from the crypt chapel of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster to the start of the military procession at St Clement Danes in The Strand.
The union jack draped-coffin was topped with a large bunch of white flowers and a note, by Lady Thatcher's children Sir Mark and Carol, reading: "Beloved mother, always in our hearts."
A gun carriage drawn by six black horses carried the coffin through the streets to St Paul's, where the funeral service began with readings from the King James Bible by Mr Cameron and Lady Thatcher's 19-year-old granddaughter Amanda, and hymns chosen by the former prime minister.
By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor
The service ended with a blessing from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.
Lady Thatcher's coffin was borne out of the cathedral and returned to a hearse which took it to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and then to Mortlake Crematorium in south west London for a private cremation.
Lady Thatcher, who was Conservative Prime Minister from 1979 until 1990, died on 8 April, following a stroke, at the age of 87.
She was accorded a ceremonial funeral with military honours, one step down from a state funeral.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Cameron said it would have been seen as extraordinary not to commemorate her life.
Asked about those who wanted to challenge his view of Lady Thatcher, the prime minister said:  "Of course people have the right to disagree and take a different view.
"But when you're mourning the passing of an 87-year-old woman who was the first woman prime minister, who served for longer in the job than anyone for 150 years I think it's appropriate to show respect."
There were more than 50 guests associated with the Falkland Islands, including veterans from the 1982 conflict with Argentina, but Argentina's ambassador to London, Alicia Castro declined an invitation to attend.
Alan Southern, a former member of the Parachute Regiment who fought in the Falklands War, said: "Lady Thatcher was an absolutely wonderful lady. She loved the armed forces and she did so much for the country, she put the 'great' back in Great Britain."
In total, two current heads of state, 11 serving prime ministers and 17 serving foreign ministers from around the world attended.
Notable absences were former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who could not attend because of ill health, and former US first lady Nancy Reagan, who was also unable to come.
Six police forces from outside London sent specialist officers to help with escorting foreign dignitaries.
There were union jacks on display, as well as flags from the US, Canada, Scotland, Poland and the Falkland Islands.
St Paul's has published a full funeral order of service.

article The tumour originated in a single dog 11,000 years ago but outlived its host by transferring to another dog - and is still on the march today.
An international team led by Cambridge scientists mapped its progress based on DNA from 449 tumours in 39 countries.
Some of the cancer's more recent travel between continents, they found, aligns with maritime trade routes.
But apart from reflecting the shared migration history of dogs and humans, the tumour's genetic history includes a surprising quantity of DNA pilfered from its hosts.
The findings, reported in the open access journal eLife, are based on mitochondrial DNA - small, circular chains of genetic information parcelled up in mitochondria, the "batteries" of cells.
And the study centres on a rare but recurring event: at least five times during the tumour's poisonous coexistence with millions of dogs through the ages, it appears to have traded mitochondrial DNA with its host.
"Normally the dog is a transient host - and then the tumour gets passed on to more dogs. But what has happened occasionally is that DNA from the dog actually enters the tumour cell," explained Dr Elizabeth Murchison, a Wellcome Trust Investigator at the University of Cambridge and the paper's senior author.
"So rather than carrying the mitochondria of the original dog that lived 11,000 years ago, the tumour is now carrying the host dog's mitochondria. And it's going to pass those on to the next dog."
Those five wholesale transfer events create five major ancestral groups or "clades" for the tumours that exist today. By further analysing the  gradual, piecemeal mutations that accumulate during the rest of the cancer's history, Dr Murchison and her colleagues built up a family tree and a clear picture of the disease's journey around the planet.
Known as canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT), the cancer can affect any breed of dog and is usually found in the animal's genitals. From there it is easily transmitted during sex, and is currently found in dogs on six continents.
It is one of just a handful of infectious cancers known to science, including the face tumour threatening Tasmanian devils with extinction.
Because all CTVT cells can be traced back to a single dog some 11 millennia in the past, it is regarded as the oldest and most prolific cancer lineage in nature.
A previous study showed that the tumour was able to steal DNA from its host dogs.
Dr Murchison, working with a large international team, conducted a thorough search for such genetic thievery.
"Every time the DNA from the host dog has been picked up, that acts as a little genetic flag for us," she told the BBC.
One such event, dated to about 500 years ago, spawned cancerous progeny in a tell-tale, transcontinental pattern.
"We were able to estimate the time since the mitochondrial transfer events, by counting the number of mutations. And one of them really seems to just track around maritime trade routes, in the last few hundred years.
"We found it along the coast of West Africa, in the Cape Verde islands, Brazil, South Africa, India, and some parts of southern Europe.
"You can kind of imagine those dogs on boats, which must have taken that tumour around with them."
For the geneticists involved, the highlight of this large study was a cancerous specimen from Nicaragua which showed something never seen before: not only had the tumour pinched some mitochondrial DNA from its canine host, but the two sequences had been spliced together.
This "recombination" is a routine part of how the regular DNA in our chromosomes gets jostled around - but evidence of it happening in mitochondria is rare and controversial. Many researchers "still don't really believe" it is possible, Dr Murchison said.
And it has never been seen in the mitochondria of a cancer cell.
"Mitochondrial DNA recombination could be happening on a much wider scale, including in human cancers, but it may usually be very difficult to detect," said MÃ¡ire NÃ­ Leathlobhair, co-first author of the study.
"In human cancer, the tumour's mitochondrial DNA is likely to be very similar to the mitochondrial DNA in the patient's normal cells, so the result of recombination would be almost impossible to recognise."

article Does the Chinese economy appear to be stronger or weaker than previously thought?
Where is steel production?
What about the explosion in service industries?
Of course there are the international implications: What do the numbers mean for other economies?
Will Asia's powerhouse look to buy greater volumes Australian iron ore?
Could a growing consumer sector mean more tourists heading to France or Vanuatu?
Then we have to remind ourselvesâ€¦ hang on!
Plenty of economists think that GDP is a massively flawed form of measuring the health of any economy but in this country it is even worse.
There is significant proportion of China watchers who don't believe the GDP figures are real at all.
For example, in 2016, the country's (year-on-year) GDP growth was exactly 6.7% for three quarters in a row.
While this seems numerically unlikely, I suppose it is possible that this could happen.
Yet suspicion regarding growth statistics in the Middle Kingdom is not a new phenomenon.
For years, some provinces are thought to have been artificially inflating their numbers in order to create an appearance of improved economic performance on the part of their local leaders.
Others may have underestimated their growth so as to attract more favours from the national government.
In 2012, when you added the GDP of all provinces together this came to a greater number than the national total.
Now, for the first time, we have official confirmation that GDP here has been fabricated.
According to the Governor of Liaoning, Chen Qiufa, his province has been "involved in a large-scale financial deception" from 2011 to 2014. He said that fake data from city and county level officials misled the central government about the area's economy.
His announcement was made a meeting of the local legislature giving it even more gravitas.
If China's GDP is not to be trusted then how to judge this country's economic health?
Some analysts turn to electricity consumption or seaborne cargo believing that these are actual measurable indicators of activity expanding or contracting.
Other potential yardsticks could include building construction per square metre or domestic freight volumes.
Using these measures there are those who think that, in recent years, China's actual GDP growth should have dropped much more dramatically from 8% down to more like around 4% rather than just below 7%.
However without solid, reliable figures this remains a debate with wide-ranging, conflicting views.
Mind you, even if at worse China's real GDP growth is around 4% at present, there are plenty of national governments which wouldn't mind a taste of those numbers.
summary The Chinese economy is a hot topic, with many questions being asked.

article Rs defender James Perch was sent-off before half-time for two yellow cards, and Dave Edwards fired in from 10 yards on the hour to put Wolves ahead.
Helder Costa then cut in from the right to double the lead.
Joel Lynch pulled one back from close range and then missed a glorious chance to equalise as Wolves held on.
That miss - an airshot five yards out - came in eight frantic minutes of stoppage time when play swung from one end to the other as QPR searched for an equaliser and Wolves looked to hit them on the break.
Costa, twice, and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson were both brilliantly denied by Rangers keeper Alex Smithies as Wolves looked for the third goal that would have settled the contest.
The finale was in contrast to the first half in which Smithies again saved from Costa before Perch was dismissed after being booked first for dissent and then for a late tackle on Matt Doherty.
QPR's 10 men began the second half brightly but fell behind when Edwards shot into the top corner from Dominic Iorfa's pull-back before Costa made it 2-0.
Another smart Smithies save from Doherty kept the Rs in the game and they were rewarded when Lynch reduced the arrears.
But Wolves, whose keeper Carl Ikeme pulled up with an apparent Achilles injury when taking a second-half goal kick, held on to secure their first victory since beating Brentford on 24 September and move three points clear of the relegation zone in 19th.
Wolves manager Paul Lambert told BBC WM 95.6:
"I thought we earned the right to win the game with the start we had, and we had one or two chances before the sending off against a team that's really difficult to play against here.
"There was more enthusiasm for the game, more intensity for the game, we looked more of a threat and I think we look stronger defensively.
"I still think we can be better in a lot of aspects, but it's a decent start and I think we're playing pretty well at the minute."
QPR boss Ian Holloway on James Perch's sending-off:
"It's probably the most bizarre thing I seen for a while. I thought the decisions (referee Tim Robinson) made in the first few minutes led to the first booking. He blew everything up and that set the game up.
"I think he has made a mistake, Perchy then made a mistake on his second challenge, he caught him. My player shouldn't have (gone in on the challenge) for the second one, the referee shouldn't have booked him for the first one.
"The ref said he spoke to him in an 'aggressive manner', which is that stupid newfangled rule. He said 'ref he dropped it', there was no swearing. If there was swearing I could understand."

article The Democratic Unionist Party MP backs a British exit, or a so-called Brexit.
He claimed the annual block grant would likely benefit from the UK saving on its financial contribution to Europe.
He said Northern Ireland would in theory be entitled to 3% (£540m) of the £18bn that the UK pays into Europe as a result of the Barnett Formula.
The formula is used by the Treasury to allocate public spending in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The DUP has yet to formally adopt a position ahead of a referendum on EU membership.
Mr Wilson accepts, however, that it will be for the government to decide how it uses any saving, should voters back withdrawal.
"If it wants to use it to help write off the deficit there will be no Barnett consequential," he said.
"It is a decision for them."
The UK pays more into the EU kitty than it gets back, but Northern Ireland has been a major beneficiary of that returned funding.
Northern Ireland's business community broadly favours the UK remaining in the EU.
Last year, research for the Northern Ireland Assembly said leaving the EU could cost the Northern Ireland economy almost £1bn a year.
It pointed to £2.4bn of EU funding which was received in the region between 2007 and 2013.

Bagpuss Shaun will be on display at Cabot Circus and Mr Hemingway's Sheepish at Temple Church Gardens.
The trail, featuring 70 statues, starts on 6 July and ends on 31 August.
It is the first time Peter Firmin and his daughter Emily, an artist and sculptor, have worked together. Ms Firmin also played the part of "Emily" - the daughter of Bagpuss's owner - in the 1970s children's TV series, when she was eight years old.
Mr Firmin said: "Emily helped me work out how to paint such a large sculpture, and helped paint the legs, as I found it difficult at my age to bend down to reach them."
Hemingway, who created fashion label Red or Dead, said designing the sculpture had been a "blast".
The statues will be auctioned later this year to raise funds for Bristol Children's Hospital's Grand Appeal.
A previous trail in Bristol in 2013, based on another Aardman character, Gromit, raised Â£4.5m for sick children after the sculptures were auctioned.

article Women will be able to use it to pay for anything from one-to-one midwifery care to home births, the use of birthing pools and hypnotherapy.
The move is part of a shake-up in maternity care unveiled by NHS England to increase the choices women have.
The overhaul is also aimed at improving safety in maternity services.
It has been agreed to on the basis of recommendations from an independent review of services.
This was set up by NHS England in the aftermath of the inquiry published last year into the failures that led to the deaths of babies at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust.
The review - chaired by Conservative peer Baroness Julia Cumberlege - said it had never been safer to give birth in England, but improvements still needed to be made to ensure care was "world class".
The review's report said that while the numbers of still births and deaths shortly after birth had fallen by over a fifth in the past decade, about one in 17 births resulted in some level of harm.
It also highlighted the £560m spent each year by the NHS on clinical negligence cases relating to maternity care.
The review took evidence from thousands of families about their experience of maternity care and found they "did not always have confidence" that complications would be picked up or problems investigated properly.
To improve care, the review has called for:
Women also complained about the lack of choice they were given, despite existing policy stating they should be able to choose where they give birth.
Nearly nine in 10 women give birth in hospital, but just one in four says this is where she would want to have a baby.
The review team felt personal budgets, already used by the elderly, disabled and those with long-term conditions such as heart disease, would help empower women.
The system, to be piloted later this year before a national rollout in 2017, would give women a notional budget they could then use on whichever NHS-accredited services they liked.
These could include:
The review authors said low-risk, standard births cost the NHS about £3,000, so women could expect that sum at the very least.
Baroness Cumberlege said: "To be among the best in the world, we need to put women, babies and their families at the centre of their care."
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said the review had set out a five-year strategy which the health service could now work towards.
"The NHS could and should raise its game on personalised support for parents and their babies," he said.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the publication of the review was a "significant moment" and would give women more choice and make services safer.
Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said she was "delighted" with the plans, but warned more midwives would be needed to deliver the ambitions.
There are currently 21,500 working in the NHS, but the college believes another 2,600 are needed.

article Mr Gulen, a former ally of the prime minister, has been accused by Mr Erdogan of using his supporters to try to topple him.
The cleric denies mounting a campaign against him.
Turkey's government has faced a string of corruption scandals and rights groups accuse it of authoritarianism.
Speaking at parliament after meeting with deputies from his Justice and Development Party (AKP) party on Tuesday, Mr Erdogan confirmed the extradition process "will begin", reports say.
The Turkish PM was speaking hours after an interview with US broadcaster PBS, in which he said he hoped the US would deport Mr Gulen and send him back to Turkey.
It was his first interview with foreign media since his party claimed victory in local elections last month.
Gulen: Powerful but reclusive
Profile: Hizmet movement
In the interview, Mr Erdogan said he hoped Washington, as a "model partner", would deliver on the issue.
"At least they should deport him," he added.
Mr Gulen, 74, has lived in self-imposed exile in the US state of Pennsylvania since 1997.
He has many supporters in the police and judiciary, and has denounced moves to shut down an investigation into corruption allegations levelled against several of the prime minister's allies.
His teachings have inspired the Hizmet ("Service") movement, which is believed to have millions of followers spread across over 150 countries.
Hizmet promotes a tolerant form of Islam, emphasising education, altruism and hard work.
Mr Erdogan has accused the movement of being behind a series of wiretaps and social media leaks allegedly exposing major corruption of figures with ties to the government.
Thousands of alleged Hizmet sympathisers in the police and judiciary have since been demoted or reassigned to other jobs.
Over the past year, Turkey has been convulsed by mass protests against Mr Erdogan's ten-year rule and the corruption allegations.

article The rainbow flags with the Jewish symbol "made people feel unsafe", an organiser told the Windy City Times.
Laurel Grauer said she was told to leave the so-called Dyke March "because my flag was a trigger to people that they found offensive".
The organisers later hit back, saying Israel hides behind LGBT-rights.
"It was a flag from my congregation which celebrates my queer, Jewish identity which I have done for over a decade marching in the Dyke March with the same flag," Ms Grauer told Windy City Times.
Ms Grauer, who works for A Wider Bridge, which supports LGBT people in Israel, said she lost count of how many times she was verbally harassed by other marchers on Saturday.
The Dyke March takes place one day ahead of the city's official Pride March.
It is described by organisers as being a "more inclusive, more social justice-oriented" march than the city's main Pride parade.
In a social media post, the Dyke March said: "This decision was made after [the expelled marchers] repeatedly expressed support for Zionism during conversations with Dyke March Collective members."
Ms Grauer told the Times: "People asked me if I was a Zionist and I said, 'yes, I do care about the state of Israel, but I also believe in a two-state solution and an independent Palestine.'
"It's hard to swallow the idea of inclusion when you are excluding people from that," she continued.
"People are saying, 'You can be gay but not in this way.' We do not feel welcomed. We do not feel included."
In a statement, the Dyke March Collective later accused Ms Grauer's organistion of "using Israel's supposed 'LGBTQ tolerance' to pinkwash the violent occupation of Palestine".
A Wider Bridge hit back in a statement, saying: "That the organisers would choose to dismiss long-time community members for choosing to express their Jewish identity or spirituality runs counter to the very values the Dyke March claims to uphold, and veers down a dangerous path toward anti-Semitism."
They called upon the Dyke March Collective to issue a full apology.
Red State, a conservative blog, wrote: "When you're the organizer of a gay pride parade meant to celebrate 'inclusiveness,' then you're not just engaging in bigotry and anti-Semitism, but you're saying to the world you're also a giant hypocrite."

article The 10 organisations which make up the award jury said she was courageous and faced harassment because of her work.
Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda, and can be punished by long jail terms.
In January, her colleague David Kato was murdered not long after suing a paper that outed them both as gay. Police denied the killing was because of his sexuality.
Three months before the murder, Uganda's Rolling Stone newspaper published the photographs of several people it said were gay, including activist Mr Kato, with the headline "Hang them."
The name of Ms Nabagesera, the founder of gay rights organisation Freedom and Roam Uganda, also appeared on the list.
The Geneva-based award jury said Ms Nabagesera had appeared on national television and issued press statements on behalf of Uganda's gay community.
However, because of threats and harassment she now shifted "from house to house, afraid to stay long in the same place", their statement said.
"[She is] an exceptional woman of a rare courage, fighting under death threat for human dignity and the rights of homosexuals and marginalised people in Africa," jury chairman Hans Thoolen said.
In October 2009, an MP introduced a bill that proposed increasing the penalties in Uganda for homosexual acts from 14 years in prison to life.
It also proposed the death penalty for a new offence of "aggravated homosexuality" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a "serial offender".
The Anti-Homosexuality Bill is yet to be formally debated by the Ugandan parliament.
The Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders is named after the late British lawyer who became the first head of the human rights organisation Amnesty International.

article After Wednesday's Fernando Forestieri had seen a goal ruled out for offside, Ross Wallace scored from 25 yards.
The visitors lost four players to injuries, including top scorer Tomer Hemed and winger Anthony Knockaert.
With Brighton down with 10 men, Kieran Lee slotted in a second to stretch the Owls' lead before Monday's second leg.
Centre-back Connor Goldson and midfielder Steve Sidwell also left the field prematurely as the Seagulls, who narrowly missed out on automatic promotion by drawing at Middlesbrough on the final day of the season, saw their 14-game unbeaten run come to an end.
Hemed had already headed against the post for Brighton during a frenetic start before the biggest talking point of the first half.
Forestieri, standing several yards offside when goalkeeper Keiren Westwood cleared upfield, fired in low past Brighton's David Stockdale for what he thought was the opening goal.
The home side were convinced that Gary Hooper had flicked the ball onto Forestieri - who by then had got himself into an onside position - but their protests were waved away by referee Andre Marriner, who consulted with his officials before deciding to disallow the goal.
Wednesday, in particular head coach Carlos Carvalhal, were incensed by the decision, which was later proved to be correct by television replays.
Wednesday had only lost twice in the league at Hillsborough all season and Brighton's chances of a positive first-leg result in South Yorkshire were severely hampered by the loss of four key men to injuries.
Already without defender Lewis Dunk and Dale Stephens because of suspension, as well as injured veteran striker Bobby Zamora, manager Chris Hughton was forced into two first-half substitutions when Goldson and Hemed left the field within 30 seconds of each other.
Sidwell followed soon after the interval and Brighton were faced with the prospect of playing the final 30 minutes with 10 men when Knockaert had to be carried from the field on a stretcher.
Dunk will return from his ban for the second leg, which a depleted Brighton will enter needing to overturn a two-goal deficit to reach the play-off final at Wembley on 28 May.
Chris Waddle, ex-Sheffield Wednesday winger on BBC Radio 5 live
"This game's not finished. Sheffield Wednesday could have put it to bed. Give Brighton credit, they've had a horrendous night with injuries and everything's been against them.
"I thought Sheffield Wednesday were excellent in spells tonight. I just hope they don't regret killing this game by three or four."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: "I think we did one of our best performances of the season and if you exclude a moment when Brighton had a chance early on, I think we played very well.
"We are happy about the game and the score but we know we have won absolutely nothing - we have the advantage but we must understand that we can't play thinking we are winning 2-0.
"The game will start at 0-0 and we will do our best to get a good result at Brighton."

Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "The injuries were all substantial enough to go off and not one of them wanted to go off. At the moment I wouldn't be too optimistic about all four of them.
"I've never been involved in a game like that. We've gone through a decent period with injuries after a really tough period in the first half of the season, and whether it's the consistent games and the tempo we've had to play at in the last few weeks, I don't know.
"We have to be realistic enough to know it's going to be a tough task, but it is something that can be achieved."

article The lovelorn ballad only reached number 108, but it set the "dirt poor" Tennessee singer on the path to fame.
Since then, she's sold more than 100 million albums, topped the country chart 25 times, and won eight Grammy Awards - but she shows no signs of slowing down.
"Almost every day I come up with a few song titles or a sweet melody," says the 70-year-old, who claims to have written more than 3,000 songs in her career.
Her latest album, Pure & Simple, came out on Friday, featuring new songs with stripped-down arrangements that recall the early days of her career.
It has an overwhelmingly romantic theme, inspired by renewing her wedding vows earlier this year. And just like her chart career, her marriage to Carl Dean turned 50 this year.
"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs," she says. "I've never done that before. I've usually had a story song or a gospel song, but this was all love stories."
The BBC caught up with the star to discuss the new record, her legendary Glastonbury set, and why she admires Adele.
First of all, congratulations on celebrating your golden wedding anniversary!
Thank you so much. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? Especially to be married.
What's the secret?
We've always been good buddies. We have a lot of fun and a lot of respect for one another. It was his first marriage and mine and we never thought we'd ever want to do that again. Why bother?
You renewed your vows earlier this year. What was that like?
That was sweet. There was no pressure at all. We had our own little ceremony in a little chapel on our property, then we went in our little RV down to Ringgold, Georgia, and spent the night where we had married 50 years before. We took some beautiful pictures and got all dressed up. It was fun really.
Did you wear your original wedding dress? Could you still fit into it?
Well, I could but I don't know where it is now! I only had a simple little white dress that my mother had made for me for that wedding, but I had always wanted a beautiful, long, beaded wedding gown, so I dressed completely to the nines. I made a right nice bride!
That sense of romance permeates your new album.
Oh yes! In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that.
You've written so many love songs over the years - how do you find new ways to talk about it?
Love is always growing, and we grow as people as well, so you just automatically take on new twists and turns. And it's amazing. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. I could write one right now!
How often do you write?
I write something almost every single day unless I'm sick or on a movie set.
Is that ever an inconvenience? Do you ever find yourself going, "I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?"
Well, no! In fact, I write a lot when I cook. If my cooking's really good that day, my songs are really good.
In Head Over High Heels, you sing about "painting my eyes like Adele." What made you write about her?
Everyone loves Adele. With all my little nieces, it's all "Adele this" and "Adele that!" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, "can you fix my eyes like Adele?"
When I started that song, I had not planned to write that line. I was just thinking, "This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes". And all of a sudden it's like, "And my eyes like Adele!"
What do you think her reaction will be?
I think she'll have to be complimented, just like I'm always complimented when people write songs about me!
I just meant I wanted to look like Adele. I hope she thinks it's cute.
You both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than youâ€¦ I wondered what you made of that?
Oh, I don't pay any attention to that! Words are just an exchange, like money. I don't think the Lord holds that against us. I think that's just the way we communicate. And some people are just born cussers.
What's the worst thing you've ever said on stage?
Oh, I've never said anything real bad. I try to respect the audience.
The song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right?
Yeah, she had a couple of bad relationships and she thought it wasn't meant for her to have true love. Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. It's just the sweetest thing.
Another one of my sisters and I were laughing. We said, "Look at her, she thinks she's 16!" and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head.
Goes to show you're never old unless you choose to be.
What age do you think of yourself as?
I'm 16 in some ways. I'm still a hopeless romantic! But I'm 35 in my spirit and in my mind. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided "I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind."
What inspired Can't Be That Wrong?
That was an easy one to write. I think it's the ultimate cheating song.
I based it on someone very, very close to me, who was very much in love with the person at home, and their children, and they weren't looking for love, they just happened to fall for someone. They were so torn, because they loved both people. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, "That's a strong-ass love, right there". You know, to be willing to go through all you have to, and put the other people through that. So I thought, "wow, this would make a great song."
The last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. What are your memories of it?
That'll be one of my greatest memories, actually. That'll be a real highlight in my career.
I wasn't even certain about doing that show, because I didn't know if I was the type of artist that would fit in that type of a festival - because people are rowdy, they like to go dancing, and they like to drink and smoke and I thought, "I wonder if they're even going to pay attention?"
And so, as soon as I went out and I saw the crowd and heard the roar, I thought, "Ohhhh, my Lord, how did I miss this all these years?"
They call that part of the day the "legends slot". If you were booking next year's Glastonbury, who would you put in there?
I don't know. I hadn't even thought about it in those terms. Probably Adele.
But I'm not sure I'd do it again, because I don't know how I could ever top that.

article The latest blast took place at an apartment block at 08:00 local time (00:00 GMT) in Liucheng county, said state media.
Seventeen separate parcel explosions hit Liucheng on Wednesday.
A man suspected of having built the bombs - 33-year-old Wei Yinyong - died in one of the blasts, media said.
Earlier reports said a suspect had been arrested.
The cause for Thursday's blast was not clear, and no casualties have been reported. It is also not known if the blast is connected to the multiple explosions on Wednesday.
Thursday's explosion took place at a six-storey building in a residential area. Xinhua news agency said the force of the blast had caused debris to rain down on a road opposite the building.
Local police issued a statement calling on the public to be wary of accepting parcels sent by strangers or packages "sent by non-proper channels".
The local postal service has halted all deliveries until Saturday.
The parcel bombs on Wednesday targeted a prison, a railway station, a hospital and a shopping centre among other locations.
State media said 51 people were injured in the afternoon's blasts.
A video reportedly of one of Wednesday's blasts taken from a street surveillance camera has since emerged, showing a person being catapulted out of a shop as a bomb goes off inside. Another person walking down the street past the shop is knocked to the ground by the powerful blast.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says there have been a number of cases in China of disaffected people with a legal grievance against the authorities using explosive devices in public attacks.

article The site said hundreds of clips of Anwar al-Awlaki's calls to jihad violated a ban on hate speech and incitement to violence.
The move came less than a week after authorities intercepted air cargo bombs sent from Yemen to the US in a plot linked to Mr Awlaki.
The US has named Mr Awlaki a "specially designated global terrorist".
Investigators have linked Mr Awlaki to the US army base killings in Fort Hood, Texas, last year's Christmas airline bomb attempt, and the failed Times Square bombing in New York.
US officials say he is a leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot of the militant network based in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
A YouTube spokeswoman said the company tried to balance its commitment to free speech with the need to prevent calls to violence.
"These are difficult issues," the spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to the BBC, "and material that is brought to our attention is reviewed carefully.
"We will continue to remove all content that incites violence according to our policies. Material of a purely religious nature will remain on the site."
Last month, investigators working for New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, a Democrat, reported finding more than 700 videos in which Mr Awlaki appeared. The clips had garnered more than 3.5m hits.
Mr Weiner said there was no reason why Awlaki and others should be given "access to one of the world's largest bully pulpits so they can inspire more violent acts within our borders, or anywhere else in the world".
UK Security minister Baroness Neville-Jones is said recently to have told Washington officials that American websites hosting al-Qaeda videos inciting murder would be banned in the UK.
'Sermons inspired'
Mr Awlaki, an American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, is said to be on a CIA hit list authorised by President Barack Obama. In July, the US Treasury Department put Mr Awlaki on its terrorism blacklist and imposed financial sanctions on him.
US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009.
Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting last year, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say.
A student found guilty of attempting to murder MP Stephen Timms in east London was said to have been inspired by Mr Awlaki's online sermons.

article Mr McGuigan has been selected for co-option to the North Antrim seat following Mr McKay's resignation.
Mr McKay resigned his seat following claims he "coached" loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson as a witness to an inquiry.
He said he accepted his actions were "inappropriate, ill-advised and wrong".
The 'coaching' allegations followed leaked messages between Mr Bryson, Mr McKay and Sinn Féin member Thomas O'Hara.
They exchanged messages before Mr Bryson testified to a Stormont inquiry, chaired by Mr McKay, into the National Asset Management Agency (Nama).
Mr McGuigan was first elected to the Ballymoney Council in 2001, aged 27. He then went on to win the Assembly seat for North Antrim in 2003 and served until 2007.
In 2007, Daithí McKay contested the North Antrim MLA seat and Mr McGuigan stood down as an MLA, remaining as a Sinn Féin councillor.

article Its release into the atmosphere drove the shift towards a warmer period, according to scientists at the University of Southampton.
The research, published in Nature, is based on analysing chemical signals in the shells of ancient plankton.
The world's oceans absorb about a third of the atmospheric carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels.
Scientists predict that as the oceans warm, their ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide will be reduced, potentially leading to faster global warming.
Dr Miguel Martinez-Boti, who co-led the study, said the findings showed that there was a link between very high concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in parts of the ocean and rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide at the end of the last Ice Age.
"This increases our understanding of the role of the ocean in the carbon cycle," he told BBC News.
"The ocean is a much bigger reservoir for carbon than the atmosphere, so how the ocean interacts with the atmosphere is very important."
The research is based on analysis of ancient marine organisms that lived on the surface of the oceans thousands of years ago.
The acidity of the seawater they inhabited can be gleaned from the chemical signature left in their shells, which in turn allows the amount of carbon dioxide in the water to be calculated.
Co-researcher, Dr Gavin Foster, said: "Just like the way the oceans have stored around 30% of humanity's fossil fuel emissions over the last 100 years or so, our new data confirms that natural variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide between ice ages and warm interglacials are driven largely by changes in the amount of carbon stored in our oceans."
The waters around Antarctica - known as the Southern Ocean - are thought to play a key role in the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, land and sea.
Scientists need to understand more about how the ocean affects the carbon cycle to gain a better insight into climate change.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, about 40% of carbon dioxide emissions since pre-industrial times have remained in the atmosphere.
The ocean has absorbed about 30%, causing ocean acidification.

article Olsen, 66, announced in March he would leave when his contract expired at the end of the campaign.
Following the 4-3 aggregate loss, he confirmed he would leave immediately.
"I have told the players that the Danish FA and I have agreed I stop," said Olsen. "In recent months, we have been too unstable in our performances."
Olsen, who won 102 caps for Denmark as a player between 1970 and 1989, took charge after Euro 2000.
He has taken the Danes to four major finals, qualifying for the 2002 and 2010 World Cups, and the European Championships in 2004 and 2012.
But they failed to reach next summer's finals in France, losing in the play-off after finishing third in their qualifying group behind Portugal and Albania.
"It hurts to end this way after more than 35 years as a player and coach but I feel most sorry for the Danes, for the fans, " Olsen added. "I feel empty with regards to the match."
The Danish Football Association (DBU) said it hoped to appoint a new coach before the end of the year.
"I have great respect for Morten and his results. It is important for both Morten and I that the end of his phenomenal career in Danish football is done in a dignified and orderly manner," added DBU president Jesper Moller.

article The event requires funding from Northern Ireland's government but is at risk after the collapse of Stormont.
Louise Martin, the federation's president, had set Thursday as the deadline to release funding.
Northern Ireland is due to be handed the event next month at the closing ceremony of the 2017 games.
Stormont collapsed in January and a deadline to restore the devolved institutions passed on Thursday.
Talks between Northern Ireland's political parties will now continue until Monday.
The Commonwealth Games Federation said it has been encouraged by political support but "empathises with the administration's current circumstances".
Sources have told the BBC that the federation will monitor political developments over the weekend before a decision is taken on the games' future.
The business case for funding the games has been with the Department of the Economy, but was not approved by former DUP economy minister Simon Hamilton so was not brought to the executive table.
The department said the games were not "value for money", but the BBC understands that ministers could still have approved the project if it had been discussed, and backed, by the executive.
All five main political parties attended a meeting with games officials in Belfast last Tuesday to try to find a way forward.
About 1,000 young athletes are due to take part in the games, which would have been a landmark event for Northern Ireland's centenary year.
Sports stars like Carl Frampton, Michael Conlon, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Beth Tweddle and Louis Smith have all taken part in previous events.

article The yacht Northabout left Bristol, UK, in June and circled the North Pole in an anticlockwise direction.
Its exit from Canada's Lancaster Sound on Monday signalled the successful navigation of both sea routes.
Mr Adams initiated the project to highlight Arctic sea-ice decline.
For so long an impenetrable barrier for mariners, the NEP and NWP have increasingly opened up in recent years as temperatures in the polar north have warmed.
This week, Arctic sea-ice reached the second-lowest extent ever recorded by satellites - a fact "verified 'on the ground' (water). It's real. We've been there," the Polar Ocean Challenge project told the BBC.
Ice has been so minimal around the islands that make up Canada's northern polar region that Northabout was able to sweep through the NWP in just two weeks.
Monday also saw confirmation that the second ship lost in the Arctic by 19th Century explorer Sir John Franklin has been found.
The Guardian newspaper reports that HMS Terror was identified in "almost pristine condition" sitting at the bottom of Terror bay.
Franklin's other ship, HMS Erebus, was found two years ago.
The explorer's attempt to chart the NWP in the 1840s was undone by thick ice, and cost the lives of more than 120 men.
His expedition's disappearance became one of the great maritime mysteries as a succession of search and rescue missions failed to find any trace of the ships and their crew.
The 15m-long, aluminium-hulled Northabout is now heading to Greenland and expects to get to Upernavik late on Wednesday.
The yacht will then sail south, down the west coast of Greenland, dodging icebergs from the country’s great outlet glaciers, before reaching across the North Atlantic for the return to the UK.
It expects to arrive home in October.
"That will be the end of the second quest, which will be a circumnavigation of the North Pole in one summer season - which strengthens the point," the project said.
Scientists fully expect commercial traffic in the NEP and NWP to grow in the coming decades as the region continues to warm.
A recent study found that by mid-century the opportunities for non ice-strengthened vessels to transit the Arctic could double, even if strong measures were taken to tackle climate change.

Security was stepped up for the visit, with helicopters flying overhead and roads in the area sealed off.
About 150 world leaders are attending the summit which opens on Monday.
Mr Obama's motorcade went straight to the Bataclan shortly after the US president arrived at Orly Airport.
After placing his rose, Mr Obama stood in silence with his head bowed and his hands clasped in front of him. He then walked away with his arms around Mr Hollande and Ms Hidalgo.

What happened on the night
The investigation so far
The attacks - claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group - on 13 November left 130 people dead and more than 360 wounded.
Gunmen opened fire or set off bombs at seven locations in the city.
France is still in a state of emergency after the attacks.
French prosecutors say at least 11 militants in three co-ordinated teams were involved in the killings.
Nine are dead and two suspects - Salah Abdeslam and Mohamed Abrini - are still on the run.
French police have carried out hundreds of raids across the country and raids have also taken place in the Belgian capital Brussels where some of the attackers were from.
Earlier on Sunday, more than 200 demonstrators were arrested in Paris after clashes with police.
It came as climate change activists formed a human chain along the route of a march that was called off after the attacks.
Some of the demonstrators in Place de la Republique were apparently protesting against France's state of emergency, and have been disowned by the main organisers.

article US media reports said he had shared material that was passed on by a partner that had not given permission.
The White House refused to comment on reports that Israel was the source.
Though not illegal, Mr Trump's alleged gaffe is seen as a breach of trust by many in the intelligence community.
Mr Trump met Sergei Lavrov last week in the Oval Office, out of view of the US media.
Leading Republicans and Democrats have voiced concerns over what was said, with top Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer calling for the transcripts to be released by the White House.
The US Senate Intelligence Committee has also asked for copies of any notes taken in the meeting. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is due to brief the committee later.
Mr Trump's alleged disclosures are not illegal, as the US president has the authority to declassify information.
Mr Trump tweeted: "As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety.
"Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against [IS] & terrorism."
It is not clear if Mr Trump was acknowledging having shared intelligence secrets with the Russian officials, thus contradicting White House statements, or whether he was simply trying to explain what had been discussed.
The BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says this was a carefully constructed defence of the meeting, in which President Trump frames any revelation of intelligence information as a calculated move to advance US national security priorities.
After all, the controversy that swirled around the White House on Monday night was never legal, it was political, and this defence may be enough for Republicans to rally around, he adds.
A report in the Washington Post on Monday said Mr Trump had confided top secret information relating to an IS plot thought to centre on the use of laptop computers on aircraft.
In a conversation with the Russian foreign minister and Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in the Oval Office on 10 May, the president revealed details that could lead to the exposure of a source of information, officials told the paper.
The intelligence disclosed came from a US ally and was considered too sensitive to share with other US allies, it added.
Others at the meeting realised the mistake and scrambled to "contain the damage" by informing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA), says the Post.
The meeting came a day after Mr Trump fired his FBI chief, James Comey, sparking criticism that he had done so because the FBI was investigating his election campaign's alleged Russian ties.
On Tuesday, US media reported the divulged material had been provided to the US by Israel, where Mr Trump is due to visit next week.
Pressed by reporters on Tuesday, National Security Adviser HR McMaster declined to say whether or not Mr Trump had shared classified information with the Russians.
He denied the US president had caused a "lapse in national security".
"What the president discussed with the foreign minister was wholly appropriate to that conversation and is consistent with the routine sharing of information between the president and any leaders with whom he's engaged."
He also said President Trump had not been aware of the source of information that was discussed with the Russian officials.
Despite the denials issued by the White House that any actual intelligence sources were revealed to the Russians, whatever was said in that Oval Office meeting was enough to alarm certain officials and, reportedly, to alert the CIA and NSA.
They in turn will have needed to warn the country that supplied the intelligence. There is a golden rule in the world of espionage that when one government supplies intelligence to another it must not be passed on to a third party without permission of the original supplier. The reason is simple: it could put the lives of their human informants at risk.
In this case it appears to relate to the discovery of plans by jihadists in Syria to devise a way of smuggling viable explosive devices on board a plane inside a laptop computer. Given the well-publicised ban on laptops in cabins on certain Middle Eastern routes, whoever revealed that information is unlikely to be still in place.

article Led by 20-year-old  Sima Azimi,  the Shaolin Wushu club practises on a snow-covered mountaintop to the west of Kabul.
Developed from ancient Chinese martial arts, the sport of wushu sees these young women moving fluidly, slicing the air with silver swords.
After learning the sport in Iran, Sima won medals in competition and says: "My ambition is to see my students take part in international matches and win medals for their country."
Despite the popularity of martial arts in Afghanistan, women's sport is severely restricted.
All of the women in the club are Hazara, a Dari-speaking, mainly Shia group. They have generally more liberal social traditions that allow them to practise sports outside the home.
In addition to the regular dangers of life in Kabul, these women face intimidation and abuse.  One member, Shakila Muradi, says: "There are many people harassing us, but we ignore them and follow our goals."
Sima has been teaching in Kabul for about a year, training at the club's gym with her father.
This gym has a large poster of stuntman Hussain Sadiqi, a Hazara martial arts champion who fled to Australia to work in film.
Her father declares his pride in his daughter.  "I am really happy that I helped, encouraged and supported Sima," he says.

article The Ibrox club were ejected from the first qualifying round of the Europa League by a team that finished fourth in their domestic league last season.
"It's an embarrassing result, given the investment (in the squad)," said Rae of his former club's 2-1 aggregate defeat.
"I have never seen them lose to a team of this calibre."
Rae, now 48, told BBC Scotland that he felt Pedro Caixinha's new-look team lacked the drive he would have expected to see as Rangers returned to European football for the first time in six years.
They had won the Ibrox leg 1-0 and in the starting XI in Luxembourg fielded four of their summer signings - Fabio Cardoso, Ryan Jack, Daniel Candeias and Alfredo Morelos, with a further two, Dalcio and Eduardo Herrera, making substitute appearances.
"They are only three or four weeks into their pre-season but with the quality that Rangers have allegedly brought in you would expect them to go through in a tie like this," said Rae, who played in the Champions League and Uefa Cup with Rangers in 2004 and 2005.
"It's OK if it's a one-off, you can lose cup games, but over two games you would expect them to get through.
"I was disappointed with the manner in which they played. They never got any combinations, there was no tempo or intensity and you could actually see it coming. It's as bad a performance and result as you're going to get.
"They just didn't create enough good chances. They had a couple of headers that you would have expected them to score, with (Niko) Kranjcar and (Josh) Windass and Kenny Miller hitting the bar.
"It would have to be up there with one of their worst performances and results in Europe. I think everybody is in shock.
"The way Scottish football is going, we're going to be a laughing stock."
Rae predicted that the Portuguese manager would come in for scrutiny in the coming weeks but he did not think Caixinha would resign or be sacked.
"He seems quite a confident guy in his ability and what he's trying to do," he said.
"The board have backed him to the hilt. I would expect them to back him and give him time to turn it around.
"The eight signings are just in the door. The season starts in four weeks. This will give Caixinha time to work with them. They will need to hit the ground running."

article One of the most influential Facebook groups calling for people to take to the streets was "We are all Khaled Said", set up in memory of a young man alleged to have been killed by police officers in Alexandria in 2010.
Yet to date, there have been relatively few reforms and the crisis in Egyptian policing has only deepened.
The police are less feared than before the revolution and at the same time less respected than ever. As a result, morale in the force is low. And now, Egyptians are dealing with a security vacuum.
Recently there has been a spate of serious crimes of a kind not seen in the past, including armed bank robberies and kidnappings for ransom. Petty theft has risen dramatically.
People found it easy to believe that the security forces were either negligent or directly implicated in February's football violence in Port Said that left more than 70 people dead.
In an unusually candid interview with a former senior police officer, I heard first-hand why the forces meant to protect Egyptians have become better known for corruption and brutality.
"Egyptian police ruled the country from behind an iron curtain. They controlled all aspects of life," says Mahmoud Qutri who retired as a police brigadier in 2001.
"If you wanted to be promoted in a government job then you needed approval from state security, even if you were a low-level employee."
He explains how police abused their sweeping powers in many ways.
"Much of what I saw was shocking," he says. "Police officers would bully people, torture them, 'sex-up' cases and deliberately send innocent people to jail."
Mr Qutri gives the example of a father who went to report his daughter missing only to be tortured and imprisoned himself before she returned home of her own accord.
In another case, he says, a young army conscript was jailed after being forced to confess to raping and killing a woman who later turned up unharmed.
The ex-police brigadier's descriptions of torture methods commonly used by Egyptian security services are most disturbing.
"Police can use finger prints or other technologies in criminal investigations but they don't have enough resources so they use other techniques that save time and money," Mr Qutri tells me.
"Usually they cuff your hands and put a bar under your knees and beat your feet. Sometimes they handcuff and hang you on a door until your shoulder breaks," he says.
"In Bedouin areas where masculinity means a lot, I have seen men electrocuted on their genitals. They also blow air into a man's anus and jump on the stomach. In state security departments, they might bring someone's wife, sister or daughter and rape her to make him confess."
Mr Qutri says it was impossible to speak out while he was in his old job but since his retirement he has acted as a whistleblower. In 2004, he evaded censors to publish a book, Confessions of a Police Officer, which led to lawsuits and personal threats.
Only since Egypt's popular uprising has he felt freer to call for radical changes to the police system.
He complains of a culture that breeds hostility and disdain.
"The police students are taught how to be very arrogant. In the academy they are ordered to walk in a certain way, not to use public transport nor sit in cafes," he says. "By graduation they feel they are more important than ordinary people."
Mr Qutri recommends new programmes that teach trainees about law and human rights as well as better pay for lower ranking police and an end to a quota system which he says, leads to the fabrication of crimes.
He argues that under the former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, state security was prioritised over public security but that this must now change.
Several draft initiatives to restructure and reform the security sector are already being submitted to parliament.
Omar Ashour of the Doha Brookings Institute and Exeter University has helped draw up one set of proposals.
"There needs to be accountability towards citizens - whether the parliament or the president - the idea of controlling the security sector has to be enshrined in the [new] constitution," says Mr Ashour.
A senior Muslim Brotherhood official, Amr Darrag, identifies security reform as the top priority for his organisation's Freedom and Justice Party - which controls nearly half the seats in the new People's Assembly.
"This is probably the most important issue that we would like to tackle because it's the key for stability and that's key for any economic development or further reform," he says.
In the past year, the ruling military has been criticised for making relatively few changes.
The only notable developments have been the disbanding of the State Security Investigations Service and putting Mr Adly on trial for corruption and giving orders that led to the killing of hundreds of demonstrators.
A new investigation into the protests that followed the Port Said deaths by the human rights group Amnesty International concluded that riot police from the central security forces used the same "excessive force" that was deployed when trying to suppress Egypt's uprising. Sixteen people were killed and hundreds injured in Cairo and Suez.
"Unless the Egyptian security apparatus is reformed with the aim of providing security and upholding the right to peaceful protest, we fear more bloodshed will follow," says Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International.

article Mohammed Istiak Alamgir, 36, Yousaf Bashir, 35 and Rajib Khan, 37, are accused of making speeches which urged support for the militant group.
Mr Khan and another man Ziaur Rahman, 38, allegedly helped organise meetings where such speeches were made.
The men were remanded in custody until 8 January when they will appear at the Old Bailey.
During the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, prosecutor Mark Dawson accepted the alleged meetings had primarily been for prayer but said they had also been used to spread hatred.
The men were arrested following a joint operation by the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command and the Eastern Counter Terrorism and Intelligence Unit on 2 December.

article A study of cheetahs has shown that instead, the animal uses incredible acceleration and rapid changes in speed when hunting.
The animals get this acceleration by exerting nearly five times more power than that of famed sprinter Usain Bolt during his record-breaking 100m run.
The results are published in the journal Nature.
The findings amazed the scientist who led the research, Prof Alan Wilson of the Royal Veterinary College in Hatfield, UK.
"They are remarkable athletes - not just in terms of their speed, but also with their ability to accelerate and manoeuvre in capturing the prey," he told BBC News.
The top speed for a cheetah is often quoted is 65mph (105km/h) - a result measured in 1965 and published in the Journal of Zoology three decades later by a scientist in Kenya. He was timing the run of a semi-domesticated cheetah running in a straight line on a firm dirt track.
But a well-fed zoo cheetah is not accustomed to running very fast - it does not need to. As a result, few measurements of zoo cheetahs found speeds greater than that of a greyhound, about 40mph (64km/h).
So for years, researchers wondered whether cheetahs might run much faster than 65mph in the wild in order to capture prey.
Prof Wilson and his team at the college's Structure and Motion Laboratory decided to find out by following five animals in the wild for a year using tracking collars fitted with movement detectors and GPS systems.
They found that the cheetahs did indeed run very fast at times - close to 60mph - but only occasionally. On most hunts they attained about 30 to 35 mph but they were accelerating and changing direction much more rapidly than has been seen in any other land animal.
They found that cheetahs could increase their speed by nearly 7mph (10km/h) in a single stride.
"They've arranged to have a low gear so they can accelerate very rapidly up to their top speed," said Prof Wilson.
Short bursts of speed can be quantified in power per kilogramme of the animal's weight. Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt exerted 25 W/kg during his record-breaking run in 2009.
A horse used in a polo match exerts slightly more power per kg, around 30 W/kg, and a greyhound's is double that at 60 W/kg. But a cheetah can reach 120 W/kg.
The researchers also found that cheetahs also have a very strong grip, so much so that they rip up the ground as they run.  They found it was the use of the animals' claws that enabled them to turn very sharply and to accelerate and decelerate very quickly.
The measurements have only been made possible because of the collars that have been developed by Prof Wilson specifically for the experiment.
"It is very hard for GPS to work on an animal that is ducking and diving, so the collar is an innovation in its own right," he said.
"We've been working on GPS for 12 years and the collars are the result of those labours. They are not your typical GPS tracking system that you get in the car or phone.
"The GPS is far more accurate we are getting positions and speeds five times a second. We combine those with readings from other instruments and we finish up with something that is very much more accurate both in terms of speed and position and very much more robust," Prof Wilson explained.
The team are currently using the collars to track lions and African wild dogs to obtain comparative measurements.

It was tight, tense and seemingly destined for a draw until Gareth Bale rose to the occasion to head in their Euro 2016 qualifier winner against Cyprus. It means the men in red are on the verge of qualifying for Wales' first major tournament since 1958 and a win against Israel on Sunday will do that.
Here are the thoughts of some of those who battled alongside Bale to put them on the cusp of reaching Euro 2016 in France.

So says captain and defender Ashley Williams: "He didn't have his best game, you know, to his standard - a lot of things didn't go for him and he can't be perfect all the time.
"But [it was] an unbelievable goal. I don't think anyone else in the squad would have scored that. He jumped so high.
"When he's on the pitch, he can always do that for you."
Tottenham Hotspur defender Ben Davies: "It was a great header, but it's nothing we as players haven't come to expect from him, really."
Swansea skipper Williams: "We would like to do it at home [for the fans].
"I thought they were unbelievable with their support again… they made a lot of noise and they really backed us and we needed it again at times.
"I even heard my name being sung!"
Williams' fellow defender BenDavies: "It was unbelievable to see that many Welsh fans over here (Cyprus)."
Reading's ex-Cardiff City defender Chris Gunter: "Hopefully if we do our jobs, then we can join in with everyone [celebrating] on Sunday."

Ashley Williams: "Hopefully. That's what we've worked so hard for over the last few years.
"It isn't done yet, so until it is done - that's when we'll celebrate.
"I've said it before, it would be my proudest achievement to lead this unbelievable group of lads to France and it's still the same.
"You can't help but think about the final whistle going and winning - that'll drive us on a little bit more and I'm sure we'll enjoy it if and when that happens."
Arsenal's midfielder Aaron Ramsey: "We know what's on the line for Sunday so hopefully we can have that opportunity and put on a bit of a show to gather the three points.
"It would mean the world to me to qualify.
"Hopefully [we'll] be a bit better with the ball than we were tonight… we're in a great position to do it."
Ex-Swansea player Ben Davies: "Sometimes we have to grind results out and that's what we did.
"As a back five we wanted to keep a clean sheet and we did. Luckily we've got the quality up top to get us games.
"We've been in situations, all of us really, where we've had games where we have to win, but never really to take us to that promised land.
"It's going to be tough. It's going to be nerve-wracking, but we can't wait."
Former Cardiff defender Chris Gunter: "We've never been in this position of being one game away from qualifying.
"I think every game as we've gone through the group has been bigger and bigger and I think we've dealt with it really well.
"Believe it or not through the week, we haven't once talked about the points we need or what's to come.
"We have just focused on performing. If we perform well, then we feel that the results will come and that's been the case so far."

article In a letter to school governors seen by the BBC, the employers said the proposed strike action by some NASUWT members later this month is based on a ballot conducted five years ago.
In response, the NASUWT maintain their plans for action are entirely lawful.
Their members at schools in Belfast and Newtownabbey are due to stage a one-day walk out on 30 November.
The action is over pay, workload and job insecurity.
The letter is from the management side of the Teachers' Negotiating Committee.
It represents the main school employing bodies, including the Education Authority (EA) and the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).
The letter points out that the strike is based on a ballot taken "in November 2011".
"We reserve the right to challenge the legality of the current action with particular reference to the unacceptable continuous rolling over and escalation of the industrial action purportedly authorised by historic ballots notwithstanding clear changes to the nature of the disputes," it said.
Last month, all teaching unions in Northern Ireland rejected an offer which would have seen their pay frozen last year and a rise of 1% for 2016-17
The other teaching unions - INTO, UTU and ATL - are currently taking non-strike industrial action.
For example, INTO members are not attending school meetings arranged before school or at break or lunchtime.
The employers' letter said that they want to resolve the industrial action.
However, it said they "are concerned about the long-term nature of the industrial action the unions are currently engaged in and the detrimental impact on the education of pupils and effective running of schools".
In response, the NASUWT said that they are pursuing "a lawful trade dispute on pay, pensions, working conditions and jobs which has been recognised by the education minister
"The NASUWT's plans for strike action are entirely lawful and members participating in the NASUWT industrial action will continue to be protected in law by the existing yes vote from the ballot of all members conducted in 2011."
Principals of all schools have also been sent a letter advising them on how to handle the strike action.

article Starc took pain-killing injections for an ankle injury during last week's first-Test in Cardiff.
The 25-year-old took seven wickets and batted for an hour in the fourth innings of the 169-run loss to England.
And Clarke says Starc has reacted "positively" to treatment ahead of the start of the second Test on Thursday.
"Spending a bit of time with the Australian physio, he's confident that, although it's a short turnaround before the second test, there's been a lot of positives that have come out of the last couple of days since he was cortisoned, and things are going really well there," Clarke told Melbourne radio station Triple M.
"Starcy obviously had some ankle pain and had an injection to bowl in the second innings, but the positive again was the fact he was able to bowl and do what was needed for the team.
"He batted as well in the second innings and ran between the wickets fine.
Should Starc, who was named player of the tournament at this year's World Cup, fail to prove his fitness, Australia have Peter Siddle or Pat Cummins in reserve.
Australia have already suffered one significant bowling injury during this tour, with Ryan Harris withdrawing and subsequently retiring from the game because of a knee problem.
England have named an unchanged 13-man squad for Lord's.

article Charlotte, 16 months, was heard speaking in public for the first time - saying "pop" at the balloons that filled Government House in Victoria.
The residence was transformed into a children's paradise, which included a petting zoo and miniature ponies.
The play day was on day six of the Cambridges' eight-day tour of Canada.
It is the first official trip all four of the family have been on together.
By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent
Those who chronicle the lives of the Cambridges now know that balloons are the way to a 16-month-old princess's heart and Charlotte's first public utterance was to use the word "pop".
And for toddler George there was much fun to be had squirting bubbles at his father - even if he is a future king of Canada and the UK.
Considerable column inches are generated from such offerings. The power of the images is considerable.
The children personify the future of the Canadian monarchy in a country that may, one day, chose a different path.
There's no sign, at the moment, of that being the desire of the majority of Canadians.
George and Charlotte, on display, will not become an everyday occurrence.
William and Kate are determined their children grow up in private and not in public.  This party will attract global attention because of its rarity value.

Prince William could be heard saying "are we going to go pop?" to his daughter and then asked her: "Would you like a balloon, Charlotte?"
Charlotte is said to have made everyone in the grounds of Government House - the home of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia -  laugh when she tried to lift up a huge balloon archway that led to the petting zoo.
George appeared excited by the attractions and could not resist squirting Charlotte with bubbles.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were said to be happy that the event had been staged for them and pleased their son and daughter had the opportunity to play with others.

article The Red Hands routed Derry 3-14 to 0-12 at the same stage last year.
As a player, Barton never took a backward step against Tyrone and he is demanding the same of his charges.
"Unless you are going to rise to the challenge, recognise it, react to it, there is no point in being there," said the Derry boss of the Celtic Park tie.
Barton makes no secret of the personal hurt he felt last year as two Ronan O'Neill goals and another three-pointer from Peter Harte effectively put the game to bed by half-time as Tyrone led 3-8 to 0-6.
But while some pundits feel the apparent gulf in class between the top-tier Ulster champions and a Derry team relegated to Division Three means that the Oak Leafers should be looking at damage limitation this weekend, Barton insists his players must aim for victory.
"We have to represent ourselves better than last year. I remember saying after the game that we weren't as fit, as fast or as strong as them.
"Only time will tell whether we get it right on the 28th. But certainly our focus is to win the game although it's going to be very difficult."
Sunday's match will be the seventh meeting between the counties since Barton took the Derry job in the autumn of 2015.
Tyrone have won all six encounters thus far although Barton points out that his side wasted a glorious chance to beat the Red Hands in the Dr McKenna Cup decider 16 months ago, when Mickey Harte's men eventually won the tempestuous game in extra-time.
"If we had cleared the wire in the last kick (of normal) time, we probably would have won it. That would have put a different perspective on the rest of our season, perhaps.
"But I don't really look at it that way. Every day, you have got to go out and perform. Tyrone will have to perform against us. Obviously, we will be starting as second favourites. We certainly will have to put in a big performance to beat them."
Tyrone's already strong favouritism from Sunday's match was only increased by Derry's relegation to Division Three as home defeats by Down and Cork ultimately sealed the Oak Leafers' fate despite a closing last-gasp win over Fermanagh.
Barton says both the management and players were "seriously disappointed" by Derry's demotion.
"We scored quite a bit in the league but conceded far too much. The maths tell you everything."
With a number of players making themselves unavailable to the squad, much to Barton's frustration, the manager was left with little option but to attempt to blood inexperienced performers into the side.
"Some of the younger players dipped their toe in the water. It's a step learning curve for them but they are players who want to play for Derry.
"We have been stabilised by the return of some of the Slaughtneil players (after the completion of the All-Ireland Club campaign) which is a very positive thing.
"We didn't have them until the last two league games but at that stage we were playing catch-up."
While the Spring campaign was a huge disappointment, Barton points out that his side were "within a kick of the ball" of reaching last year's All-Ireland quarter-finals as they lost out 1-21 to 2-17 to eventually surprise semi-finalists Tipperary.
"Again, we conceded too much in that game so for sure we need to get our act together at the back - particularly against someone like Tyrone."
Barton's club managerial career in three counties saw him taking charge of Ballinderry, Loup, Burren, Donaghmore and Slaughtneil, in addition to a stint as UUJ boss, but says none of those roles prepared him for the onerous task that is inter-county management.
Reading between the lines, Barton's biggest headache has been securing access to players amid the fierce inter-club rivalries within the Oak Leaf County.
"I'm delighted to hear that Croke Park is thinking about dividing the county and club seasons a little bit better because it can be very divisive - particularly this time of year.
"There are a whole lot of facets that have made it (inter-county management) very difficult. It's one of the hardest things I have ever done emotionally but you get on with it. I'm still very proud and honoured to have the opportunity."

article Scientists think they now have some answers.
They are places where impacts have excavated a briny layer of water-ice under the dwarf planet's surface, the researchers tell the journal Nature.
And the very brightest features are the youngest, freshest exposures.
The framing camera on the US space agency's Dawn probe has catalogued some 130 spots on the 950km-wide world. But by far the most impressive collection is to be found in a crater dubbed Occator in Ceres' northern hemisphere.
When the probe arrived at the dwarf, the camera settings were programmed to take account of what is generally a very dark surface - as black as asphalt. But this meant the super-bright depressions within Occator completely overwhelmed the instrument's sensor.
"We said, 'Wow! What's that? We didn't expect this,'" recalls Andreas Nathues, the camera's principal investigator.
"The reflectivity is in the order of 0.25, which means about 25% of the light is reflected; and in the inner core centre [of the Occator spot collection] it's even more - up to 50-60% of the light is reflected; while the remaining surface is rather dark - the average is about 9%," said the scientist from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Goettingen, Germany.
Subsequent investigation now indicates that there is likely a global layer of ice and salt under the rocky rubble that coats Ceres.
When a space impactor digs into this layer and exposes it, the ice starts to sublime (to turn directly from a solid to a gas).  The released vapour then escapes away from the surface, lifting ice and dust particles in the process, to produce a kind of haze.
Dawn has observed this haze during "day times", as it has looked across Occator at very oblique angles.
The judgement is that Occator's spots will fade over time as most of the ice is driven off, leaving only salts behind.
Dawn sees a signature for hydrated magnesium sulphate - what we would call "Epsom salts" - dominating at other spot locations.
Salts are not quite so reflective as the relatively fresh ice at Occator.
The water emission - which incidentally chimes now with some observations of Ceres made by the Herschel space telescope in 2013 - is reminiscent of comets, which engage in this sublimation behaviour whenever they get near the sun.
"It's a bit like a comet, but you need to understand that Ceres is a partially differentiated body. So, it has a shell structure," Dr Nathues told me in an interview for this week's Science In Action programme on the BBC World Service.
"There is very likely an ice shell below the crust. And this is completely different from comets. Comets are primitive objects, having original material that is only very, very slightly changed."
In a separate report to Nature, Maria Cristina De Sanctis raises the possibility that Ceres did not form in the position it now finds itself (about 415 million km from the Sun), but much further out in the Solar System.
She has been looking at the results from Dawn's Visible-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer.
It sees what are interpreted to be ammoniated phyllosilicates across large parts of the dwarf's surface.
Phyllosilicates are clay minerals, which are produced when other rock materials are altered by water over a prolonged period.
However, it is the ammonia signal that is very interesting in this instance.
"These are phyllosilicates that have some ammonia in their structure. But to have this kind of structure means the ammonia must have been available at some point. And the only way we can see this as being possible is to have a colder origin for the material," said Dr De Sanctis from the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome, Italy.
This thinking follows from the recognition that ammonia ices would not be stable at Ceres' current orbit around the Sun. Such ices are rapidly lost above about 100 kelvin (-173C).
So, for Ceres to have retained a lot of ammonia or nitrogen-rich ices, for long enough to be incorporated into the clays, it probably had to occupy a much colder location sometime in its past, argues the Dawn researcher.
"It's an amazing suggestion but there are dynamical models for the evolution of the Solar System that foresee bodies migrating inwards," she told BBC News.

article The women's game attracted crowds of more than 50,000 before the FA move in 1921.
To celebrate International Women's Day, the 37-year-old took part in a Q&A session in her role as BBC Sport's guest editor.
She discussed topics such as Manchester United's lack of a senior women's team and England's hopes for Euro 2017, along with the CBeebies show Footy Pups, which Yankey hosts in a bid to help encourage a new generation of sports stars.
BBC presenters Clare Balding, Gabby Logan and Jess Creighton were among those to fire questions at the former winger.
What would women's football look like now if the FA had not banned it and what improvements would she like to see? (Clare Balding)
Wow, what a fantastic question! It's a tricky one to answer. No one really knows but I'd like to think the attendances and participation levels would be on a par with the men's game.
And to the follow up question, I would love to see the standard of play improve to make the game more attractive as a spectator sport. And of course the amount of coverage within the media could always be better.
Can England women win the 2019 World Cup? (Gabby Logan)
The Euros this year will be a massive challenge for the team but with two more years of experience, who knows what can happen. Hopefully with talent like [forward] Georgia Stanway from Manchester City coming through, the team will have a bright future!
What can England take away from their 1-0 defeat by Germany in the SheBelieves Cup? (Jess Creighton)
I don't think it's a bad result at all. I think if you take a look at where England are in preparation, obviously our league hasn't started yet. The French and German teams are in season so our players are naturally not as match fit as everyone else. Losing 1-0 to Germany… in years gone by I've been on the side losing by many more goals than one.
The real test now is in the Euros. It's a chance for [manager] Mark Sampson and the squad to gel as a team and for him to look at his players and make a difficult selection for the Euros.
The difficult thing now is the expectation and the players have to take that on their shoulders. That's the hard thing to handle and it's more than just going out on the field and playing. Why not dream big? We saw that with [Premier League champions] Leicester.
What do you think about a club like Manchester United which does not have a senior women's team? (Martinez Anibiko Koosa)
I imagine as a football club run as a business that somebody didn't see having a women's team as a financial business idea. Hopefully things will change because Manchester United are a huge club in world football.
If they were to get on board and have a women's first team that would really show a massive turnaround because they had one many years ago. The fact they have a pretty good youth department shows they are keen to progress young players.
How do we encourage more girls to play football from a young age? (Andrew Aspinall)
I am often asked this question, which is why I got involved with the Cbeebies show Footy Pups! On there, I coach a group of children as young as five or six to play football and encourage being active and healthy.
I think it's really important that both boys and girls see a female coach so it doesn't give the impression that football is just a boys game!
My two boys love watching you on CBeebies. Thank you for helping show them women are just as good as men. (Amanda Lombard)
Footy Pups has done really well. We've done two seasons and there are about 60 episodes out there. It's been brilliant. The idea came to me and as soon as I heard what they wanted to do I got involved.
Football is so much more than just kicking a ball. There are so many life skills and we can teach our kids from a really young age that anyone can play football.
What are your thoughts on more women being board members at the FA? (Mark Lygo)
It's positive. Boards need to be diverse and have more women on the board. There's 10 members. If three of them are women, who are the other seven? It can't be the same people who were there previously.
The whole thing needs to change and we need to look at getting more women involved and more ethnic minorities and different age groups. Football is a sport that goes out to everybody and covers so many different people. We all love the game so why not let it be represented by the people!
Should football be a mixed game and will it ever be? (Adam Jonathon Asa Scholes)
Do I want to see senior football as a mixed game? No. I just think the way we're built and made up, it's like having the fastest woman in the world against the fastest man in the world. The guy is going to win. They should play together and develop at a young age when the physical attributes are pretty much the same.
It depends on what you want to see. If you're going to watch a women's game to see high-tempo physical game you're not going to get that. You need to look at it and be open-minded in what the game is. It is still high-speed and physical but at the tempo of the women's game.
Opinion on future (hopefully) female managers managing male senior football teams? (Aaron Case)
Each individual will have different aspirations. I think outside influences will make it extremely difficult for a female to manage a male team. We've seen how the media and fans are looking at [Arsenal manager] Arsene Wenger and [former Leicester boss] Claudio Ranieri.
Imagine if that manager was a woman. People still sadly have the perception that it's a men's game and women don't understand football. People who pass the qualifications and get the right badges should be looked at.
Managing is managing people and managing players, you don't have to be a man to do that. If you've passed those courses you know your stuff anyway.
Chairmen and boards need to be open-minded and if that's the route they want to go down and they find a coach who is the best fit for their club and happens to be a woman, then go for it. But can I see it happening at this moment in time? No, not in England.
Comment on Arsenal's Champions League performance against Bayern Munich. (Zax Wander Hood)
I was on a train up to Manchester so I didn't see the game. I am an Arsenal fan and obviously you never want to see your team lose so I'm disappointed in that.
I think for me it is the bigger picture and we are all looking at Arsene Wenger and pointing the finger there, but as a player you have to look at the players and now I really want the players to stand up.
At the end of the season everyone will look at this season and decide what they want to do moving forward. At this moment in time the players need to stand up, especially with a massive game on Saturday [against Lincoln in the FA Cup].
A chance to get through to the FA Cup semis. The team needs to stick together and the players really need to show what they've got.
Do you think Arsenal Ladies could dominate English football again soon or are Chelsea and Man City too strong? (James Wyatt)
Obviously I'd love to see that happen but I don't think any one team will solely dominate in the way that Arsenal did.
My question for the legend: What law change or adaptation to the game do you think we need in the 21st century? (Kate Vogelsang)
Thanks for the legend comment! It would be difficult to pin down one thing but with the amount of stick referees get these days, something to help them make accurate and fair decisions would always help.
I have actually refereed grassroots football and it is extremely difficult. The pressure from the sidelines was overwhelming and unnecessary so anything to help out the officials would be brilliant. But then I guess fans lose their debate in the pub!

article Murray tweeted on Thursday morning that "no campaign negativity" had "totally swayed" his view on the issue.
Some users of the site sent him hate messages, with one referring to the Dunblane massacre in 1996.
Murray was a pupil at Dunblane Primary school when gunman Thomas Hamilton shot 16 children and their teacher.
Murray's tweet, just hours before polls opened, read: "Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!"
The BBC did not report his comments while polls were open because of strict rules governing broadcasters during elections.
Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: "People who put abuse such as this online should be utterly ashamed of themselves for making such vile, disgusting and distasteful comments.
"We are monitoring social media and where appropriate will take action against those involved.
"Social media is important for many people but it must be used responsibly. There is no place for personal abuse of any kind on it."
The former Wimbledon winner has previously dodged revealing his opinion on independence.
In June he did criticise Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond for waving the country's flag at the tournament last year.
In August, he told the Guardian he did not think it looked likely the result would be a "Yes", but added that his preference would be to represent Scotland if the country became independent.
"If Scotland became independent, then I imagine I would be playing for Scotland," he told the newspaper.
Other celebrities who have received online abuse for revealing their opinions on the referendum include J K Rowling and David Bowie, who both backed a "No" vote.

The former Wales coach said: "It'll be exciting to see these new players making their mark for the first time in the black jersey.
"That said, we're expecting another brutal Test match, with the expectation that Wales will again chuck the kitchen sink at us.
"We've seen over the last two Tests that they're a very good side who play physical, combative and innovative rugby."

article Photos of a Volvo 440 were released by police investigating the disappearance of Luke Durbin, who was last seen in Ipswich on 12 May 2006.
Police wanted to trace the owner of a car which was captured on CCTV nearby.
Det Supt John Brocklebank said: "We had six calls, a number suggesting what could have happened to Luke, but nothing regarding this car."
Mr Durbin, of Hollesley, was 19-years-old when he failed to return home from a night out.
Police said there was a Volvo 440 in the Ipswich area with the number plate M206 LYE at the time, but it was registered under a false name and address.
"We can't categorically say that is the car we see in the image," Mr Brocklebank said.
He said the fact that the vehicle was not properly registered could have played a part in the silent response to the appeal.
"Not registering a vehicle is an offence, but here we've got a young man who has been missing for nine years," he said. "You've got a family who have been waiting that long, just to try and understand why he disappeared and where he is.
"I urge anybody to come forward and allow me to either eliminate that vehicle or give us information in connection with its use."
Mr Brocklebank said police were following up the other phone calls, some of which gave "vague locations" for where Mr Durbin's body could be found.
"Clearly, the people of Suffolk want to find out what happened to Luke Durbin," he said. "They want to understand how a young man can just disappear off the street."

article And yet the greatest political impact will come more from George Osborne's Spending Review and Autumn Statement than perhaps from David Cameron's decision to extend airstrikes over Syria or Labour's uncertainty over how to respond.
Clearly the security crisis prompted by the Paris attacks will not be solved overnight and will give a greater security edge to political debate for years to come. Not for nothing are ministers talking of national security in the same breath as economic security.
But the decisions the chancellor makes over how the state spends four trillion pounds of taxpayers' money over the next five years will have greater political resonance when voters go to the polls in 2020.
Mr Osborne has two problems to solve on Wednesday.
First he has to mitigate his planned £4.4bn cuts to working tax credits which were thrown out by the House of Lords. The chancellor is promising some transitional relief, perhaps by introducing the cuts more gradually or targeting fewer claimants.
But he has competing economic and political pressures. If the Chancellor reduces his tax credit cuts, he will have to cut other benefits elsewhere to avoid breaching his self-imposed legal cap on the amount of money the government spends on welfare.
Many MPs expect him to make up the difference by targeting housing benefits instead - perhaps by making claimants pay the first 10%. The risk is that Mr Osborne might end up hitting the same people who would have felt the brunt of the tax credit cuts.
And that's not the only dilemma. The chancellor needs to soften the tax credit cuts enough to satisfy worried Tory backbenchers and repair the Tory narrative, namely that the party is supposed to be supporting working people rather than reducing their incentives to work.
But at the same time Mr Osborne also needs to press ahead with the cuts so he can both avoid accusations of a U-turn, and also ensure that the pain is not delayed till the end of the parliament when he hopes to be leading the Tory Party into the next election.
The Spending Review is a five-year projection of government spending. In effect, it decides how £4 trillion of taxpayers' money will be spent by setting caps on government departments. Deep spending cuts are expected as Chancellor George Osborne seeks to balance the books.
Explained: Which government departments will be affected?
More: BBC News Spending Review special report
Problem two for the Chancellor is the impact of spending cuts on the police. On Sunday's Andrew Marr show Mr Osborne strongly indicated that planned cuts to police numbers will go ahead. Now in normal times this would be just another spending reduction that he would have to defend as part of his plans to eliminate the deficit.
But these are not normal times and after the attacks in Paris, he will be under some pressure to avoid accusations that he is letting down Britain's guard at a time of increased threat.
So Mr Osborne is emphasising his plans to increase counter-terrorism spending, beef up our cyber defences, and spend more on special forces. But the Home Office has one of the larger Whitehall budgets and the chancellor needs to cut spending somewhere.
And as with tax credits, the concerns are not just felt on Labour benches: many Tory MPs have warned of late about the potential impact on neighbourhood policing which they argue is needed to combat the threat of terrorism. But all the signs are that Mr Osborne will stick to his argument that fewer police has not meant a rise in crime in recent years, in fact quite the opposite.
The bottom line is that finding another £20bn of cuts to public spending will not be easy. It amounts to about a 25% cut for unprotected departments by 2020. The chancellor hinted on the Andrew Marr show that he might even have to water down his target of achieving a £10bn surplus by 2020, something he would be loath to do.
He argues, normally, that if you cannot run a surplus after almost a decade of growth, you never will. But when so much spending is being cut, a surplus of this magnitude might be seen by some as a luxury the government can ill afford.
As for Labour, after a few weeks of dysfunctionality in response to the Paris attacks, the Spending Review provides the party with the welcome relief of finding some issues around which they can unite. However much they are at odds over the party's broader economic policy, Labour MPs and Jeremy Corbyn are at one in their opposition to cuts to tax credits and police numbers.
Two longer term questions will hang over this week's financial announcements.
First, this might be the last Spending Review where quite so much government spending is protected from cuts. The blessed quintet of untouchable budgets comprises health, schools, defence, state pension and overseas aid. That amounts to about a couple of hundred billion pounds a year.
When spending elsewhere is facing such stringent cuts, people might begin to ask tougher questions and ask why these departments should be exempt from the same financial discipline. This is particularly true of health spending which the chancellor is being encouraged to boost in an attempt to smooth over the row with junior doctors over pay.
Second, this might be the Spending Review that finally marks the moment when austerity gains real political saliency. That might sound an odd thing to say after so many years of pain. But over the last parliament, spending cuts were opposed by Labour and other opposition parties but did not appear to change many voters' minds at the general election.
Now, as the cuts bear down harder on budgets that are already tight, it might be possible that people will begin to notice that their parks are less well tended, their streets dirtier, their library opening for fewer days, their street lights on for less time, their bus service less frequent, their local care home closing. And if that happens, as we have seen with tax credits, the politics can suddenly get tricky.
So there are some tough choices to be announced on Wednesday that will shape politics for years to come. George Osborne may privately be quite content that the political debate will move swiftly on, probably the next day, when the prime minister makes his case for sending RAF jets into Syria.
At the very least, those pesky policy wonks from the Institute for Fiscal Studies will get less airtime to mark the Chancellor's homework, as they traditionally do the day after every fiscal event.
summary The UK's budget is a defining moment in the political calendar.

article One of a young goalkeeper who makes the change to striker. Moves to a new club and becomes a defender.
Let go by that club but moves away and returns to the striker role before firing in a goal that helps his country make their way into the European Championship finals.
A bit far fetched it may sound, but this is the real life story of Josh Magennis.
"It's crazy!" Magennis told BBC Scotland. "It was Neil Ardley, who was the academy manager at Cardiff and is now the manager at Wimbledon, who helped me make the transition from goalkeeper.
"He said I had the attributes to be a striker. I managed to knuckle down and find my strengths, which are my pace and power and able to run."
Magennis then made the move north to Aberdeen, where he struggled to hold down a regular spot, although he did have an alternative option.
"We had a tremendous striking group there with Chris Maguire and Scott Vernon who were keeping me out of the team," he said.
"Assistant manager Archie Knox said there was a vacant position at right back and I ended up playing around 30 games in that position."
Magennis, though, fell out of favour when Derek McInnes took over and, after a spell on loan at St Mirren, he joined Kilmarnock, where he has found his shooting boots once again, netting as Kilmarnock defeated Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2-0 at Rugby Park.
In addition, he scored his first goal for Northern Ireland in their recent win over Greece in Belfast. A win that took Michael O'Neill's side to next year's finals in France.
Magennis says he will not look too far ahead and just try to concentrate on helping Kilmarnock up the league table and hope that, when the squad is named next year, he will be one of those on the plane.
"I can't get ahead of myself thinking I will be one of the 23 man squad," he added.
"That would just be insulting to the rest of the lads.
"It is up to me to make sure I am in peak condition for my club and hopefully keep scoring goals.
"It is up to myself to show the manager that in the domestic level and then, if I am picked to go away for the upcoming international friendlies, that I am ready to be part of the squad."

article Vulnerability in defence, lack of steel in midfield, little accuracy in possession, a tendency to lose the plot and to lose goals as a consequence, too many players doing too little for too long.
All of those ailments have been with them pretty much every step of their European journey.
In Istanbul, the deficiencies weren't punished to the max, but the point gained, while breaking the losing narrative, was like a plaster on a gaping wound. The 1-1 draw against Fenerbahce was commendable, but it did little to take the dirty look off the group table now that the wheat has been separated from the chaff.
The positives are not plentiful. Kieran Tierney is undoubtedly the biggest one. The young full-back is a find, a player to gladden Celtic's heart in a time when so few do. Jozo Simunovic was an expensive acquisition and looks to have promise. Leigh Griffiths, his Ajax mishap apart, has been excellent. Others have played decently in pockets of games. Too few pockets, too little impact.
If you're trawling for positives, Kris Commons is one. Evergreen, in every sense. Commons scored his 90th goal for Celtic on Thursday night. The calculation of his number of assists is still being worked on but it's somewhere north of 60.
He has scored four goals and has two assists in his five Europa League games in the group. As a scorer and provider he is prodigious. The wonder is that he hasn't always been appreciated at Celtic Park, not least by his manager, who has stuck him on the bench far too often while others, who have underperformed, have taken on the status of a protected species.
Celtic need Commons not just on the field, but off it. Some saw his uprising in Molde as unprofessional, his railing at his manager and his assistant manager, John Collins, as a lack of respect. Maybe. But what's to respect when you're getting annihilated by Norway's sixth best team?
Anger and frustration tumbled out of him. It's as it should be. Commons has the psyche of a winner. Too many around him don't have the same hunger or, you suspect, the same hurt when it goes wrong.
Celtic lack a lot of things. Characters is one of them. They need more doughty individuals, more leaders. They are callow. A soft touch. There is a sameness about their midfield; honest tryers who huff and puff and don't get much done.
There needs to be a reappraisal of Stefan Johansen, whose use of the ball is oftentimes calamitous in Europe. There needs to be a serious piece of self-examination higher up in the club as to how they have come to a situation whereby they have one realistic option up front, namely, Griffiths.
Nadir Ciftci is second in line. He had played 96 minutes of football since mid-October before his elevation to the first team in Istanbul. And he looked it. Celtic need more firepower, more creativity, more solidity. Standards have slipped a long way in the last few seasons.
There was a time when the uplifting music of George Frideric Handel rang around Celtic Park on Champions League nights. Alas, those tumultuous evenings have gone and they might be a while in coming back.
The signature tune of late has been that of Yohann Zveig, composer of the Europa League anthem, but even Zveig is not going to be heard in the east end for Glasgow for quite some time now that Celtic's winless, and largely joyless, campaign has come to an end.
Six games, three draws and no victories. Rock bottom of their pool with only three clubs from the other 47 involved in the group stages with a worse record in terms of number of goals conceded. In the business of daft goals shipped, Celtic could lay a serious claim to being the pre-eminent soft-touch.
It was fitting, in a grim way, that the last one they conceded was more slapstick than any of the ones that preceded it.
Celtic's players have issued as many apologies for their performances as they have won points in this group. An apology from Virgil van Dijk after the failure in Malmo, an apology from Griffiths after the loss to Ajax and another apology from Johansen on Thursday for his team's all-round deficiencies and, presumably, for their inability to stop self-harming on the football pitch.
Ronny Deila has been in charge of Celtic for 14 Europa League games. His win ratio is 14%. He has been in charge for 26 European matches in total, including qualifiers against some cannon fodder. His win ratio is 31%.
These numbers are an illustration of what Celtic have become. They reflect a lot of things: downsizing in budgets, downsizing in ability, inexperience, a lack of resilience, a lack of concentration, an existence of fear, as Johansen said in the wake of Thursday night.
All of that and more. Deila says his team is rebuilding and that next season will see an improvement. That's what he said last season.
Celtic have much to ponder. They need to ask themselves what are they about now? What is the scale of their ambition? They will not accept that they are an irrelevance in Europe these days, but that is what they have been allowed to become. There are some strange messages coming out of the place.
Collins claimed, surreally, that Celtic were a better side than Molde despite the evidence pointing emphatically in the opposite direction. Deila disagreed and was very critical of his team's performances against Molde, but then on Thursday night he seemed to do a U-turn when saying that Celtic "did well" in those ties.
They didn't. Some of the things being said by Deila and Collins are odds. At times, they seem blind to the reality of their situation. Deila saying that Celtic will be ready for the Champions League next season doesn't have a single fact to back it up. Collins saying that Celtic "could do without" the Fenerbahce match was peculiar. Surely it was an opportunity to start the repair work on a damaged reputation?
This has been Celtic's worst-ever performance in the group stages of European competition. The message from on high is that the management team are under no pressure. Maybe that's reflective of their wider European malaise. Shouldn't they be?

article The duke told Radio 4's Today programme that "everything that wasn't invented by God was invented by an engineer".
He was discussing the merits of British engineering with Today's guest editor, former BP chief executive Lord Browne.
Prince Philip said engineering had contributed to the post-war recovery and would help solve future problems.
The prince, who has an interest in scientific and technological research and development in industry, told the programme that after World War Two "we were completely skint, seriously badly damaged" when engineering had helped the post-war rebuilding process.
Looking to the future and the problems the world's growing population are likely to pose, he said: "But somehow or other that balance to try and fit as many people onto this globe as comfortably as possible without them doing too much damage - I think ultimately it's going to be engineers who are going to decide that."
Asked whether scientists viewed engineers as second-rate, the prince said there was, he assumed, a certain amount of jealousy and anxiety as to whether engineers might be better.
He added it was "curious" that there was no Nobel Prize for engineering.

Then Manchester City decided to save the day with the news Pep Guardiola would be taking over as manager from Manuel Pellegrini at the end of the season.
Did City save transfer deadline day or has Pep ruined 1 February?
As of 12:30 GMT, the most-used transfer deadline day hashtag of #deadlineday had only been tweeted 32,400 times in the UK since midnight.
In that same 12-hour period, it was dwarfed by the top hashtag in the UK - the 1.32 million tweets sending best wishes to Harry Styles of British boy band One Direction using the hashtag #happybirthdayharrystyles.
The Guardiola news broke just after 13:00 GMT and it took just one hour for 61,000 people to tweet about it.
Stoke City look to be the only Premier League club close to breaking any transfer records on transfer deadline day, with chairman Peter Coates confirming talks with Porto midfielder Giannelli Imbula.
The pace of September's deadline day was quickened only by the surprise £36m paid for Monaco teenager Anthony Martial by Manchester United, but this time around none of the top eight have made a last-minute move.
Despite all the hype around 'football's Christmas day', Falcao's shock arrival at Old Trafford and Chelsea's incredible £50m signing of Fernando Torres seem a long time ago.
With many of the bigger clubs looking to do business during the summer, it has been those fighting relegation - and the risk of losing a slice of next year's bumper £5.1bn TV rights deal - that have been more active.

It means clubs with prize assets - such as Berahino, and Everton's John Stones - do not have to sell to the first club that comes along.
Former Leicester City captain Matt Elliott told BBC Sport that clubs can benefit from a late bit of business, but added: "It is a bit of a circus at times, but it has been really quiet this year and the top players rarely become available."
Major signings or not, there was an impressive effort from BBC Sport readers across the world.

article Hundreds of musicians have travelled the wall's 73 miles (117km) using transport including a vintage bus, motorbikes, unicycles and a tractor, passing a baton from performer to performer.
Part of BBC Music Day, the Hadrian's Wall of Sound event began at daybreak in Bowness-on-Solway in West Cumbria and finished in Wallsend, North Tyneside 14 hours later.
BBC TV and radio networks have been broadcasting live across the day and there has been full online coverage.
Dawn on the west coast of England - at Bowness-on-Solway in Cumbria - was serenaded by Carlisle saxophonist Roz Sluman.
A BBC Music Day vintage bus transported performers and the baton across Cumbria and into Northumberland. It appeared to be popular with the wildlife.
Durham-born opera singer Graeme Danby swapped red plush seats and beautiful auditoria for the even more spectacular Cawfield Crag and described himself as "a lucky man". BBC Newcastle sports presenter Simon Pryde - who was dressed for the terrain - took charge of the baton, which Mr Danby then passed to the Royal Northern Sinfonia Wind Quintet.
Good job there was a bus so Susan Lambert did not have to carry her clarsach - a Gaelic harp - up to Walltown Crags on Hadrian's Wall.
Carlisle bandstand was the marginally less al fresco venue for Lake District band mylittlebrother - as heard on BBC Introducing.
A cappella singer Anna Flannagan performed her own composition - The Gift - at Lanercost Priory, near Brampton in Cumbria.
Playing a piece called Secrets of the Night on the piano might not be unusual for Kate Bottomley, but doing it outside on the grass at Errington Hill Head Farm probably was.
The Dalston Male Voice Choir received the baton and performed inside St Michael's Church in Burgh by Sands.
Performing along Hadrian's Wall is not for the faint hearted. Marilyn Framrose and David Hutchinson hitched a ride from Lanercost Priory to Banks East Turret courtesy of Look North's Colin Briggs.
Riding along on the top of the vintage bus, Wallsend guitarist Tom Lapworth was the only musician to travel the entire length of the wall.
Fourteen hours after this musical relay began, the crowds waiting for the finale at the excavated Roman fort Segedunum in Wallsend made their feelings on Hadrian's Wall of Sound clear.

article Barry fronted the show alongside Chris Kelly and wine experts Jilly Goolden and Oz Clarke from 1984 until it came to an end in 2001.
Goolden paid tribute, telling the BBC he was "a larger than life character, ebullient, warm-hearted and generous".
Affectionately known as "the crafty cook", he also wrote 29 cookery books.
'Close friend'
"I'm shocked and saddened by the death of my old colleague and friend with whom I worked happily for 17 years on Food and Drink," Goolden said.
"All the years we worked together, it was as though Michael and I were in a mutual appreciation society - his approach to cooking was fresh and practical, he definitely preferred to be called a cook and not a chef.
"When we started working together I was just beginning my career as a 'wine expert' and Michael was an unswerving support - although he never drank wine himself, he just imagined it from my descriptions.
"His food was always delicious and I enthusiastically tasted absolutely every morsel he cooked for the programme. I considered him a close friend and will miss him," she added.
Born Michael Bukht, he used the pseudonym Barry for his television work which made him a household name.
But he made an even bigger impact in the world of radio broadcasting.
After initially joining the BBC as a trainee in 1963, Barry became programme controller of both radio and television for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation for two years when he was 25.
In 1973 he joined London's Capital Radio as programme director and went on to be programme controller for the GWR group.
Together with the chief executive of the network, Ralph Bernard, Barry co-founded Classic FM in 1992 after spotting a gap in the market.
Barry remained as programme controller of the station until he stepped down in 1997 due to a stress-related illness.
He is survived by the actor and dancer Jennie Jones, a son and three daughters.

article More than 20 rush-hour trains into London from Kent did not run, with some passengers delayed for two hours.
Services between Ashford and London were disrupted when lines were left without power because of overrunning engineering work.
A Southeastern spokesman said services were now "back to normal".
He said the delays caused by the power loss between Maidstone and Swanley "due to overrunning engineering works, which were supposed to be finished on time today.
"We do apologise for the disruption, but it is out of our control - we can only run our services if the track is fit for purpose," he said.
"Around 70% of all delays are down to infrastructure problems and we are challenging Network Rail to ensure that its asset maintenance programme is fit for purpose."
Network Rail responded saying the conductor rail had been damaged when a piece of equipment broke down at Kemsing.
A spokesman said: "We apologise to passengers who were disrupted this morning and would urge passengers to use the delay repay scheme to claim compensation.
During the disruption, passenger Sue Jones tweeted: "Totally fed up - if my performance at work was as poor as the train companies then I would have been fired!"
The bi-annual National Rail Passenger Survey has found the operators with the three lowest ratings all covered south-east England.
Thameslink had the lowest proportion of satisfied passengers at 73%, followed by Southeastern (75%) and Southern (78%).
Earlier this month, Southeastern blamed "bright sunlight" for delays to services through south-east London.

article Tom Jensen, an immigration lawyer in Washington DC, spent a good portion of his day Wednesday on the phone to a frantic client in Iraq.
Jensen was trying to show the man - an Iraqi national who sold supplies to the US military for many years during their time in Baghdad - how to buy a plane ticket online. The man has never flown before.
The man - whom Jensen does not want to name - and his family earned admittance to the US under the Special Immigrant Visa programme, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked for the US military during the conflicts there, often as translators and interpreters. Jensen's client had been threatened repeatedly, first by insurgents and then by the so-called Islamic State, and Jensen briefly lost touch with the family after they fled.
In December 2016, after a three-year process, the man and his family were finally approved for resettlement in the US. They are scheduled to board a plane for the US on 7 February.
But on Wednesday, after a draft copy of President Donald Trump's executive action on refugees and immigration from predominantly Muslim countries was leaked to the press, panic erupted around the globe among refugees, their families and advocates.
Jensen's client considered spending considerable money to buy next-day tickets for himself, his wife and his three children in an effort to outrun President Trump's pen.
No such order was signed on Wednesday or Thursday, and Jensen's client ultimately decided to wait.
"[I'm] feeling frustrated and a little embarrassed, actually, that our government would jerk people around like this," says Jensen. "A guy who risked his life to help the US military during the war - I feel like we owe him."
President Trump finally signed the executive order late Friday afternoon.
It differs slightly from the draft version, though the basic tenets remain the same. The order, titled "Protecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals", has many immigration lawyers scrambling to figure out what will come next.
The most dramatic provisions listed in the draft version suspend all refugee admissions for four months, indefinitely bar entry for Syrian refugees, and suspend all visa entry into the US from several countries for 90 days. Those countries have predominantly Muslim populations, and are reported to be Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen.
Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, spent her Wednesday answering a flurry of emails and phone calls from all over the country.
"Everyone is panicked. No one knows what this means," says Heller. "We have clients whose lives are seriously at risk, who are days away - approved, given visas and simply awaiting travel dates.
"Many of these people are at risk because of their ties to America - either because they have family here or because they worked with American forces."
Sari Long is another immigration lawyer who has been working for months to reunite an Iraqi family - the father entered the US in 2012 under a Special Immigrant Visa for his years of work as an interpreter for both Army soldiers and Marines, and later for American civilian contractors. He has been trying to bring over his wife and sons for years.
Long says she doesn't know if the family would fall under the 90-day ban on visa entry from Iraq, or if they will be classified as "refugees" instead of "immigrants", and have to wait 120 days.
There is also confusion as to what will happen to immigrants and refugees who are already on flights to the US.
Will they be immediately returned to their countries of origin, or given a kind of amnesty?
"They have tickets to fly - we don't know what to tell them," says Long. "We have no information."
Despite the frenzied rumours of what may be to come, Kay Bellor, vice-president of programmes for Lutheran Immigrant Refugee Services, a refugee resettlement agency, says that all of their clients who were booked to enter the country this week have arrived without incident.
She is hoping that her agency will eventually return to business as usual after the Trump administration has a chance to review the vetting processes.
"I was actually working in the US refugee programme on 9/11 and that was just horrific ... and we got through it," says Bellor.
"I think we will get through this. What we've seen of an executive order does not do away with the US refugee programme or the American commitment to refugees. I'm a 'glass half full' kind of person."
However, she, like other refugee advocates, frets that closing the country to refugees and especially to former allies who assisted in US conflicts is actually a threat to national security.
"I think it's really going to hurt our standing in the world," says Heller. "Whatever our next foreign policy adventure is, we're going to need local buy-in. If we abandon our allies on this, we're going to have trouble finding new allies."

article The deal marks the end of the long-running takeover battle for one of the largest car rental firms in the US.
The new partners said the deal would lead to "significant growth opportunities" and $160m of cost savings each year.
The deal has been approved unanimously by both boards but is still subject to regulatory approval.
Both Hertz and rival Avis had made bids for Dollar Thrifty in recent years.
"We are pleased to have finally reached an agreement with Dollar Thrifty after a lengthy - but worthwhile - pursuit," said Hertz chief executive Mark Frissora.
"We have always believed that a combination with Dollar Thrifty is the best strategic option for both companies."
Scott Thompson, chief executive of Dollar Thrifty, said: "After three years of merger-related activity and speculation, I am pleased that we have reached a win-win transaction for both Hertz and Dollar Thrifty."
Combined, the two companies recorded sales of $10.2bn in the year to the end of July.
Hertz also announced the sale of its Advantage business to Franchise Services of North America and Macquarie Capital.

article The soldier, who was held for five years by the Taliban, will take an administrative job on a Texas base.
Sgt Bergdahl was released in May in a swap for five Taliban commanders, a move some US politicians decried.
The army is investigating the circumstances of his capture, including whether he intended to desert.
He will take a job "commensurate to his rank" at US Army North at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston and live in officer quarters there, a base official told the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan.
Colleagues in his "duty section" will offer support, the official said.
Sgt Bergdahl has yet to speak publicly regarding his ordeal since his release on 31 May.
The move to release five Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay after Sgt Bergdahl was transferred to US special forces sparked a heated political row in the US.
The US opened an investigation into his disappearance in 2009 but said investigators would not interview Sgt Bergdahl until he finished the reintegration process.
The US military has concluded he walked away from his base without authorisation before his capture but has stopped short of accusing him of desertion.

article Speaking in the Sunday Mail, Pamela Munro revealed that she had come face to face with John Leathem during the search to find the 15-year-old.
The 32-year-old shop owner stabbed the teenager 61 times and inflicted more than 140 injuries after she went into his shop in Clydebank on 19 March.
He dumped her body in bushes two days after the attack.
Leathem's appeal against his 27-year minimum sentence is due to be heard at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh on Friday.
Ms Munro has been campaigning against any reduction in Leathem's sentence since news of his appeal plans emerged and a petition opposing a cut in his jail term has been signed by about 11,000 people.
Ms Munro, who has three other children, said: "Even if he got out at 59, he'd still have a life, so 27 years isn't long enough. He's totally deluded. This appeal is cruel."
She added: "With the appeal being on 23 December, there is no way that our first Christmas without Paige can be a normal one - as much as we might try to make it that way for the kids."
Ms Munro also described how Leathem appeared emotionless when she went to his shop, Delicious Deli, to talk to him about putting up posters to help to find Paige.
"Looking back, he was so cold," she told the newspaper.
"There was no emotion in his voice or his face. He never showed signs of knowing anything but I'd never have guessed."
First offender Leathem was given a mandatory life sentence at the High Court in Glasgow in October and was told he must spend at least 27 years behind bars for the "savage and frenzied" murder.
He admitted the killing at an earlier court hearing.
A post-mortem examination found that Paige suffered 61 stab wounds, mainly to her head and neck, and 85 further cuts thought to have been sustained as she tried to fight off her attacker.
Sentencing judge Lady Rae described the killing as "truly reprehensible and impossible to comprehend".

article Matt Banahan powered over early on for the hosts at The Rec - the wing's 50th try for the Blue, Black and Whites - as Bath took a 10-3 lead into the break.
Bath then struggled before Kahn Fotuali'i raced clear for a second try and Kane Palma-Newport bundled over.
Co-captain George Ford landed a 100% record from the tee as Bath closed to within a point of leaders Wasps.
Bath, who finished a disappointing ninth last season after reaching the Premiership final in 2015, have now won five of their opening six league matches.
Man-of-the-match Banahan was once again instrumental and it was the versatile 29-year-old, playing at inside centre, who gave his side a third-minute lead, slicing apart the Sale defence and powering through the final tackle to finish off a rousing attack and claim his fourth try of the season.
However, Todd Blackadder's side looked far from comfortable with ball-in-hand in the face of Sale's committed tackling either side of the break, until Samoa scrum-half Fotuali'i's 40-yard run and touch down just after the hour mark.
Bath, whose defence was rarely threatened by Sale, had 11 players unavailable including England's latest injury victim Anthony Watson, but welcomed back Jonathan Joseph from a dead leg.
The England centre impressed, making several bursting runs with international boss Eddie Jones watching on in the stands.
Jones would have also been encouraged by what he saw from the boot of fly-half Ford who nailed six kicks from six to make the final advantage bigger than the performance suggested.

article From March 2015, information from parents' payment records in England, Scotland and Wales could be shared with credit reference agencies.
Financial organisations would then use this data to decide whether or not they want to offer someone credit.
Single parent charity Gingerbread said the announcement was "very welcome".
The new powers would affect a minority of cases where "liability orders" had been granted, because parents had fallen so far in arrears the courts had had to intervene to legally recognise the debt.  But ministers hope the measures will have a deterrent effect.
Child maintenance minister Steve Webb said: "For too long, a minority of absent parents have got away with failing to pay maintenance, leaving families without that financial support.
"I would hope that we see this power used very little, because the deterrent effect of a possible negative mark on a person's credit rating will convince those who have previously failed to pay towards their children's upbringing to do the right thing."
The new powers, which will need to be approved in parliament, will also mean that parents with a good payment record can ask that this information is shared if they feel that it could boost their ability to get credit.
Fiona Weir, chief executive of Gingerbread, said children lost out when child maintenance stopped and said it was "vital" to collect what was unpaid.
She added: "More than Â£1bn is currently owed in unpaid child maintenance, and barely one in five of those who owe money for their children are paying it back."
The Child Maintenance Service was introduced in 2012 and it will eventually replace the Child Support Agency (CSA), which is gradually closing its cases over the next three years.
The CSA, set up in 1993, attracted thousands of complaints for delays and incompetence in processing child maintenance payments.

article It now expects growth this year to be 1.2%, down from its previous estimate of 1.8%. Next year, it expects the economy to grow by 1.3%, down from 2%.
A slowdown in the eurozone economy has hit German exports in recent months.
Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said there was no reason for the government to change its economic policies.
The German economy - Europe's largest - contracted by 0.2% between April and June this year, while figures released last week showed that exports fell by 5.8% in August, the largest monthly drop in five years.
These followed weak industrial output figures and recent surveys showing a fall in business confidence.
Announcing the revised growth estimates, Mr Gabriel made it clear the government believed Germany's woes were not the result of troubles at home.
"The German economy finds itself in difficult external waters," he said.
"Domestic economic forces remain intact, with the robust labour market forming the foundation.
"As soon as the international environment improves, the competitiveness of German companies will bear fruit and the German economy will return to a path of solid growth."
For this reason, Mr Gabriel said there was "no reason to abandon or change our economic or fiscal policy".
Concerns about economic growth are not limited to Germany and the eurozone.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global economic growth for this year and next, warning that the recovery was "weak and uneven".

article Judges said then children's secretary Ed Balls and her employers, Haringey Council, had been "procedurally unfair" when they sacked her three years ago.
The education department and Haringey plan to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Baby Peter Connelly, who had been seen 60 times by social services, was found dead in 2007 with over 50 injuries.
Ms Shoesmith's appeal was challenging a High Court ruling that cleared Ed Balls, the north London borough of Haringey and watchdog Ofsted, of acting unlawfully.
The Court of Appeal judges dismissed her appeal against Ofsted.
Mr Balls said he "strongly disagreed" with the judgement and added that his decision had been based on a report from independent inspectors.
Ofsted said its report on Ms Shoesmith's department, which identified "insufficient strategic leadership and management oversight", had been vindicated.
A Haringey Council spokesman said it was "deeply disappointed" by the judgement and stood by everything it had done.
In December 2008, Ms Shoesmith - originally from Newtownabbey, County Antrim - was sacked, bringing her 35-year career to an abrupt end.
By Alison HoltSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News
Sharon Shoesmith was a Director of Haringey Children's Services, a statutory role set up after the murder of Victoria Climbie more than a decade ago.
It aimed to place a line of responsibility drawn directly from the social worker visiting the child to the senior manager making decisions about the service.
There were undoubtedly serious mistakes made in the handling of Peter Connelly's case, but those mistakes were made by many of the agencies involved.
In the white heat that the case created, Sharon Shoesmith has always said she became a convenient scapegoat.
When her head rolled, it is argued, it turned scrutiny away from others, including the then Secretary of State, Ed Balls.
Many senior managers who run children's services will be very relieved by this ruling.
They claim the way in which Sharon Shoesmith was sacked did nothing to ensure people learnt from this tragedy.
She said she first heard of her dismissal when Mr Balls announced she would be removed from her post with immediate effect in a live press conference on television.
After the hearing, she said: "I'm over the moon. Absolutely thrilled.
"I am very relieved to have won my appeal and for recognition I was treated unfairly and unlawfully."
She said the sorrow of Peter's death would "stay with me for the rest of my life".
"But as the judges have said, making a 'public sacrifice' of an individual will not prevent further tragedies," she added.
At a hearing in March, Ms Shoesmith had asked Lord Neuberger, Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Lord Justice Stanley Burnton, to rule that her sacking without compensation was so legally flawed as to be null and void.
Her lawyers had argued that she was the victim of "a flagrant breach of natural justice" after she lost her Â£133,000-a-year post amid a media storm.
Ms Shoesmith also argued she was entitled to her full salary and pension from Haringey up to the present day.
'Tainted by unfairness'
In court, James Eadie QC, appearing for the government, defended Mr Balls, saying urgent action had to be taken following the "ghastly findings" of the Ofsted report.
But the judges allowed Ms Shoesmith's appeal against the former children's secretary because "the secretary of state did not afford Ms Shoesmith the opportunity to put her case".
Timeline of Baby P case
"In short, she was denied the elementary fairness which the law requires," they said.
They also rejected a submission that the situation had been too urgent to allow for a fairer procedure to be adopted.
In the case of Haringey, the judges said: "We were unanimously of the view that Haringey's procedures were tainted by unfairness."
Lawyers for Ms Shoesmith said the ruling meant she could now launch appeals against Mr Balls and Haringey Council.
The BBC's education correspondent Reeta Chakrabarti said the Court of Appeal had indicated there was no question of Ms Shoesmith returning to her position at Haringey Council.
The matter of compensation or lost earnings would need to be considered by another court, she added.
Earlier, the court heard Ms Shoesmith had not been able to find work since she was sacked, had experienced suicidal thoughts and continued to be vilified by the press.
Outside court, she said: "I would love to go back to work (in Haringey) but that's not possible. I hope to carry on with my career with children in some capacity."
In a later interview with BBC London, Ms Shoesmith said she had received death threats in the wake of the Baby Peter case that had "terrified" her.
"The police were advising me that I was probably at risk," she said. "And when people begin to take photographs of you on the trains and on the buses and point you out and start to shout, 'That's that woman,' you're fearful of where that can go."
Mr Balls said he did not "rush to judgement" because the independent inspectors' report "catalogued catastrophic management failures on such a devastating scale" that the council leader and member for children services had resigned.
"I judged, on the basis of that independent report - and on the advice of departmental officials and lawyers - that the right and responsible course of action was for me to use my statutory powers to remove the director of children's services from her position with immediate effect," he said in a statement.
He said he had been doing "what was necessary to protect the interests of children in Haringey and protect wider public confidence in child protection".
In the case of Ofsted, the judges concluded its damning report "complied with the requirements of statute and common law".
Head of Ofsted, Christine Gilbert, said she was pleased with the appeal court ruling, and added: "Ofsted carried out a robust inspection and came to a sound conclusion based on evidence.
"On any view, our inspection report was extremely critical and there has been no challenge to the finding that services for children in Haringey were inadequate."
Seventeen-month-old Baby P, subsequently named as Peter Connelly, was found to have suffered fractured ribs and a broken back after months of abuse at home. His mother, her partner and a lodger were all jailed for causing or allowing his death in August 2007.
Peter had been seen by health and social services professionals from Haringey council 60 times in the eight months before he died.

article On Monday a man was beaten with metal bars and a wheelie bin set alight in an attack at a house in the Creggan area of Londonderry. Police have also linked Loyalist paramilitaries to a series of attacks in Coleraine and north Antrim.
ACC Stephen Martin told BBC Radio Foyle that community support is key to getting successful convictions.
"Often the person who is the victim and indeed witnesses won't cooperate with us."
"We understand the reasons, people are frightened, people feel intimidated, but without that cooperation of the victim it makes a prosecution virtually impossible," he said.
"If people come forward and tell us what they know we have shown ourselves very capable in a whole range of crimes of putting people before the court and securing a conviction but this is a difficult issue."
Responding to questions about a paramilitary-style attack in Derry, Mr Martin said the attack was nothing new to Northern Ireland.
"This was being done during 40 years of troubles and it doesn't work, it never worked all it does is brutalise people. Inflict injuries and turn families on families," he said.
"I don't think they're capable of acting with impunity but unfortunately they are able to carry these crimes much more frequently than any of us would wish.
"I would say to people that if they have concerns about any issues in the community there is only one place to turn to and that's the police."

article But its most revered residents of all are the ones that shun the five-star facilities and never ever pick up a tab.
The exclusive isle - off the north coast of Antigua and Barbuda - is the site of the world's longest running research programme for critically endangered hawksbill turtles.
And they have been here far longer than their human counterparts.
Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the study, funded entirely by Jumby Bay's well-heeled homeowners who include the likes of Lord Sainsbury, the former chair of the eponymous British supermarket chain, and author Ken Follett.
It has collated more data than any other project about the intriguing creatures which were previously considered too skittish to study, and is one of the only places in the world where their numbers are increasing.
The last three decades have seen almost 450 hawksbills tagged for monitoring purposes and the number of those nesting there increase three-fold.
Every single turtle laying eggs on the island's Pasture Beach is identified thanks to meticulous hourly patrols by researchers and volunteers every night for the duration of the five-and-a-half-month annual nesting season.
Dr Seth Stapleton, from the University of Minnesota who is overseeing the work, said 2014 had been a record year with nearly 90 hawksbills spotted.
"When the project started there were about 30 individuals nesting per season. What's even more remarkable is that we are continuing to see some of the same turtles that were first tagged in the late 1980s returning to nest here. They were originally tagged when they were probably 15 to 20 years old, and a few are still reproducing decades later."
Long hunted for their beautiful brown and gold shells - used to make everything from sunglasses to jewellery - the population of hawksbills worldwide has declined by 80% in the last 200 years.
They have been listed as critically endangered since 1996.
Although the trade is now banned, they still face horrendous odds with only one in 1,000 hatchlings making it to adulthood thanks to omnipresent marine predators.
Exacerbating matters further is hawksbills' late maturation; they do not usually begin to reproduce until they are at least 15 years old.
Dr Stapleton said the Jumby Bay study had been integral in providing fundamental information about hawksbills.
"Many details we now take for granted we learned there - for example, that they don't nest every year; they nest four or five times in one year, laying around 150 eggs each time and then skip a year or two," he explained.
"But there's still so much we don't know, such as how long they live. My ballpark guess would be 50 to 60."
Because turtles are tagged when in their so-called 'nesting trance' - a daze-like state during the egg-laying process when they are oblivious to their surroundings and unable to move quickly - most of the data gathered is about adult females.
Researchers are now taking genetic tissue from the hatchlings to compile information about the males, too.
Plans for the upcoming year also include deploying three satellite transmitters to track hawksbills' movements by GPS.
"This will enable us to better assess where they travel after nesting," Dr Stapleton added.
Hawksbills play a key environmental role by eating sponges which helps keep coral reefs healthy.
Ashton Williams, of Antigua's Environmental Awareness Group (EAG), said sadly a small number of turtles were still poached for their meat on the mainland.
"We were following tracks recently at Rendezvous Bay when the marks suddenly stopped. We could see where a turtle had been flipped over and dragged away," he said.
"Thankfully the younger generation aren't that interested in turtle meat but some of the older folk still have a taste for it. There's also a myth that the eggs are an aphrodisiac."
Mr Williams has been working to protect Antigua's marine life for the last 35 years.
"What I love most about turtles is their determination. The female leaves her environment and puts herself in so much danger all for the survival of her offspring," he said.
"When she goes into her nesting trance she's totally vulnerable to predators. To go through all that just to be killed by a man, it really hurts."
Happily for Jumby Bay's reptilian population, the private isle is one of the world's densest hawksbill nesting sites with one every two to three metres.
Donna Cook, the resort's spokeswoman, said the scheme would not be possible without the generosity of private homeowners.
"It's an amazing project," she added. "The island is one of the few places on earth where turtles are completely safe."

article Nine banks, including Barclays and Goldman Sachs, may adopt the blockchain system that logs who spends which virtual coins in an ever-expanding computer equivalent of a ledger.
The banks want to use the blockchain method because it is hard to fool - making fraud more difficult.
It could also speed up trading systems and make deals more transparent.
The project to test blockchain-like technology is being led by financial technology firm R3 which has signed nine banks up to the initiative.
The other seven are JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, BBVA and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
Technical meetings with the banks had prompted discussion of how it could be used within banks' trading arms, said David Rutter, head of R3 in an interview with Reuters.
For Bitcoin, the blockchain acts as a globally-distributed ledger that logs transactions. Everyone involved with the virtual currency contributes to the way the blockchain verifies each deal. The sheer number of people involved makes it very hard for one bitcoin user to get fraudulent deals verified and approved.
Despite this, Bitcoin has been hit by a series of scandals and thefts although most of these came about because hackers exploited weaknesses on exchanges where coins are traded or in digital wallets where they are held.
Mr Rutter said the banks were most interested in the technical architecture underpinning the blockchain that could be adapted for their own ends. The first place the blockchain was likely to find a role was as a log of who bought which stocks or shares, he said.
By adopting the technology banks could cut the cost of reporting transactions and working out who bought what and when, he added.
No timetable has been given for when technical trials of the blockchain-like technology might begin.
summary The first banks to use the blockchain technology to track their customers' spending has been announced.

It crashed through trees and down into an embankment.
One of the teenagers died at the scene and the other was taken to Altnagelvin hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later.
Buncrana priest Fr Francis Bradley spoke to the families of the teenagers who died.
"Both Nathans were part of a wide circle of friends who often socialised together," he said.
"The families were telling me last night of how they had booked to go away for a short break together.

article The Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) has found some of the characters in the Cairngorms.
The organisation said the game, which is played via a phone app, offered a good way for people to enjoy the outdoors.
However, it added that gamers should be aware of the potential hazards associated with hillwalking.
Pokémon Go sees players search for digital creatures in real-life locations.
Heather Morning, MCofS mountain safety adviser, said: "From a mountain safety perspective there are clearly a few issues here.
"It is not difficult to imagine a situation where a Pokémon Go gamer finds themselves lost and unable to find their way back to safety.
"It would be equally easy to see how someone could put themselves into danger focusing on their game rather than focusing on the ground in front of them."
She added: "Another aspect of Pokémon Go is the game's ability to eat your battery life. All the biggest battery-eating culprits are in action, and your screen is the biggest battery hog.
"On top of that, you will be using your camera, so that you can see the Pokémon in the real world. And to top it all off, the ever hungry GPS is a must to find the Pokémon in the first place.  A classic combo for a dead phone very quickly.
"If your phone is your only tool for navigating your way out of wherever you have found yourself, then you are in for trouble."
Ms Morning has come across some of the digital creatures while on a trek in the Cairngorms.
She said: "It's a fun game, and it does encourage folk to get out and about and enjoy the great outdoors with all the health benefits that brings.
"However, gamers need to be aware if they are playing in an area that they are not familiar with - particularly in the mountains - that they should very much stay 'switched on' to where they are and how to get themselves home safely."

The cost of sending a second class medium parcel would drop, Royal Mail said, and a price cut for second-class small parcels that was introduced as a Christmas promotion will continue.
From 30 March, second class medium parcels weighing up to 2kg will be priced at Â£4.89, which Royal Mail said represented a saving of up to Â£3.11.

Welsh Conservative leader and Leave supporter Andrew RT Davies said Welsh politics had changed forever but Labour's Lord Hain said there would be "tragic" consequences.
David Cameron announced he would step down as prime minister by October.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said he fears jobs will be lost in Wales following the vote outcome and called for party and public unity in Wales.
Get the results in full.
In a statement in Downing Street he said he would attempt to "steady the ship" between now and then.
"We must now prepare for a negotiation with the European Union - this will need to involve the full engagement of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments to ensure that the interests of all parts of our United Kingdom are protected and advanced," Mr Cameron said.
The vast bulk of Wales' council areas, many of them Labour-supporting, voted for Leave with a majority in 17 backing Brexit.
Only five areas - Gwynedd, Cardiff, Ceredigion, the Vale of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire - voted for Remain.
Turnout was high at 71.7% for Wales.

Neil Hamilton, UKIP's assembly group leader, said: "I am absolutely delighted and I have to admit even a little surprised myself, as I hardly dared believe we could achieve this."
UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill told BBC Radio's Good Morning Wales: "It is wonderful, we [all UK MEPs] will be given our P45s now.
"It is the 74 MEPs not the British people who are going to lose their jobs."
He said he was not surprised Wales voted to leave and said he had been predicting the outcome for a long time.
"Everywhere we have been for two to three years, our support has been galvanising," he said.
"People have been telling us they are fed up of the EU, saying it wasn't democratic, saying 'we want our freedom back' and that is what they are going to get."
Andrew RT Davies said: "It is clear that the fault lines of Welsh politics have now changed forever, and I am extremely proud to have been involved in this campaign."
He told Good Morning Wales that Wales will receive more investment outside the European Union.
He added: "I stood by my convictions [backing a leave vote] and stood by my beliefs. We have a great future ahead of us as we are a great trading nation."
As Leave campaigners celebrated their historic victory, leading figures from the Remain side lined up to warn of "very serious" and "dangerous" consequences from the decision.
Lord Hain said: "It is a tragic result for Wales which will have serious consequences for us."
Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Wales, he said: "What leave voters will find is that they will be pleased in the short-term but in the long-term, the consequences are very serious.  Those that voted leave are the ones that benefit most from EU funding."
He said the EU had become "the whipping boy", with "immigration becoming a toxic issue, even in areas where there has been no immigration".
With the potential for Scotland to call another independence referendum, he said: "We could have moved out of one union and lost another in the UK."
He said serious questions must be asked about whether the Welsh Government's planned M4 relief road and South Wales Metro project would now happen.
Simon Thomas, a Plaid Cymru AM whose party supported Remain, told BBC Wales he was extremely disappointed.
"I think its an absolute disaster from the point of view of building the Welsh economy over the next five to ten years," he said.
"This is very dangerous and disturbing territory that we're entering into."
His fellow Plaid AM Rhun ap Iorwerth called the Leave vote a "hammer blow to Wales economically" warning "the poorest will pay the price".
"We have woken up in a deep pit that we have dug ourselves with spades provided by a fear-driven campaign," he said.
Mark Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said he was deeply disappointed, adding: "Now is not the time for more government infighting at the expense of the people of Wales."
Labour AM and ex-MEP Baroness Morgan said: "That crash in the market you hear is also the crashing of your pensions. This will impact on everyone."
Work and Pensions Secretary and former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he was "not surprised" by the results in Wales and voters had not trusted the messages from the Remain campaign.
He said voters said they were "sorry we don't believe what the Labour party and the government are saying about the benefits of the European Union".
First Minister Carwyn Jones is due to give a press conference at 09:15 BST.
Political commentator Daran Hill said: "Wales' decision to Leave comes down to a failure of Labour and the Labour-inclined Stronger In campaign to connect with, motivate and mobilise their voters.
"The Welsh voters have done what they haven't done since 1979 - they have rejected the establishment."
Live coverage of the results and reaction continues on BBC One Wales, on BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru.
We have seen a very surprising pattern. We have seen working class Labour voters go fairly solidly "Vote Leave", far more strongly than we were expecting.
Leave won Bridgend - which is First Minister Carwyn Jones' territory - and they won Rhondda Cynon Taff, which is Leanne Wood's home territory.
So maybe it is not the individual politicians we should be looking at - it is actually a question of income and social class more than political affiliation or political leadership.
Are we looking at a situation where people who felt they have had nothing to lose voted to leave, whereas people who feel they have something to lose - Labour or Conservative - decided to vote remain?
It seems to me that there is an income and class distribution question far more than there is a political one.
David Cameron and George Osborne's big scare campaign did not work and there were issues over the timing of the referendum.
Because of the assembly election campaign, you only saw Carwyn Jones and Leanne Wood together three days before the vote took place.
That was far too late to turn their popularity into persuading people to vote to Remain.

article President Hollande of France, who hosted the summit, said regional powers had pledged to share intelligence and co-ordinate action against the group.
Last month it abducted 223 schoolgirls in north-eastern Nigeria, where it is based. Fresh attacks were reported in Nigeria and Cameroon overnight.
Thousands of people have been killed by Boko Haram in recent years.
The Paris summit brought together President Francois Hollande, Nigeria's Goodluck Jonathan, and their counterparts from Benin, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.
Afterwards, Mr Hollande said participants had agreed on a "global and regional action plan".
He said this involved "co-ordinating intelligence, sharing information... border surveillance, a military presence notably around Lake Chad and the capacity to intervene in case of danger".
Cameroon's President Paul Biya said: "We are here to declare war on Boko Haram". Idriss Deby of Chad said it would be "total war".
Earlier, Mr Hollande called Boko Haram a "major threat to West and Central Africa", and said it had links with al-Qaeda's North-African arm and "other terrorist organisations".
BBC's International Development Correspondent Mark Doyle says the group is an international threat, drawing fighters from not just Nigeria but also from neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Chad.
In the latest violence, suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a camp run by a Chinese engineering company in the far north of Cameroon, near Nigeria's north-eastern border.
Ten Chinese workers are believed to have been abducted. One Cameroonian soldier was killed, officials say.
In Nigeria itself, 11 people were reported killed in a separate attack on a village a few hours' drive from the Cameroonian border.
A relative of one of the victims said a woman and a child were among the dead.
Representatives from the UK, US and EU also took part in the Paris meeting.
Before it began, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said regional powers needed to co-operate better when it came to cross-border intelligence.
Boko Haram has some of its bases in the Mandara mountain range that straddles the border. But the long frontier has been disputed in at least two places in recent years.
The abducted schoolgirls, who include Christians and Muslims, were seized on 14 April in the north-east Nigerian town of Chibok in Borno state.
Mr Jonathan was due on Friday to visit the town but the trip was cancelled for security reasons.
Boko Haram released a video earlier this week showing more than 100 of the girls and offering an exchange for prisoners.
President Jonathan has ruled out negotiations over their possible release, officials say.

article The so-called ghost gear is a danger to seals and other marine mammals which get entangled in the mesh, the Cornwall Seal Group said.
Fifty-two creatures including seals, birds, crabs and fish were found tangled in nets in a year-long survey.
Fishermen said they collect hundreds of tonnes of discarded items every year.
More on the 'ghost fishing gear' being a threat to seals, and other news from Devon and Cornwall
Between November 2014 and October 2015, Cornwall Seal Group members surveyed ghost gear washed up on the beaches around Cornwall and parts of Devon and the Isles of Scilly.
They collected a total of 4,226 items, weighing 51 tonnes.
Christina Dixon, campaign manager at World Animal Protection, which commissioned the survey, said: "While this research was being conducted we saw lobster pot tags travelling 3,000 miles from Newfoundland to Shetland and pieces of gear hitching a ride on the Gulf Stream from Canada to Cornwall.
"Ghost gear is a trans-boundary problem and it's essential efforts to address it are undertaken collaboratively across countries."
Jim Portus, of the South West Fish Producers Organisation, said: "Fishermen do not like losing gear because it costs a lot of money, but they are working in a dynamic environment so it does get lost.
"I share the concerns of all people about this and the effect it has on the environment."
Fishermen collect hundreds of tonnes of ghost gear every year as part of the Fishing For Litter project, which is supported by the industry.
"We all need to contribute to the process of cleaning up our seas and beaches and I have a lot of sympathy with people raising concerns about the affect of lost gear," Mr Portus said.

article In a video, it promised journey times of 12 minutes between the two cities.
The technology is still in testing phase so details of the deal were sketchy.
Initially, it will explore the feasibility of building a line linking the two cities.
Hyperloop was originally  an idea from Tesla's boss and tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who conceived the technical details of the transport system but left it to commercial firms to make the vision a reality.
The high-speed transportation system would use electric propulsion to accelerate a passenger or cargo pod through a low-pressure tube at speeds of up to 700mph. The vehicle would levitate above the track, which is likely to be built on stilts above the ground.
There are currently two main firms attempting to make it a reality - Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Hyperloop One.
Hyperloop One, which hosted its Dubai announcement at the top of the world's tallest building - the Burj Khalifa - has signed a feasibility deal with the emirate's roads and transportation agency.
It will explore the possibility of using the technology at Dubai's Jebel Ali port.
Journey times between Dubai and Abu Dhabi are currently an hour or more.
It suggested that the system could also be used to cut journey times from Dubai to Riyadh to 48 minutes and from Dubai to Doha to 23 minutes.
Rival Hyperloop firm HTT signed a deal in March to bring its technology to Slovakia, aiming to link Bratislava with Vienna and Budapest.
The team at Hyperloop One is expected to unveil the first glimpse of what the transportation pods will look like soon.
Prof David Bailey, from the Aston Business School, said the plan in the United Arab Emirates was "more feasible" than previous announcements to use Hyperloop to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco.
"Building it through the desert means you can plan a route that is straight - it doesn't do curves very well - and the government there will see it as a way to be at the forefront of a new technology," he told the BBC.
But he added there remained a lot of "technical and other hurdles" to overcome, not least whether people would want to travel at such high speeds and in such a manner.

article Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock all auditioned for the show as solo artists, but were asked to form a group by the judges, including their mentor Tulisa Contostavlos.
Their debut single, a cover of Damien Rice's Cannonball, topped the charts last December, although it missed out on the coveted Christmas number one spot.
Now, the quartet are gearing up to release their first "proper" single, Wings - a funky pop record with a Disney-fied message about believing in yourself.
Perrie and Leigh-Anne spoke to the BBC about leaving X Factor behind, writing their debut album, and Perrie's unconventional diet of dog biscuits.
Hello, Little Mix! How are you?
Perrie: Hi - we're very well, thank you!
You've just come back from performing at an X Factor launch event. How was that?
Leigh-Anne: It was actually really nerve-wracking. I reckon we work better in front of big crowds. When we did Party in the Park it was in front of 70,000 people and that was amazing. But with smaller crowds, you can see everyone looking at you. We're like "eeeee!"
I noticed people were taping the gig on their phones. Will you look up the footage on YouTube later?
Perrie: Yeah, we like to look at videos now and again to see what we're doing wrong. We make notes.
What's the biggest problem you've spotted?
Perrie: When we're dancing and we're doing "the arms", sometimes someone's arms will be higher and someone else's arms will be too low. So we try to get it perfect. We practise in mirrors all the time.
You should attach your arms to strings, like puppets.
Perrie: Yes! And get someone else to do all the work for us. That would be so funny.
This time last year, the first episode of X Factor was about to go out. Had you told people you'd be in it?
Perrie: I didn't tell anyone that I'd even auditioned. I kept it secret. I was scared in case anyone thought "ugh, why is she trying to get on the X Factor, is she crazy?". So it was all hush-hush. Every time I got phoned by the X Factor, I'd tell people it was about a job interview!
Is it true that you were initially reluctant to become a group?
Leigh-Anne: Me, Jesy and Jade were all told at our first audition that they could see us in a girl group. All of us were a little bit disappointed because they thought we weren't good enough on our own.
It's notoriously hard to make four voices blend and harmonise. How did you work it all out so quickly at boot camp?
Perrie: We've all got a good ear for sound and music. And we practice over and over, then we record it on our phones so that when we go to sleep we can listen to it in bed.
Leigh-Anne: I honestly think it was fate. The moment we stepped onto the stage at boot camp, and we performed together for the first time as a group, I looked around and thought "this is what I've been missing all my life". It sounds cheesy but it's true.
Will you watch the X Factor this year?
Leigh-Anne: We watched a little bit of it today at the press launch and it's a little bit upsetting because it's not our show any more. We're not going to be the winners much longer.
But you can't really watch it in the same way any more, because you know all the little things that go on backstage.
The band has been vocal about standing up to bullies, and the single reinforces that message. How important were the lyrics to you?
Leigh-Anne: We've all been through it and we wanted to write something that people who've experienced it can relate to. But also, we didn't want it to be cheesy. We wanted to be clever with the lyrics. The line "mama told me not to waste my time" was really important. It's not us preaching. I think we've done it in quite a cool way.
It's unusual for X Factor stars to co-write their singles...
Perrie: More than anything, we wanted to be involved in the writing and the production. I've always loved rock music. My dad brought me up listening to Journey, Aerosmith and Guns N' Roses. Then, on my mum's side of the family, I was into Motown. So when we started writing, we all had different tastes in different genres of music but we tried to blend it all together.  At the end of the day, it's our name on it. If we're not happy, then I think people will see straight through it.
Leigh-Anne: On the album, there are some songs where we've literally done everything - melody and lyrics. We've got so much to say and so much to write about.
You'd both written music before Little Mix. Perrie, did your song Beautiful Summer make it onto the album?
Perrie: [Shrieks] Oh my God! How did you know about that song? No, it didn't make it onto the album… I didn't even put it forward. It's not very Little Mix. It's very indie, it was just me with my acoustic guitar writing songs when I was younger.
Do you at least get to play guitar on the record?
Perrie: You know, I honestly haven't had the chance. Since X Factor, I haven't played my guitar at all. It's so upsetting. My fingers aren't scabby any more. I'm bad. I'm a bad guitarist.
When you're recording, do you all stand round the microphone and sing in unison?
Perrie: Sometimes you go in there to do your solo vocal and belt stuff out. It's nice to focus and get it done. But when we're doing the group harmonies and the little quirky bits, it's good to go in together because we feed off each other.
Have you ever gone for a big note and shattered the glass?
Perrie: No, but every time I go into the studio I'll be like, "what does this button do?" and "if I slide this fader up here what happens?" There'll be a dozen people shouting at me, "no, no, no!"
As well as the album, you've got a book and a whole load of merchandise coming out. Do you need those things because you can't make money from record sales anymore?
Leigh-Anne: It's not anything like that, I don't think. It's more "if you can, then why not?". We're even getting our own dolls. We've been sent the mock-ups of them, and they're all bald! When it's finished, mine will have a big afro. We can't wait to start dressing them up.
And drawing moustaches on them…
Leigh-Anne: Haha! I just can't wait to have them in my room.
What's Little Mix's secret formula?
Leigh-Anne: We're very approachable. We are four normal, silly, weird girls. We want people to feel like they can come up to us and have a chat. We're like your friends.
Except my friends don't eat dog biscuits...
Perrie: I just want to clarify that this was one time! This story has just got out of hand. I've eaten one dog biscuit in my life, but who hasn't eaten a dog biscuit? It's not like I ate the sloppy, gravy stuff. It was a Scooby Snack.
Wings will be released on 25 August. Little Mix's debut album follows later this year.

article Sir Howard, who has worked for the authority since joining as a junior clerk in 1971, will stand down in the spring of 2017.
Occupying his current post since 1998, he is widely credited with inspiring the regeneration of Manchester following the IRA bomb blast in 1996.
The council said the search for his successor will begin shortly.
Sir Howard oversaw Manchester's hosting of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the launch of the Metrolink transport system and the region's devolution project.
He was also involved in the establishment of Manchester Airport as a PLC in the mid 1980s and the hub's ongoing expansion.
Sir Howard, who was knighted in 2003 for services to the city, said it had been a "privilege to serve the city during such a pivotal period".
"I'm incredibly proud of what the city has been able to achieve in this time, and to have played a part in it," he said.
"Manchester is firmly established as a confident and dynamic place, recognised as a premier league world city, although of course there are still significant challenges to address."
"I will have been at the council 46 years next year, and this feels like the right time to plan for my succession."
Council leader Sir Richard Leese said: "Sir Howard is widely recognised as one of the great local government chief executives. Having someone of his talent, vision and drive dedicate his career to the city has been an undoubted plus for Manchester.
"Working with him over many years, addressing challenges and attempting to capture opportunities for the city, has been a pleasure. He will be a hard act to follow."

article On Sunday morning, as 32-year-old Wiggins was preparing to ride his way into the sporting record books by becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France, almost the entire village started toasting his win early.
There was a carnival atmosphere as the Original Farmers Arms pub put the finishing touches to a celebration party in his honour.
As the sun beamed down, the party appeared to be already in full swing, with people dressed in cycling gear and waving union jacks.
Coincidently, the cycling leg of the Ironman UK competition was also going through the village, with people lining the streets to cheer on competitors.
Mr Newton said it was a "double whammy" celebration as cycling enthusiasts gathered for the competition and to support their local hero.
In another pub down the road, The Windmill, a regular had turned the outside wall into a mural in honour of the village's most famous resident.
Artist and villager Barry Woods painted the mural, which depicts Wiggins on his bike in the Tour de France.
Della Ross, landlady of the pub, said: "We got an anonymous note through the pub door a couple of weeks ago asking us to do it.
"We still don't know whose idea it was and who posted the note."
Mr Woods said: "I hope he [Wiggins] likes it. I can't believe the attention that it's got.
"I've got so much admiration for what he's achieved and proud to have done a welcome home present.
"Just wish I knew who suggested this."
Former amateur cyclist Julian Hules said: "I have followed every minute of his progress and this is the biggest thing that has ever happened to Eccleston."
Sporting a GB Olympic T-shirt and clutching a union jack, he said the whole of Eccleston was thrilled at his achievement.
"Not just for the village, but for Great Britain," he added.
"He has been superb. Not only has he won Olympic gold medals and the Tour de France but he has done it clean, he is a gentleman and true ambassador.
"When I last saw him, I told him about watching him fall off his bike and break his collarbone in last year's Tour de France from my hospital bed in intensive care after an operation for bowel cancer.
"I told him he looked worse than me and he laughed about it."
Young and old had turned out to party and as Wiggins neared the finish line, the noise inside the pub got louder as villagers chanted "Wiggo, Wiggo, Wiggo".
Simon Thomson, whose six-month-old daughter Elsa was wearing a T-shirt with the slogan "Team Wiggins Tour de France Coming Home to Eccleston", said: "It's amazing what Bradley Wiggins has done in the ultimate endurance test.
"It's a major boost to UK cycling and it makes me want to get my mountain bike out."
Nick Braithwaite, who works in a cycling shop in Leyland where Wiggins is a regular, said he had cycled five miles to Eccleston to join in the celebrations.
He said he was "emotional" when he crossed the line and sealed victory.
Sam Harrison, 11, said: "It was fantastic. He was under a lot of pressure as well because everyone expected him to win."
The restaurant manager at Original Farmers Arms, Lisa Griffin, said Wiggins and his wife came into the pub for meals. She described him as "so polite and unassuming".
"His wife came in a couple of days ago when she heard we were going to hold a party in his honour today and she offered to pay for it, which is a lovely gesture," she said.
"She said she would call in when they get back to thank everybody for their support."
summary Britain's Bradley Wiggins was a man of few words.

article The home side reclaimed second place in the table by bowling out Sussex for 356 during the final afternoon.
Vernon Philander (73 not out) and Michael Burgess (68) both batted well in a losing cause.
The end came when James Harris (4-103) had Danny Briggs lbw as Kent climbed to within four points of leaders Notts.
Facing a target of 504, it seemed likely that the game would be concluded in the morning after Sussex struggled to 182-6 at the end of day three.
However, Burgess and David Wiese (32) extended their partnership to 51 before Harris knocked out the latter's off stump.
Burgess was dropped by Will Gidman off Matt Coles as he added 52 with Philander, before the bowler had his revenge by trapping him leg-before.
Harris removed Jofra Archer for 27 after a rain shower briefly held up the post-lunch resumption of play.
After reaching a 69-ball fifty, Philander celebrated with three successive fours off Harris, but the on-loan paceman dismissed Briggs for 18 for match figures of 7-140.
Sussex skipper Luke Wright told BBC Sussex: "We were up against a good Kent side who've started really well in this competition.
"The way that Stevo (Darren Stevens) bowled in the first innings really set up the game for them; he bowled outstandingly well, got it to do a lot.
"I thought we bowled well but we didn't get the nicks and they did, we beat the bat so many times but they got 300 and we seemed to nick everything when we batted.
"We just haven't had enough big scores, and that's what we did so well in the last game against Durham. It was annoying, especially in the first innings, and that put us massively behind in the game."

article David Kingston, 38, of Hertfordshire, resigned from St Lawrence Roman Catholic Primary in Hounslow in 2014.
A National College for Teaching conduct panel heard he admitted having viewed images depicting bestiality.
He was found not guilty of expressing a sexual interest in children online after the panel heard it was "unclear" who had made the posts.
Mr Kingston, who began work at the school in 2002, told the panel he had not actively searched for images depicting sexual activity involving a person and an animal.
"I did not actively access these images," he said, "but simply tolerated them upon being shown to me."
It was, he told the panel, his partner at the time who had searched for the images.
However, the panel's recommendation that he not face a prohibition order was overturned by the secretary of state.
While the panel said Mr Kingston was "a passive participant" and the incident "did not involve any pupils" the secretary of state found the panel had "not taken sufficient account of the public concern" the case would arouse.
A two-year ban was imposed.

article Mole Valley District Council is consulting on plans to move boundaries to allow the building of up to 2,200 homes over the next 13 years.
The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) has now started a campaign called Save Surrey's Countryside.
The council said there was insufficient land available in built-up areas for new homes and other development.
Andy Smith, from the Surrey branch of the CPRE, said the group was concerned about development around places like Guildford, Reigate and Leatherhead.
"These areas have been built and built over the years," he said.
"All these towns have expanded to such an extent we have to say enough is enough."
Mole Valley District Council said it was is looking at green belt land around the area's towns and larger villages to see if there was potential for development.
John Northcott, the councillor responsible for planning, said: "This consultation document does not identify sites for development or suggest land that could be taken out of the green belt.
"Instead it sets out a process for reviewing the green belt boundary and we will use the findings of the consultation to help shape our future work."

article More than a million civil servants began an indefinite strike on Wednesday, calling for higher wages.
Earlier, police fired rubber bullets and water cannon at crowds of strikers protesting outside a Soweto hospital.
Military doctors, nurses and soldiers have been deployed to three out of South Africa's nine provinces.
More unions joined in on the second day of industrial action.
Gauteng province's health minister said they were investigating whether the deaths overnight of five people in a hospital east of Johannesburg were linked to staff shortages because of the strike.
Unions affiliated with Cosatu, South Africa's main union federation, have been holding out for an 8.6% pay rise.
But South Africa's government says it can barely afford the 7% offer it has put on the table for the police, teachers, doctors and nurses.
President Jacob Zuma has condemned the union's threat of violence against non-striking workers and said the government reserved the right to fire the strikers.
"If you declare a strike in that manner and you can't sit for a year without the kids going to school," he is quoted by the South African Broadcasting Corporation as saying.
"If the time goes, it means the government will have to take other actions."
"The [SA National Defence Force] has been instructed to render support to any government department that may require assistance during the public service strike," South Africa Press Association quoted defence ministry spokesman Ndivhuwo Wa Ha Mabaya as saying.
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Johannesburg says the conditions at South Africa's hospitals have been causing the most concern to the authorities.
Many health workers who are not taking part in the strike have found themselves targeted by union members, he says.
Access to hospitals has been blocked - and on several occasions those on strike have gone into wards and dragged nurses away from their patients, our correspondent says.
Military armoured vehicles have been now deployed inside some hospital premises.
When rowdy strikers in Soweto stopped patients from entering the hospital grounds on Thursday morning, the police - forbidden by law from joining the strike - moved in.
Police spokeswoman Captain Nondumiso Mpantsha said the protesters were also trying to force their way in to picket inside the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital.
"Police had to use minimum force and fire rubber bullets to disperse the crowd... there is a heavy police presence at the scene," she told the BBC
Johannesburg's Eyewitness news website reported that a police helicopter was flying over the city's main Helen Joseph Hospital.
There have also been reports of intimidation at schools and teachers have threatened to disrupt classes at private schools.
But police stopped protesters planning to block one of the busiest motorways in Johannesburg on Thursday.

article The vote came during a council meeting despite a demonstration outside by campaigners fighting to prevent the Kent airport's redevelopment.
Thanet District Council was considering a report which recommended no further action be taken on the site.
Proposals could now be sent to the transport secretary for consideration.
Earlier this week, Stephen DeNardo, chief executive of the US firm RiverOak Investments, which expressed an interest in buying the airport, said he was disappointed over the plans to drop the compulsory purchase order.
Manston was sold to regeneration specialists in September, which will see the former airport redeveloped for manufacturing, housing and schools.
Two local Conservative MPs earlier met a government minister to discuss the site's future.
Roger Gale and Laura Sandys held a private meeting with transport minister John Hayes.

The original estimate was for $50bn, which was increased to $100bn three years later.
The nuclear meltdown at Fukushima was triggered by an earthquake and tsunami.
The powerful quake and waves that followed left more than 18,000 people dead, tens of thousands more displaced and well over a million buildings destroyed or damaged.
Almost 4,000 roads, 78 bridges and 29 railways were also affected.
The majority of the money will go towards compensation, with decontamination taking the next biggest slice.
Storing the contaminated soil and decommissioning are the two next greatest costs.
The compensation pot has been increased by about 50% and decontamination estimates have been almost doubled.
The BBC's Japan correspondent, Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, says it is still unclear who is going to pay for the clean up.
Japan's government has long promised that Tokyo Electric Power, the company that owns the plant, will eventually pay the money back.
But on Monday it admitted that electricity consumers would be forced to pay a portion of the clean up costs through higher electricity bills.
Critics say this is effectively a tax on the public to pay the debt of a private electricity utility.
The fault that caused the earthquake and tsunami is still causing trouble.
Last week, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake hit Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures. Japan's scientists said this was a strong aftershock of the massive 2011 quake.
This time, Japan escaped with only a few reports of minor injuries, and tsunami waves of over 1m.

article The Northern Ireland Executive's voluntary exit scheme opened in 2015.
The spending watchdog has reported that 4,383 posts were axed in year one, with more than half the redundancies within the Civil Service.
While redundancy payments to staff totalled £171m, the report said they will result in annual savings of £155m.
The average cost of compensation ranged from £16,000 in NI Water to £58,000 in Libraries NI.
Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said the Department of Finance ran the scheme "in a way which was consistent with value for money".
However he added that over time "it will be important to demonstrate" savings have been sustained.
Mr Donnelly also said the scheme should be monitored going forward, so as not to have "a negative impact on staff skills, morale and service delivery".
The Northern Ireland Executive intends borrowing up to £700m over four years to reduce the size and cost of the local public sector.
The Audit Office said it was "a significant achievement" to deliver the cuts so quickly.

article GPs and health planners are waiting to hear if the Welsh government will back their calls to help areas which have recruitment problems.
But Prof John Bligh, head of Cardiff University's school of medicine, said incentives had variable results.
A health board executive director for primary care said it was not the "golden bullet answer".
Hywel Dda University Health Board recently stepped in to directly manage two GP practices after they struggled to replace retiring doctors.
Catherine Davies, from the health board, said: "It's about offering career development. We want to attract the brightest, the best, the most driven.
"While it (incentives) is a helpful tool to have, it's by no means the golden bullet answer."
Prof Bligh added: "I would much rather doctors chose to work in an area because that's where they wanted to work, as opposed to having a debt reduction scheme or some similar process."
Over the last decade, the number of GPs in Wales increased by 10% to a total of 2,006, but that population is ageing and many family doctors are finding an increasing workload oppressive.
Dr Paul Myers, of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said: "I speak to a lot of GPs in the latter part of their career who say they can't wait to finish."
The British Medical Association has estimated Wales needs to be recruiting at least 200 trainee GPs a year to replace those retiring or going part-time.
But most years the current quota of 136 training places has not been filled.
Dr Ruth Hussey, chief medical officer for Wales, accepted there were pockets of Wales where recruiting GPs was challenging.
Ministers will publish a primary care workforce plan later this month which, Dr Hussey said, will look at overcoming the challenges to building a sustainable workforce and allow consultation on "what might work".

article A regional breakdown of installations published by the Stephen Nolan Show on Radio Ulster shows the biggest cluster is around Dungannon, County Tyrone.
There are 342 boilers there - about one-in-six of the total.
The statistics show the total of 2,128 recipients are split roughly between commercial and farming interests.
Around Ballymena and Ballymoney there are 276 boilers.
Poultry farmers are heavily represented, accounting for 871 of the installations.
The two main clusters are close to Moy Park's processing plants in Northern Ireland, in Ballymena and Dungannon.
Poultry farmers use the boilers to heat chicken houses where the birds are reared.
Many switched from LPG gas to biomass in recent years.
Other areas where there are significant numbers of boilers by postcode include Armagh which has 112 and Omagh which has 82.
Last week, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said a Moy Park briefing with his officials had raised "issues" about the operation of the RHI scheme.
Moy Park later issued a statement but made no reference to those issues.
On Monday, the former DETI minister Jonathan Bell claimed under assembly privilege that he had been told DUP special advisers Timothy Johnston and John Robinson had extensive interests in the poultry industry, and that he would not be allowed to reduce the RHI tariff as a result.
The DUP later issued a statement of categorical denial on behalf of both men.
John Robinson said he had "no personal interest" in the poultry industry. He said two of his brothers were poultry farmers but were not in the RHI.
Timothy Johnston said he had "no family connections to the poultry industry". He said he had two brothers in law in the poultry industry but neither had any connection with the RHI.
On Tuesday, Mr Bell said he was prepared to repeat allegations he made about the role played by special advisers in the RHI scheme, to a judge-led inquiry.
He was speaking during an an opposition debate in the Assembly calling for a public inquiry into the controversial scheme.
He also made further allegations about the RHI scheme - suggesting at least one DUP special adviser might have up to eight boilers. The party said it was an "outrageous claim".
MLAs later voted for a public inquiry to be called into the controversy in a debate where Sinn Féin were absent.
The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to help to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources.
But flaws in setting the scheme's subsidy rate left it open to abuse as claimants could earn more cash the more fuel they burned, with the overspend estimated to be about £490m.
It has been centre stage in politics in Northern Ireland over the past month, with the resignation of Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister bringing the issue to a head.
Sinn Féin's refusal to re-nominate a deputy first minister on Monday left Secretary of State James Brokenshire with no option but to call fresh Assembly elections on 2 March.
Former first minister Arlene Foster set up the scheme in 2012 when she was enterprise minister.

article Mr Iwata underwent surgery last year and had resumed his duties after a brief period of recovery.
A highly revered figure in the Japanese gaming scene, he was considered the leading figure behind some of Nintendo's most popular devices since he joined the company in 2000.
Most recently, he led Nintendo into the rapidly growing mobile gaming sector.
Growing up in Japan in the 1980s, Super Mario was a gaming character that you couldn't avoid. But as the gaming population started to decline in the late 90s, Mr Iwata knew that he needed to make products that were more appealing to non-gamers.
And he succeeded. Nintendo DS quickly became the world's best-selling handheld game console when it was released in 2004.
Two years later, there came another successful launch of Wii which was dubbed the computer game that even your grandma can play. Together, they switched on millions of new converts to computer games.
But the rise of mobile phone games has posed a serious threat to Nintendo and some investors questioned his decision not to enter the market sooner.
As he put it himself, Mr Iwata was a chief executive who had the brain of a games developer and the heart of a gamer.
Nintendo's beloved gamer CEO
The iconic game maker has been losing market share to top competitors like Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's XBox, with its latest Wii U console third in line.
Nintendo made its first annual operating profit in four years to the year that ended in March.
Mr Iwata started out as a programmer in a Nintendo subsidiary in the 1980s and became president of Nintendo in 2002.
Under his leadership, the company launched its hugely successful Wii and Nintendo DS consoles and he was considered the crucial driver behind the focus on easy-to-use consoles, a move that allowed the company to tap into a much wider audience beyond the traditional gaming community.
"Mr Iwata was a titan - he certainly will be missed," Marc Einstein, head of digital media at Frost & Sullivan in Tokyo, told the BBC.
"He was very much known for being a gamer first and a [chief executive] second - a game changing figure."
Tributes have been coming in on social media with the team at PlayStation tweeting: "Thank you for everything, Mr. Iwata."

The Welsh Government said it saw "no merit" in appointing a Leave supporter to advise it in negotiations.
On Tuesday, AMs will debate the impact on Wales of the UK leaving the EU.
Prime Minister David Cameron said all the devolved governments would be involved in Brexit negotiations.
Conservative MP David Jones called for the first minister to appoint a Leave supporter to advise him on Wales' exit from the EU.
Mr Davies said, despite the expectations of many, "Wales has proven itself to be a Eurosceptic nation".
"As negotiations in relation to the UK's withdrawal from the EU continue, the Welsh Government must ensure public opinion is better reflected as part of this process."
He said the country needed "strong leadership that reflects the wishes of its people, and ensures the best deal for our country in this new era.
"That should include a role for those politicians of all parties who campaigned for a vote to leave."
In response to Mr Jones's suggestion, a Welsh Government spokesman said: "We don't see any merit in this idea.
"The Welsh Government will work through the consequences of the vote in good faith in the interests of the people of Wales."
Meanwhile Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood told BBC Wales she wanted to hold a special conference of Plaid Cymru members to decide where the party would go next and where Wales should go.
She has already proposed a new union of independent nations for the UK.
She said: "We want to keep the option open of remaining part of the European Union. We see our future as using pound sterling; we see the potential for pooling other functions, and that remains to be seen what they are.

article The Business Wales Accelerated Growth programme aims to help small and medium sized companies with export potential.
The six-year plan aims to support 1,000 firms, creating at least 10 new jobs at each and boosting exports by £200m.
Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the targets were achievable and would deliver sustainable business growth.
"This initiative within Business Wales is specifically designed to provide the highest level of business support to those companies that not only have the potential to grow rapidly but are run by people who are hungry for success," she said.
Hi-tech engineering, pharmaceutical, telecoms and food companies were among those backed by an earlier scheme called High Potential Starts.
"Ambitious", that is the one word that has come up often when I have been discussing this new fund with business people and economists.
On the face of it, creating 10,000 jobs from a fund of £20m seems to be remarkable.
Just yesterday another fund was launched for social enterprises, which has a target of creating 500 jobs from a £11m investment.
The key is the type of companies that are going to be selected for the new Accelerated Growth Fund.
If they are identified as firms with a high potential, perhaps in key sectors such as life sciences, then it is possible that there could be a significant increase in jobs delivered from an investment in them.
But if we look at a previous EU fund, Jeremie, that was £155m over a seven year period.
Initially it had a target of 15,000 new jobs. That was reduced to 10,000.
Though it is still in operation, with most of the money spent, it has created almost 3,500 jobs.
Extra funding for businesses will always be welcomed if it is targeted at getting more people into better paid work.
But it has to be part of a wider economic strategy and it has to deliver on its promises.
summary Wales has launched a new programme to help small businesses grow.

article The "clarification" came after its oil discovery in Horse Hill last week.
UKOG's chief executive told the BBC at the time that the Weald area, including the new discovery, could have "between 50 and 100 billion barrels of oil in place in the ground".
But the company now says it has "not undertaken work... sufficient to comment" on the Weald Basin potential.
A spokesman told the BBC that the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) - on which the company is listed - wanted UKOG to "clarify and reinforce the numbers".
UKOG announced: "The company has not undertaken work outside of its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible OIP [oil in place] in either the approximate 1,100 sq miles or the whole of the Weald Basin."
It added that "further well testing and assessment of recovery factors will be required to seek to quantify net resources in relation to the... areas and to prove its commerciality".
When the Horse Hill oil discovery was announced, the oil exploration company's chief executive Stephen Sanderson said: "We believe we can recover between 5% and 15% of the oil in the ground, which by 2030 could mean that we produce 10% to 30% of the UK's oil demand from within the Weald area."
UKOG maintains its estimation of the new Horse Hill discovery at 158 million barrels of oil per sq mile.
The company's share price has been volatile, after it soared on the announcement of the new discovery last week.

article All 42 Scottish Professional Football League clubs will vote on 23 April on a motion from Hibs, their Edinburgh rivals, Hearts and Motherwell.
The three clubs want to halve the amount of Premiership play-off gate receipts going to the league.
League bosses have recommended that the clubs vote against the proposal.
Motherwell, who are second bottom in the top flight, and Hibs, who sit second in the Championship, could both be involved in a series of play-offs for a place in the Premiership next season.
But Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster said: "No club will receive less from the play-off levy this season than they did last season.
"This is possible because the board of the SPFL has negotiated a live TV broadcasting deal for the Premiership play-off matches - all six games could be broadcast - at a match fee which is just 10% of what clubs receive from televised Scottish Cup ties.
"The TV deal has been approved by the Premiership clubs, but only one Premiership club will feature and the Championship clubs whose home gates could be affected by live TV were not consulted and didn't have a vote.
"All clubs benefitted from the levy last season and will continue to benefit this season."
The rules governing the play-offs were agreed by clubs - including Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell - two years ago, when the Scottish Premier League and the Scottish Football League merged to form the SPFL.
Current rules state that 50% of the cash generated through gate receipts goes to the SPFL, with every club not involved in the games getting a share.
It was designed to reduce the financial impact on the 42 clubs by paying parachute payments for a possible two clubs being relegated from the Premiership.
Hibs' proposal would reduce that to 25% and the difference in cash distributed could be as much as £500,000.
Dempster said: "The debate began in October when the board of the SPFL sought to introduce minimum pricing for play-off matches and to change the rules to state that season tickets were not valid.
"We disagree, because we believe clubs should be allowed the flexibility to deal with their season ticket holders as they think best."
Dempster pointed out that the Scottish FA was presently funding the parachute payment and said: "In those circumstances, all the levy does is take money paid by supporters to watch the team they support and redistribute that to every other team in the league.
"Any club which can imagine itself in that situation would say that was unfair."
The SPFL says that, as result of opposition from clubs, it will withdraw its proposal to prohibit admission via season tickets and impose minimum prices.
However, its board recommends rejecting Hibs' proposal, arguing that it is wrong to make a change that benefits only a few clubs at such a late stage in the season.
Meanwhile, Hibs say that Premiership clubs benefit most from the levy, with the champions earning 50 times as much as the winners of League Two.

article Matisyahu, a reggae singer, had been due to appear at the Rototom Sunsplash near Valencia on 22 August.
But he says he was asked by organisers to state his "positions on Zionism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict".
In a post on his Facebook page, Matisyahu said the pressure to air his views was "appalling and offensive".
A campaign to cancel Matisyahu's appearance was launched by the Valencia branch of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign.
The pro-Palestinian group calls for a boycott of Israeli goods until it complies with international law - Israel calls the campaign misleading and anti-Semitic.
BDS Valencia said that, because of some of Matisyahu's previous comments he had made on Israeli affairs, his values did not tally with those of the festival, namely "peace, equality, human rights and social justice".
The festival's organisers said Matisyahu's appearance was cancelled after they had "repeatedly sought dialogue in the face of the artist's unavailability to give a clear statement against war and on the right of the Palestinian people".
"The festival kept insisting that I clarify my personal views; which felt like clear pressure to agree with the BDS political agenda," Matisyahu - whose real name is Matthew Miller - wrote on his Facebook page.
"Honestly it was appalling and offensive, that as the one publicly Jewish-American artist scheduled for the festival they were trying to coerce me into political statements."
The singer, born in Pennsylvania, said he did not insert politics into his music, and that he wanted it to be accessible to all.
Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, criticised the decision and urged Spanish authorities "to take appropriate action against those responsible for it".
The Spanish Federation of Jewish Communities said the move was "cowardly, unfair and discriminatory".
The festival's organisers have since tried to dampen the controversy, saying in a statement: "We did not say no to Matisyahu because he has Hebrew roots or as a Zionist, but we just simply considered inappropriate organising something that would certainly generate a conflict."

article The directive came after reports that Kashmiri students were verbally abused and beaten in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan.
Kashmir saw fresh clashes between troops and protesters amid attempts to hold a by-election earlier in April.
Mr Singh said that Kashmiris were part of India's "family".
Muslim-majority Kashmir is at the centre of a decades-old territorial dispute between India and Pakistan.
Both countries claim Kashmir in its entirety and control different parts of it. India accuses Pakistan of supporting separatist sentiment in Kashmir, but Islamabad denies this.
In a tweet, Mr Singh said: "The Kashmiri youth also contribute in the progress of India. Action should be taken by the states against those who target them".
His comments came a day after six Kashmiri men studying at a university in Rajasthan were allegedly called terrorists and beaten up by locals.
Billboards that refer to "stone-pelting Kashmiris" and ask them to leave have also appeared in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
The latest bout of violence in Kashmir has killed nine people. Local protesters have been hurling stones at security forces who have been accused of opening fire into the crowds.
A viral video of a group of Kashmiris heckling a soldier has also contributed to anti-Kashmiri sentiment in the rest of the country.
There has been an armed revolt in the Muslim-majority region against rule by India since 1989.
High unemployment and complaints of heavy-handed tactics by security forces battling street protesters and fighting insurgents have aggravated the problem.

article Dean Cosker became the first Glamorgan bowler to 100 T20 wickets as Surrey never got going, with all the home sides bowlers taking wickets.
Wicket-keeper Chris Cooke claimed five victims, including the stumping of Dwayne Bravo for Cosker's hundredth.
Glamorgan's South African batsmen Colin Ingram and Jacques Rudolph put together a century stand to ensure the result.
Ingram led the way with another superlative innings, with 73 not out off just 49 balls.
There was another impressive performance of 2-20 in four overs from Glamorgan's South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn in his final appearance.
He claimed eleven wickets in his five matches, four of which were victories.
The Welsh county have five wins and one no-result in the first half of the T20 season, with Surrey still on four wins.
The visitors were left regretting the absence of Jason Roy, who struck a century in England's ten-wicket demolition of Sri Lanka in their one-day international at Edgbaston.
Glamorgan spinner Dean Cosker told BBC Wales Sport:
"Taking 100 wickets is something that I'll look back on probably when I finish playing, I'm just really enjoying the situation, we're playing really good cricket in this competition and long may it continue.
"Dwayne Bravo's a proven world-class player, so it was nice to get him out at a very important stage of the game as well, Chris Cooke's kept really well in the shorter form of the game.
"Is this Glamorgan's best T20 team? I'll tell you at the end of the competition, hopefully we can lift that trophy and then we will be the best ever.
"You'll have to ask (chief executive) Hugh Morris about that (playing on), I'm not sure how many times I can get peppered at backward point, my hands are falling off and my body's in bits, but that's all part of a 38 year-old diving around. I'll keep going as long as I can and I'm really enjoying it."

article Mohanad al-Akidi, the correspondent for the Sada news agency in the IS-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul, was shot dead at the Ghazlani base on Monday.
Mr Akidi was abducted in July while he travelled to Dohuk province.
On Friday Raad Mohamed al-Azzawi, a cameraman for Sama Salah Aldeen TV, was beheaded by IS militants in the city of Samarra. He had been held for a month.
Reporters Without Borders, which promotes and defends world media freedom, said it was "horrified by the jihadist group's constant crimes of violence".
"Islamic State is pursuing a policy of indiscriminate criminal violence that shows no pity towards journalists and does not hesitate to kidnap, torture and murder them," said its programme director, Lucie Morillon.
"Media personnel need the support and protection of the local authorities more than ever," she added.
The vast majority of foreign journalists have fled the large parts of Iraq and Syria controlled by IS because of the danger, leaving local reporters to document events.
IS has beheaded the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff in the past two months, and is holding the British journalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in a series of propaganda videos.
Earlier this month, IS issued guidelines for journalists operating in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zour.
They were told to swear allegiance as "subjects of the Islamic State", submit stories for approval, and inform the group of any social media accounts. Anyone violating the guidelines will be "held accountable".
Reporters Without Borders said Mr Azzawi had been threatened with death by IS in September because he refused to work for the group.

article Vancouver 2010 Olympian Jackson took the first podium of his career by guiding brakemen Stewart Benson, Bruce Tasker and Joel Fearon to a combined time of one minute 50.22 seconds.
It was 0.07 seconds off the gold medal.
The United States team, piloted by Vancouver 2010 Olympic champion Steve Holcomb, took victory in 1:50.15.
GB were in seventh position after the first run in New York, but finishing their second run in 55 seconds-dead was quicker than any of the other teams - and lifted them onto the podium.
This was GB Bobsleigh's first World Cup podium since Sean Olsson piloted them to bronze at the La Plagne World Cup in 1997.
And it marks an important milestone with the Sochi Winter Olympics beginning on 7 February in Russia.
GB hope to qualify two teams for the men's four and two-man competitions as well as the women's two-man event.
The British team's previous best finish of this campaign was eighth at the Park City World Cup in Utah.
Their achievement was all the more impressive given pilot Jackson, who ruptured his Achilles tendon in August, is yet to return to full fitness and cannot sprint at the beginning of the run to full intensity.
"I'm really proud of the guys," British Bobsleigh performance director Gary Anderson told BBC Sport.
"It is all about getting it right in Sochi. Our trajectory is looking good."
The German team, piloted by Thomas Florschuetz, finished third.

article A team from the Georgia Institute of Technology found fire ants can use their antennae as "extra limbs" to catch themselves when they fall, and can build stable tunnels in loose sand.
Researchers used high speed cameras to record in detail this behaviour.
The findings are published in the journal PNAS.
Dr Nick Gravish, who led the research, designed "scientific grade ant farms" - allowing the ants to dig through sand trapped between two plates of glass, so every tunnel and every movement could be viewed and filmed.
"These ants would move at very high speeds," he explained, "and if you slowed down the motion, (you could see) it wasn't graceful movement - they have many slips and falls."
Crucially, the insects were able to gather themselves almost imperceptibly quickly after each fall.
To see how they managed this, the team set up a second experiment where, to move from their nest to their food source, the ants had to pass through a labyrinth of smooth glass tunnels.
"We could watch these glass tunnels and really see what all the body parts were doing when the ants were climbing and slipping and falling," said Dr Gravish.
The researchers were surprised to see that the ants would not just use their legs to catch themselves, but also engaged their antennae, essentially using these sensory "sniffing" appendages as extra limbs to support their weight.
Finally, the researchers wanted to look inside the hidden labyrinths that the ants constructed underground, so they put ants into containers full of sand or soil and allowed them to dig.
They then built a "homemade X-Ray CT scanner", just like a medical scanner, to take 3D snapshots of the tunnels that the ants dug in different types of soil.
"We found that ant groups all dug tunnels of the same diameter, [no matter what the] soil conditions were," said Dr Gravish.
"This suggested to us that fire ants are actively controlling their excavation to create tunnels of a fixed size."
Keeping their tunnels at approximately one body length in diameter seemed to ensure that the ants could catch themselves when they slipped and allowed the creatures to continue to dig.
Prof Dan Goldman, who was also involved in the study, explained that these remarkably successful insects were able to manipulate their environment - using it to control their movement.
His overall aim, he explained, was to distil "the principles by which ants and other animals manipulate complex environments" and bring them to bear in the design of search-and-rescue robotics.
"The state of the art search-and-rescue robotics is actually quite limited," he told the BBC.
"Lots of the materials in disaster sites - landslides, rubble piles - are loose materials, which you're going to potentially have to create structures out of.
"You might want, for example, to create a temporary structure for people buried down beneath."
Fire ants, he explained, could build stable tunnels in sand or soil with almost no moisture to bind it together, so learning from them might enable designers to build and programme robots that solve these same engineering problems.
summary Fire ants can use their antennae to catch themselves when they fall, scientists have discovered.

article The BBC news website looks at the debate in Finland, where the difference between opinions is clearly defined, even within the government.
Last week, Finland's government said it was willing to double the number of refugees it was willing to accept this year, up to 30,000 from 15,000.
Only 3,600 applications were made last year - and so far this year, most applications were from Iraq and Somalia.
Some may even find themselves living with Prime Minister Juha Sipila, who said on Saturday that he was willing to give up one of his houses to migrants.
Mr Sipila has said he feels Finland, a country of 5.5m people, should set an example to the rest of Europe on migration.
But his coalition partners are the anti-immigration Finns Party, who came second in April's election.
Last month, Jussi Halla-aho, a Finns Party MEP, said some members of society were not integrating well enough, adding there was a risk "the society begins to play by the rules of the Muslim minority rather than expecting the minority to play by the rules of the society".
In July, Olli Immonen, one of the party's MPs, wrote of what he called "this nightmare called multiculturalism" on his Facebook page, adding: "We will fight until the end for our homeland and one true Finnish nation."
While the online responses to his comments were finely balanced between those who were for and against immigration, government colleagues were not supportive.
Finance Minister Alexander Stubb tweeted: "Multiculturalism is an asset. That's all I have to say." Mr Sipila wrote on Twitter that he wanted "to develop Finland as an open, linguistically and culturally international country".
Finns Party chief Timo Soini, who is Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, wrote on his blog last week that Christian and Yazidi minorities could be given priority as refugees.
But he came under heavy criticism and, in what Finnish newspapers noted was a significant swing, he changed course in an interview on Monday.
Concerns among right-wing politicians about the possible Islamisation of Finland, where 78% of the population belongs to the Lutheran Church, are reflected by sections of the public.
In August, before the new talks on migrant quotas, most Finns quoted in a survey said they would rather live next to an alcohol rehabilitation centre than a mosque, though no major polls have been conducted on people's opinions since then.
On 2 September, the head of the Finnish Lutheran Church, Archbishop Kari Makinen, urged members to take in refugees.
Soon after, 196 people resigned from the Church in one day, compared to 80 people on a typical day.
"As the Finnish Church wants to help house IS fighters in Finland, I do not accept it," one person wrote on a website through which members can resign.
"The Church no longer defends Christian values, â€‹â€‹they support Islam's entry into Finland. Shame on you fools," wrote another.
Among the most common concerns held by Finns, the state broadcaster says, is that:
These are concerns, it says, that are generally unfounded but widely shared.
Many anti-immigration bloggers concentrate on the financial burden of accepting more refugees. Finland's economy has slumped in recent years, having been in recession for three consecutive years.
In one protest against a new refugee centre last week, one demonstrator said: "Everything has been taken from the unemployed, the poor and the sick. But the coffers are empty.
"If these centres open, our taxes will go up."
On social media, there are many tales to be found, true or not, of attacks by immigrants. They are often widely shared, but we could not find confirmation of the attacks in Finnish media.
In one Facebook post written on 6 September, a man in western Finland detailed an alleged assault on two 12-year-old girls, purportedly by immigrants.
"These people are paperless asylum seekers whose backgrounds nobody in authority knows," the post said.
The post went on to be shared by more than 2,000 people and attracted many replies criticising immigrants.
Vitriolic comments are increasingly common. Last week, two large media groups closed comments on their websites because of what state broadcaster Yle called "a flood of hate speech and weak quality discussion".
"Particularly within the past year, the debate has become very sharp and aggressive, even including hate speech," Yle editorial director Atte Jaaskelainen said.
Marches in favour of multiculturalism have taken place in Finnish cities, with one - organised after Olli Immonen's comments in July - drew several thousand people in Helsinki.
In Finland's mainly neutral press, immigration is now rarely off the front pages. Articles concentrate largely on the plight of migrants and the work being done to help them.
Online, the voices speaking on behalf of immigration in Finland are more in evidence than those against.
On 12 September, a picnic to welcome migrants will be held in the capital, and has attracted more than 4,300 supporters on Facebook.
Meanwhile, another Facebook page named Ennenolin Pakolainen (I was a refugee before) has drawn more than 17,000 likes and compiles the stories of people who were refugees and what they are now doing in Finland - among them a trainee pilot, a nurse and a model.
Elsewhere, the Twitter account @TorillaOnTilaa brings together messages welcoming migrants - including many by Finnish national football team players.
"We are all equal," Fortuna Dusseldorf player Joel Pohjanpalo wrote.

article Ireland's O'Mahony, 27, will lead the Lions in the first Test against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday.
The flanker, who missed a year after the 2015 World Cup through injury, had to lead his Munster side following the death of head coach Anthony Foley.
"It was a really hard year but he'll have learned a lot," O'Connell said.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, the former Ireland and Munster lock added: "For some the Lions tour is the be-all and end-all but his experiences over the past few years have let him realise that nothing is.
"He's had a lot of experience with ups and downs."
O'Mahony was a fringe player for Ireland in this year's Six Nations after losing his place following a long-term knee injury.
His solitary start came when he was recalled for their final match against England, but only after Jamie Heaslip pulled out through injury minutes before kick-off.
O'Mahony was handed the start, picking up player of the match and earning himself a spot on the plane to New Zealand.
But the back rower's domestic season with Munster finished in disappointing fashion as his side were beaten by Saracens in the Champions Cup semi-final before losing out to Scarlets in the Pro12 Grand Final.
O'Connell says these experiences have helped O'Mahony and he will be ready to lead by example on Saturday.
"He's a Martin Johnson-type player," said his former Ireland and Munster team-mate. "He doesn't say a lot but when he speaks it carries weight, it won't be too complicated.
"He was probably a bit lucky that Sam Warburton is struggling with injury but the big thing you have to do as a skipper is play well yourself and lead by example. That's what he'll do."

article Ms Patel said the government's "biased" immigration policy prevented talented chefs from outside the EU from being able to come to the UK to work.
But Labour MP Keith Vaz, who backs Remain, accused Ms Patel of using EU migration as a "scapegoat".
It was "divide and rule politics of the worst kind", he said.
The UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.
Immigration is one of the key battlegrounds in the campaign, which has less than six weeks to go.
In an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper, Ms Patel claimed that the UK's curry restaurants were being denied high-quality chefs because of the caps on the number of non-EU workers able to come to the UK.
"This means that we cannot bring in the talents and the skills we need to support our economy.
"By voting to leave we can take back control of our immigration policies, save our curry houses and join the rest of the world," she said.
Conservative MP and EU exit campaigner Paul Scully, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for the British Curry Catering Industry, has made the same point.
In a Commons debate in October 2015, Mr Scully said if the UK left the EU "things such as the curry industry - bringing curry chefs over - might benefit".
Responding to Ms Patel's comments, Mr Vaz, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: "The problems facing Britain's curry houses could easily be solved by lowering the salary requirement for chefs recruited from abroad.
"But Priti Patel has failed to address this issue and is now conveniently using EU migration as a scapegoat. This is divide and rule politics of the worst kind."
He added: "The Leave campaign are determined to play people off against each other, but the hugely damaging impact of leaving the single market would be felt by us all no matter our background.
"We should have no truck with those who try to divide our society and wreck our economy."

article Five Catholics, including a 15-year-old boy, were killed in the attack on the Ormeau Road in 1992.
It was carried out by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). No-one has been convicted in relation to the killings.
Families said that the Police Ombudsman is due to publish a report into the murders at Easter.
Tommy Duffin, whose father Jack was one of those killed, said the report is the "only way we have to go" in terms of justice.
"We'll have to take into account what it says and where it leaves us as families, and then decide where we move from there.
"We're waiting with baited breath to a certain extent, to know exactly what it's going to say and what it's going to reveal to us."
The families have previously said they believe there was collusion between the killers and security forces.
In 2015, the PSNI's chief constable apologised after it was discovered that the weapon used in the killings was on display in the Imperial War Museum in London.

article But while we wait for that to resolve itself - the former prime minister's daughter Carol is reported to be in talks with museum bosses - we decided to take a look at some of her most memorable fashion moments.
Lady Thatcher (then Margaret Roberts) working as a research chemist in 1950. She is reputed to have helped invent Mr Whippy ice cream, although there is some debate about that.
This is a royal blue velvet dress, a colour she favoured throughout her time as prime minister, and a halo style hat trimmed with ostrich feathers on her wedding day in 1951.
Thatcher attends a Cabinet meeting in 1972 with a ministerial red box in one hand and one of her soon-to-be famous handbags in the other.
Thatcher wears a pale blue waistcoat, and one of those pussybow shirts, for which she would become renowned in 1979 before she became prime minister.
Outside the Oval Office in the summer of 1987 with US President Ronald Reagan, Thatcher shows off a stylish two piece.
Looking defiant in a cream headscarf and jacket during her visit to British forces in Fallingbostel, Germany in 1986.
During her trip to Moscow in 1987, Thatcher greeted crowds in an elegant, fur-trimmed winter coat. She was first dubbed the Iron Lady by Soviet Army newspaper Red Star.
Ten years after entering Downing Street, Thatcher thanks the applauding crowd at the Blackpool 1989 Conservative conference dressed in brilliant blue.
At the start of her third term, the "helmet" of swept back hair is (very) firmly in place, along with the pearls, a hangover from her pre-Downing Street days.

Keates revealed Pearson turned down a number of offers, including a Football League club, to sign for Wrexham.
"He's a leader and everything that I want at the football club," Keates said.
"He's the perfect match for this football club and how we want to go forward. He gives 110 percent in everything that he does and a great character on and off the field.
"He'll do a great job for this football club and all being well he can play his part in us going forward."
Pearson is Wrexham's second signing of the close season following the arrival of versatile full-back James Hurst.
Keates, who previously said he wanted to sign 14 players this summer, is hoping to confirm further additions this week
"It's all been agreed but I wouldn't say they are Wrexham players until the i's have been dotted and the t's have been crossed," Keates added.
"All being well we'll have one or two more added to the squad going forward."

article Most housing associations and councils have issued statements to say their accommodation complies with regulations and is safe.
Some fire brigades have described their high-rise training facilities.
The authorities have also expressed sorrow over the deaths at Grenfell Tower in north Kensington.
Many, including Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, pointed out that serious fires are extremely rare.
The law requires the owners or managers of high-rise buildings to make sure appropriate fire precautions are in place to safeguard people living or working there.
This may include the fitting of sprinklers, rising mains, ventilation and fire alarm systems.
Kent Fire and Rescue Service and London Fire Brigade were two of those which also published safety advice for people living in tower blocks.
A number of local authority landlords highlighted recent improvements and extra safety measures.
Sandwell Council said all of its blocks have automatic smoke ventilation systems, bin room sprinkler systems, bin chute cut-off slides and dry risers - pipes used by the fire service to distribute water to multiple levels of a building.
Oxford City Council said it was carrying out renovations that "have delivered substantial improvements" to fire safety.
Fortis Living, which looks after Worcestershire's buildings, said upgrade work has been done, which includes firebreaks on every floor. Magenta Living, which does the same in Birkenhead, Merseyside, said its high-rise blocks "undergo an annual, independently carried out, fire safety risk assessment".
Nottingham's housing association said it was "confident the systems are robust".
Brighton and Hove City Council said it will review fire safety in council-owned housing stock, and there are already plans for two further sprinkler systems to be installed.
Salix Homes in Salford said all its high-rise blocks comply with regulations, but "following the tragic incident in London, we will now be working with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service and Greater Manchester Housing Providers to look at any lessons that can be learnt" and Hull City Council said similar.
Both Cheshire and West Midlands Fire and Rescue Services emphasised their training programmes.
The West Midlands service has a special facility in Oldbury where floors can be configured in a range of different ways, there are internal and external staircases and a lift shaft. Instructors use it to set fires in condition where they can vary ventilation, wind speed and the internal movement of smoke and fire gases.

article He made the promise in a phone call with incoming French President Emmanuel Macron, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump is still deciding whether to withdraw from the accord - an election campaign promise.
Climate experts worry such a move would throw the agreement into chaos.
A White House meeting to discuss the topic on Tuesday has been postponed, amid reports of divisions among senior Trump advisers.
It is the second time the meeting has been cancelled. No new date has been given.
The current disagreement within the White House over whether the US should withdraw from the Paris climate agreement is a prime example of the much-reported palace intrigue within the Trump administration spilling out into a policy debate.
In one corner you have senior officials like strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who are on record calling for an exit from the accord. Others, like Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have been noncommittal. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the US should keep a "seat at the table" and presidential adviser/daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner are pro-Paris.
Donald Trump, while he did once tweet that global warming was a Chinese conspiracy, has largely avoided extended discussions on the subject. While his administration is steadily driving to roll back many Obama-era regulations, environmental issues as a whole seem of little interest to him.
Any White House meeting to hash out a coherent policy on the Paris agreement is destined to be contentious and with a decidedly uncertain resolution. A battle no-one is convinced they will win is one that is ripe for delay - again.
Mr Xi told Mr Macron China and France "should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement", according to the Chinese foreign ministry.
Under former President Barack Obama, the US and China issued several joint statements on climate change, even announcing together they would sign the Paris agreement. The two countries are the world's biggest polluters.
For his part, when Mr Macron received his congratulatory phone call from the US president he told him he would also seek to defend the climate deal.
Speaking on Tuesday at a conference in Milan, Italy, Mr Obama said the US and China had to "lead the way" in the fight against climate change.
"The good news is the private sector has already made a determination that the future is clean energy," he said.
"Those things are locked in now, into the energy sector. Because of the debates taking place in the current administration the steps may be taken more slowly than they would have been done, but I'm confident," he added.
The latest comments come as climate negotiators meet in the German city of Bonn to discuss how to put the Paris agreement into practice.
Almost 200 countries have backed the agreement, which aims to keep global temperature increases "well below" 2C.
It also seeks to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels in an effort to limit floods, droughts and rising sea levels.
President Trump has previously said he believes there is no evidence that humans are responsible for climate change.
He has called for more drilling, fewer regulations and the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada.

article Negotiations are continuing between the former Celtic boss and the Scottish Championship club with a view to him succeeding Alan Stubbs.
Stubbs left for Rotherham United last week after two seasons in charge and having just won the Scottish Cup.
Lennon is believed to want Garry Parker as his number two at Hibs, who missed out promotion to the Premiership after a play-off defeat by Falkirk.
The pair played together at Leicester City and Lennon had Parker as part of his coaching team at Celtic and Bolton Wanderers.
Former Northern Ireland midfielder Lennon, who won the League Cup twice as a player with Leicester, served Celtic as a player for six-and-a-half years, winning five Scottish titles and six domestic cups.
After a spell back in English football, Lennon rejoined Celtic as a coach in 2008 and eventually became manager in 2010.
He enjoyed further success in the dugout at Celtic Park with three successive top-flight titles and two Scottish Cup triumphs before leaving in 2014.
A move to Bolton followed later that year and, although Wanderers initially improved under Lennon, they were bottom of the Championship by the time he left in March, with the side eventually relegated.
Hibs have spent the last two seasons in Scotland's second tier, having also lost out in the promotion play-offs in 2015.
However, having ended their 114-year wait to win the Scottish Cup, the Edinburgh club will enter the Europa League qualifying rounds, with their first match on 14 July.
On Sunday, Stubbs told BBC Scotland he thought that Lennon, his former Celtic team-mate, would be a "a good choice" for the Easter Road vacancy.

article Liberty Global, which also has a 10% stake in UK TV company ITV, has not formally announced its offer and has until 19 November to decide if it will.
The deal would allow Liberty Global to expand its reach in the Caribbean where it lacks a mobile phone presence.
Cable & Wireless said the deal could be a combination of cash and shares.
Liberty Global, which is owned by billionaire John Malone, has a strong foothold in Latin America and growing presence in the Caribbean.
Last month Liberty abandoned talks with Vodafone about a swap of business assets in Europe's mobile phone, broadband and TV markets.
In November 2014, Cable & Wireless paid $1.85bn (Â£1.2bn) for Columbus International, a fibre-based telecommunications firm that Mr Malone owned a stake in.
The deal gave the Liberty Global owner a 13% voting stake in Cable & Wireless.

article The Solar Impulse craft is a day into what was expected to be a 130-hour journey from China to Hawaii.
However, meteorologists say the forecast is worsening.
They have asked the pilot to stay in a holding pattern while they decide whether he should continue or turn back towards land.
They will reassess the situation at a team briefing at 08:00 GMT Monday.
This is the seventh leg in an attempt to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun.
The experimental craft, which is covered in 17,000 solar cells, took off from Abu Dhabi in March.
The Pacific crossing, however, was always going to be the most challenging part of this epic journey.
The team has already had to wait for a month in Nanjing for the right weather conditions to take off.
The plane not only needs favourable winds to push forwards, it also needs cloud-free skies during the day to soak up enough energy from the sun to enable it to fly during the night.
The team's meteorologists thought they had identified a suitable weather window - and the plane set off at 18:39 GMT on Saturday.
Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg, who is flying solo, had been making good progress, however a weather front could now pose problems.
Solar Impulse's Bertrand Piccard, who has been monitoring the flight from mission control in Monaco, said:  "Yesterday we had the possibility to cross the weather front just before Hawaii on day five.
"However, with the forecasts we now have, we don't see this possibility anymore, which means that for the moment the road to Hawaii is blocked.
"We need all the data from the next weather forecasts, so that our weather experts can analyse what's going to happen in the next four to five days."
The plane is currently in a holding pattern over the Sea of Japan.
For now, this is the safest thing to do - if the craft flies past a certain point, were anything to go wrong, the pilot would have to bail out into the ocean.
'We have asked Andre to stay where he is: it's fine, the weather is good and the batteries are charging," added Mr Piccard.
The team will now have to decide whether to press on with the flight, or abort the attempt and head back to land to await clearer skies.
The fear is that further delays could have an impact on the later stages of the flight.
Ideally, the team needs to cross the United States, and then the Atlantic, before the hurricane season starts to peak in August.

article The UK prime minister told the BBC there was a "stalemate" on the ground, but work must continue internationally to try to find a solution.
UK military chiefs have warned of the risks of arming rebel groups.
Mr Cameron said there was "too much extremism" among the opposition, but moderate groups still deserved support.
Syrian government forces have taken the initiative in recent months, and have been bolstered by the capture of the strategically important town of Qusair in the west of the country in June.
Most of the much bigger city of Homs has been recaptured by government troops backed by Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Washington and London have been looking at ways to increase logistical support for opposition groups and the UK announced last week it was sending Â£650,000-worth of protective clothing to guard them against chemical and biological attacks.
By Emily BuchananBBC world affairs correspondent
Today's interview shows just how far David Cameron has rowed back from his previous bullish calls for action.
Last November he called on the newly re-elected Barack Obama to address the Syrian crisis as a priority. Then, in December, he pushed the EU for an early review of the arms embargo.
But as the conflict has dragged on and more evidence of the involvement of extremist groups has emerged, discomfort over getting involved in a bitter civil war has grown.
It's unlikely that arming the rebels could now be passed through Parliament with dozens of Conservative MPs opposed.
Although the prime minister still wants to help moderate forces, how that can be achieved is far from clear. He called the conflict a stalemate.
With Russia still supporting President Assad, so too it seems is Western policy on Syria.
But reports have suggested support for supplying weapons to rebel groups is receding, due to strong political opposition and widespread concerns about arms falling into the wrong hands.
Mr Cameron told the Andrew Marr show that President Bashar al-Assad was an "evil" man who was doing "terrible things to his people".
But he also said the UK "should have nothing to do" with elements of the opposition also reported to have committed atrocities.
"It is a very depressing picture and it is a picture which is on the wrong trajectory," he said of the conflict.
"There is too much extremism among the rebels. There is also still appalling behaviour from this dreadful regime using chemical weapons. There is an enormous overspill of problems into neighbouring countries."
He added: "I think he [Assad] may be stronger than he was a few months ago but I'd still describe the situation as a stalemate."
Despite the UK's concerns about the actions and views of some opposition groups, Mr Cameron said the UK had a duty to support those pushing for a "democratic, free and pluralistic" country.
"You do have problems with part of the opposition which is extreme, that we should have nothing to do with. But that is not a reason for pulling up the drawbridge, putting our head in the sand and doing nothing.
"What we should be doing is working with international partners to help the millions of Syrians who want to have a free democratic Syria, who want to see that country have some form of success."
Mr Cameron also said reports in the media that his wife had been a strong influence on his policy were a "total urban myth".
Samantha Cameron visited a refugee camp in Lebanon in March in her role as ambassador for Save The Children, in which she met families and children displaced by the conflict.
It has been suggested that she has since pressed for a stronger humanitarian response.
The UN says the refugee crisis is the worst for 20 years, with 1.7 million forced to seek shelter in neighbouring countries and an average of 6,000 people fleeing every day this year.
Mr Cameron said his wife had been "very moved" by what she had seen and heard from people who had lost loved ones and whose communities had been destroyed.
But he added: "She does not influence my policy on this. I have been very passionate about this for a long time."

article Think Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam; Richard Nixon and the opening to China; George Bushes Senior and Junior and their Iraq wars.
This election offers voters a real choice. Despite Donald Trump's sometimes incoherent and seemingly improvisational approach to foreign policy, the two candidates do offer quite different visions. Hillary Clinton firmly believes the US role is to uphold a global security order from which it also benefits, the Pax Americana at the core of traditional US military and diplomatic thinking.
Donald Trump's America First approach is more transactional. He frames alliances in business terms, vowing to get better value from them or pull back from historic commitments he says the US can no longer afford.
This is how their differences might play out in key international issues.
In no other area has Donald Trump departed more radically from decades of US foreign policy than his approach to traditional relationships. He has castigated Nato as outdated and obsolete and characterised its members as ungrateful allies who benefit from US largesse.
He says America can no longer afford to protect countries in Europe - and in Asia - without adequate compensation, suggesting he would withdraw American forces unless they pay up.
He's also said Nato members like the Baltic states couldn't count on the US to come to their military aid if attacked by Russia, unless they'd fulfilled their obligations.
Mr Trump is voicing longstanding criticisms. President Obama has also expressed frustration that most Nato members don't meet their goal of spending at least 2% of GDP on defence.
But Mr Obama stands firmly by the military alliance. As does Mrs Clinton, who proclaims Nato one of the best investments America has ever made.
She's said Mr Trump has made himself unfit for office by stepping away from Nato's "ironclad" mutual defence commitments, and some in his own party have warned his approach could embolden Russia.
As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the architect of the "reset" aimed at greater co-operation with Russia, but she left office urging a harder line against President Vladimir Putin. That distrust carries over into her policy proposals to "stand up to Putin" and increase the costs of his actions.
While she acknowledges the US needs to work with Moscow where it can, she vows to partner with allies to limit its "aggression" in places like Ukraine and Syria.
She advocates strengthening Nato and improving the energy security of European states, and is willing to consider new sanctions.
In a reversal of traditional party roles, it's the Republican Trump who has taken a more conciliatory tone to Moscow. But he's gone further than any other presidential candidate ever, amidst charges that Russia is trying to disrupt the election by hacking Democratic Party emails.
That's prompted allegations that his campaign has ties to the Kremlin. The real estate mogul has a history of business dealings with Russia and a number of advisers with Russian connections. The FBI, however, hasn't found any direct links.
Mr Trump says said he believes he can ease tensions with Mr Putin, and has praised him as a strong leader with whom he would love to have a good relationship.
He's said little about what this might involve beyond a desire for a joint fight against the Islamic State militants. But he intends to find out if the Russians would be "reasonable", confident that he could better command Mr Putin's respect than Mrs Clinton or President Obama.
Both candidates see so-called Islamic State as a global threat that must be defeated.
Hillary Clinton mostly adopts what President Obama is doing. Donald Trump talks tougher, vowing to "bomb the shit"out of IS and "take back the oil" from the group.
He's also criticised the current administration for failing to use the element of surprise in attacks, especially in the campaign against the IS-held city of Mosul.
The rhetoric is different, but many of the candidates' policy proposals sound similar.
Both talk about fighting IS with a coalition of Western and Arab states in ways the US is already doing, although they would intensify the campaign. Neither would send American combat troops to fight the group in Iraq and Syria. Donald Trump flirted with the idea at one point but seems to have dropped it.
However, he is much more willing to work with Russia in the fight against IS than Mrs Clinton, and supports harsh interrogation techniques of captured fighters, which she does not.
The candidates might also differ on what happens the day after in Mosul is captured. Mrs Clinton seems more likely to invest in fixing sectarian politics that could lead to new conflict.
Broadly speaking, Hillary Clinton is open to involvement in the civil war and Donald Trump is not.
He does support a safe zone to stop the flood of refugees but says wealthy Arab countries should set it up.
In line with US policy, defeating so-called Islamic State is a higher priority for Mr Trump than persuading Bashar al-Assad to step down.
But he argues that the Syrian president is fighting IS, which Mrs Clinton disputes. He's also suggested he wouldn't back the rebels and that overthrowing Mr Assad could lead to something worse.
President Obama has similar misgivings, but covertly he does supply some rebels with some weapons and overtly he takes their side in peace talks. He also believes the Assad regime is the most destructive force in Syria and has to be replaced in order to change the environment that breeds Islamist violence. He has tried to achieve that through diplomacy but Mrs Clinton is prepared to go further.
She supports a No Fly Zone - a move that could lead to confronting Syrian and Russian warplanes. The idea would be to protect civilians and control some Syrian territory to use as leverage in a future settlement.
She might also be open to supplying heavier weapons to rebel groups. But the bottom line is that Moscow's military involvement in Syria has severely limited options. No one wants to go to war with Russia.
The Iran nuclear deal has reduced the immediate threat of a military confrontation with the US, but the new president may struggle to see it implemented.
Hillary Clinton supports the agreement. Indeed, she laid much of the groundwork for it while she was secretary of state. But she takes a tougher tone than President Obama.
She calls her approach "distrust and verify", promising to penalise Iran for any violations. She's also laid out a broader strategy to confront its "bad behaviour" in the region.
This includes maintaining Israel's military superiority, bolstering security cooperation with Arab allies in the Gulf, and building a coalition to counter Iran's proxies. And she's signalled that she'd take a more forthright stand against human rights violations than the Obama administration.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hates the agreement and opposes all aspects of it - he's called it 'one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history,' and maintains that Iran got the better of Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton.
He contends he could renegotiate it, although hasn't convincingly spelled out how he'd be able to do that. His pledge to counter Iran's push to "destabilise and dominate" the region doesn't sound so different from Mrs Clinton's, although it lacks the detail.
Both are prepared to use force if Iran tries to obtain a nuclear weapon.
There has been debate within the Democratic party about America's unconditional support for Israel, but that is not reflected in Hillary Clinton's platform.
She promises to guarantee Israel's qualitative military edge in the region, oppose the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, and cut off all efforts to unilaterally recognise Palestinian statehood or achieve it outside of direct negotiations with Israel.
Donald Trump initially pledged to be neutral in any peace talks. But he's since doubled down on promising an unbreakable alliance with Israel and taken a harder line on the Palestinians. He's said he supports a two-state solution but it would only be possible when the Palestinians overcome their "ingrained hatred" of Israel and stop "teaching their children to be terrorists".
His advisers, though, have questioned the viability of a two-state solution, a cornerstone of US policy, and any reference has been dropped from the Republican platform. That's distressed American Jewish lobbyists, who see it as essential to Israel's future as a democratic and Jewish state.
At the same time, Israel's Jerusalem Post newspaper has noted that Mrs Clinton showed limited interest in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as secretary of state. It's suggested Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would most likely welcome such a position after the Obama administration's failed attempts to broker a peace deal.
The new president will inherit a crucial but complex relationship with this rising global power, characterised by disputes over its economic policy, charges of cyber theft, and claims to territory in the Asian seas.
Donald Trump approaches China primarily as a trade issue, singling Beijing out for criticism on dumping exports and devaluing its currency. He has said he would "use trade to negotiate", threatening tariffs as high as 45% and promising to designate Beijing as a currency manipulator.
Hillary Clinton has also vowed to impose consequences for trade abuses but says the relationship doesn't fit neatly into categories like friend or rival. She was a central actor in President Obama's strategic pivot to Asia and would continue to reinforce US alliances with Asian states as a counterweight to China.
She calls for increasing co-operation with Beijing in areas of mutual interest, but would press it to play by international rules.
She'd take a stronger stand on China's human rights record. She'd also continue to challenge its programme of "island building" in disputed waters and might be more hawkish about conducting intrusive air and sea patrols to ensure freedom of navigation.
Mr Trump has attributed China's assertive behaviour in regional waters to American weakness, but he has not spelled out how he would respond to it.
The next president will face a North Korea well on its way to becoming a nuclear power capable of delivering an atomic missile. Current US policy is a mix of sanctions and the promise of negotiations if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear programme.
That hasn't worked and isn't likely to, according to the head of US intelligence James Clapper.
He said recently that pressing the regime to give up its nuclear weapons was probably a "lost cause" because they were its "ticket to survival". The best the US could hope for, Clapper said, was a cap on North Korea's nuclear capabilities.
Nevertheless, Hillary Clinton would do more of the same: work with the UN to increase sanctions, bolster missile defences in Japan and South Korea, and press China to use its influence to deter Pyongyang.
Donald Trump suggests a more confrontational approach: he claims China has "total control" over North Korea and says he would "make trade very difficult" for Beijing if it didn't solve the problem.
He's prepared to talk directly with the isolated leader Kim Jong Un, a major shift in US policy. And he's said he'd be open to Japan developing its own nuclear deterrent, triggering fears of nuclear proliferation in East Asia.

article Filming of the Troubles-themed video took place on Thursday at Olympia Drive, with extras in period costume and 1970s-styled vehicles.
However, this meant that the road was cleared, and some locals complained of parking difficulties on nearby streets.
Some felt it brought back painful memories, although others said they had no problem with it.
The shoot recreated a bomb attack, and included burning cars, actors dressed as soldiers from the 1970s, and extras playing traumatised and bloodied victims running from the scene.
Footage was also shot on Wednesday in the New Lodge area of north Belfast, the same area where much of Rihanna's video for We Found Love was filmed.
The production company had informed Olympia Drive residents by letter that filming would take place between 09:00 and 21:00 GMT on Thursday.
One man said that cars displaced from the street into neighbouring streets had caused disruption.
"It was quite busy this morning, with cars from other streets parked outside my premises, which were blocking the way of care workers getting in to help a disabled elderly couple," he said.
However, he said he was not opposed to the video itself.
"I think it's actually a good thing because it's showing people in England, Scotland and Wales what it was like in Belfast," he said.
"I'm hoping those days don't come back because I've got young kids."
Another woman said she was annoyed because she could not use her normal parking space.
"I have been coming to this office every day for the last 35 years and I get a parking space every day," she said.
"I couldn't care if U2 were flying up in the sky - I object to this as a ratepayer."
However, some young extras said they were having a great time during the filming.
"We were doing a riot scene - it's a good experience," said one of them.

He was treated at the scene by the ambulance service but died a short time later.
An investigation is under way to establish the circumstances. Metrolink services to Manchester Airport were suspended for several hours.
In a tribute, Mr Hughes' brothers said: "Martin was a great lover of the outdoors and loved going for long walks in the countryside and hills around Greater Manchester and beyond, he was also a keen cyclist.
"We are all devastated that he has been taken from us so suddenly."
Peter Cushing, Transport for Greater Manchester's Metrolink director, said a "thorough operational investigation" has begun and the driver and staff were being supported.

article Larissa Waters, from the minor Greens party, was born in Canada.
Under Australia's constitution, a person cannot run for federal office if they hold dual or plural citizenship.
On Friday, another Greens senator, Scott Ludlam, also resigned for having dual citizenship. Both politicians were deputy leaders of the party.
In May, Ms Waters gained international attention by becoming the first politician to breastfeed in Australia's federal parliament.
Ms Waters said she only discovered her citizenship status following the case of Mr Ludlam, who had recently learned he was a New Zealand national.
Holding back tears at a press conference on Tuesday, Ms Waters described her error as an "honest mistake".
"I was devastated to learn that because of 70-year-old Canadian laws I had been a dual citizen from birth, and that Canadian law changed a week after I was born and required me to have actively renounced Canadian citizenship," she said.
The senator, 40, was 11 months old when she left Canada with her Australian parents.
"All of this happened before I could even say my first word," she said.
However, Ms Waters, who was first elected in 2011, said she took "full responsibility".
It is not yet clear whether she and Mr Ludlam will have to repay their Senate salaries and allowances.
"Certainly it is something that may occur and I will face it if it comes," Ms Waters said.
Greens leader Richard Di Natale said he was "gutted" by the resignation of Ms Waters, who had made an "enormous contribution" to Australia.
The party leader said he was taking immediate action to ensure the mistake would not be repeated.
"It has been a terrible month, there is no other way of sugar-coating it," he said.
According to Australia's constitution, politicians must relinquish foreign citizenships before standing for office.

article Heather Knight rounds off her first summer as England captain with a look back at the first Women's Super League - and a look ahead to another busy winter.
It was really good fun being part of the brand new competition and I think it has been a huge success. Unfortunately, our campaign ultimately ended with defeat in the final at the hands of the Southern Vipers…
Despite the result, it was great to be involved in the first finals day at Chelmsford and the first ever final, after coming away with a win in the semi-final against Loughborough Lightning. Although no one likes coming second, the Vipers were the better team on the day and congrats to Lottie (Charlotte Edwards) and her team.
We played some brilliant cricket all tournament and we can be proud of the competition we had as a squad, including a very well deserved player of the tournament award being presented to my Storm team-mate Stafanie Taylor, the West Indies captain.
It's been great to get to know and bring together a new group of players, including our overseas imports. I've definitely learnt that South Africa's Lizelle Lee is very gullible, with a perfect example when Kiwi Rachel Priest persuaded her she could definitely make this shot during a round of pitch and putt…
In terms of how the tournament has gone as a whole, I think it has been a massive success. People have come to watch, the cricket has been of a very high standard and it's created that level between international and county cricket that it set out to do.
Another massive positive for me has been to see some of the younger England Women's Academy and county players putting in some match-winning performances.
The younger girls in the Western Storm squad have definitely developed and learnt a lot over the course of the competition - something that I'm sure has happened in all the teams. That opportunity for them to train with and play against the best players really is priceless.
When I first played for England six years ago, I'd only played a handful of games with a white ball, I'd hardly played in front of more than 20 people and I didn't have a clue as to what to expect from international cricket - I had to learn pretty quickly.
Now the girls coming through have the opportunity to play in this type of competition below international cricket where people are watching them, their skills are under pressure and they're playing against the best players in the world - that can only be a good thing in developing England players of the future.
As a first year, it's a great place to start from, so big credit to Clare Connor (the England & Wales Cricket Board's director of England women's cricket), Jo Kirk (Super League general manager) and everyone at the ECB who has made it possible. Hopefully the competition will continue to develop and grow over the coming years with an increased radio and TV presence.
I wrote in my last column that I hoped to see some Stormtroopers out to watch our home games, and people of the West Country, you didn't disappoint! The crowds overall were brilliant and it was great to see people getting behind the new competition.
With the ICC Women's World Cup taking place in England next summer and a number of the leading international players in the country for the Super League, a few of us headed to Lord's for a marketing shoot and interviews to promote the tournament.
Alongside fellow Western Storm players Anya Shrubsole and Stafanie Taylor, we hot-footed it down to London on the train following our game at Headingley. I had to chuckle to myself as we all ran along the platform for our train with our massive cricket bags - I think it was a new experience for Stafanie as there aren't many trains in Jamaica!
She did, however, proudly declare that she had taken the London Underground before, to a place called Pretoria. Following our bemused looks, it took her two hours to realize she actually meant Victoria!
We made it safely to Lord's ready for a 6am start the next day alongside Dane van Niekerk (South Africa and Loughborough Lightning), Ellyse Perry (Australia and Loughborough Lightning) and Suzie Bates (New Zealand and Southern Vipers).  We were all then dressed in some very strange "Ghostbuster" outfits ready for the shoot. Uncanny…
It was a long, but fun day and definitely got the excitement going for a home World Cup next year.
So it's not long now until we head away again with England at the end of September to the West Indies, which is a massive tour for us, with ICC Women's Championship points up for grabs.
Beyond that, we have a tour to Sri Lanka and then I'll be heading out to Australia for the Women's Big Bash League to join up with the Hobart Hurricanes once again.
Roll on another winter chasing the sun.
BBC Test Match Special will have ball-by-ball commentary on England's one-day international series in West Indies, which runs from 8-19 October - and you can read more BBC columns from Heather during the winter.

article Both sides have overlapping claims in the sea, leading to severe tensions.
China has refused to take part in the arbitration and warned that the case will damage bilateral ties.
The latest move comes a day after a Philippine ship evaded Chinese vessels to bring supplies to troops stationed on a disputed shoal.
China claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea - creating multiple overlaps with areas claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan.
The Philippines says that China's claims are illegal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
In January, the Philippines asked the UN's Permanent Court of Arbitration to consider its case. It is thought that the court may not reach a decision before the end of 2015.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said that more than 40 maps and "nearly 4,000 pages" of evidence had been submitted to the tribunal.
"It is about defending what is legitimately ours... it is about guaranteeing freedom of navigation for all nations," he said, adding that it would help "preserve regional peace, security and stability".
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said last week that China would not accept the arbitration, and that the Philippines should "stop going any further down the wrong track so as to avoid further damage to bilateral relations".
China was "committed to managing and resolving relevant issues... through dialogue and consultation," he added.
On Saturday, a Philippine government ship slipped past Chinese coast guard vessels to reach the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ayungin in Manila and Ren'ai Reef in Beijing.
Philippine troops are stationed on a beached, rusting military ship that analysts say has become a symbol of the country marking its territory.
On 9 March, China prevented two Philippine vessels from reaching the shoal. Philippine officials said the ships carried supplies for the troops on the shoal, but China said the ships carried construction supplies.
Following the incident, Philippine planes air dropped supplies onto the shoal.
summary China and the US have agreed to a new international arbitration case over the South China Sea.

article Ysgol y Llys' film Gwlan (Wool) clinched best documentary category in Spanish international youth film festival Plasencia Encorto.
The Welsh-language project was scripted, edited and shot by four Year five pupils at the Prestatyn school.
Deputy head Rhys Griffith said they were "overjoyed" to have won.
Funded by a Â£5,000 grant, the film was made with the help of local filmmaker Michael Kitchin, who travelled to Spain to accept the award on their behalf.
"It was pretty exciting when we found out we were in the final - but when we found out we won we were overjoyed," Mr Griffith said.
He said the film's success lay in its subject matter.
"It was the treatment of it," he said. "It depicts local sheep shearers, wearing their traditional shoes, carrying out their jobs.
"And we also have the school choir singing in Welsh throughout in the background."
Mr Griffith said the project was initially launched to improve pupils' digital skills.
"We also have a lot of kids who are interested in acting and the creative arts so we thought we'd give it a go," he added.
"They worked really hard. It's given them skills - but it's also given them real confidence in themselves.
"There's been a real buzz about it. They were all really disappointed when the project finished."
The film has also been entered in competitions in London, Dublin, Australia and Slovakia - with judges in Australia praising its use of Welsh.
Since its success, the budding directors have gone on to make an anti-bullying film, now being used by Talacre-based education activity centre DangerPoint.
The group were even invited to judge a category at Prestatyn's Wales International Youth Film Festival Wicked:16 last year - and saw their film screened at the local independent Scala Cinema.
"It looked fantastic," said Mr Griffith.
And, he added, the project has now encouraged pupils to produce more films, with some eager to pursue creative careers.
"One of the group is really keen on acting, and has joined his local amateur dramatic group. And the others want to do more projects.
"It has lit a fire in their bellies."

article Ahmed Mohamed and his family were received at a presidential compound in Sudan's capital Khartoum on Wednesday, according to state-run radio.
The Texan teenager was pulled out of class and handcuffed because a teacher mistook his clock for a bomb.
His arrest was sharply criticised and the police declined to file charges.
The boy's father, Mohamed Hassan al-Sufi, is a Sudanese immigrant to the US and a former presidential candidate who ran against Mr Bashir.
The Sudan leader is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes in Darfur, which he denies.
Ahmed said he was pleased to meet the president and vowed to return one day with a new invention, according to the radio broadcast.
He has also been invited to the White House by US President Barack Obama, who tweeted his support after the incident.
Nasa scientists and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also praised the boy's initiative.
The police rejected a suggestion by Ahmed's family that he was detained because he was Muslim.
Just what is a 'suspicious' object?

article Lt-Col Christopher Davies, 45, was arrested following an alleged incident on 10 April this year, police in Ontario have said.
The officer, who was in Canada on a temporary posting, has been bailed to appear in court on 15 September.
An army spokesman said it was aware of an investigation involving a serving British army officer.
The alleged assault occurred at Fort Frontenac, in Kingston, following commemorations for the World War One Battle of Vimy Ridge, on 9 April, police said.
The alleged victim - a 52-year-old female officer - had attended a military function at the fort.
She then allegedly went to a bar with other guests, including Lt-Col Davies. Police say she reported having being sexually assaulted in her hotel room in the early hours of the following day.
Lt-Col Davies was arrested and charged earlier this week.
He has since been released but was ordered to surrender his passport and has been barred from leaving Ontario ahead of a court appearance.
"We are aware of an investigation being conducted by Kingston Police into an alleged incident that took place in April this year involving a serving British army officer," a British army spokesman said.
"As the case is sub judice it would be inappropriate to make any comment."

article Facial reconstruction experts at the university developed images of the king's head from the skeletal remains found buried under a car park in 2012.
The remains of the 15th century monarch were re-buried at Leicester Cathedral this week.
The new painting is based on both the reconstruction and old portraits.
Richard III died in 1485 at Bosworth Field during the Wars of the Roses, and his remains were found buried under a car park in Leicester more than 520 years later.
Facial reconstruction experts at the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification at Dundee University developed an image of the king's head from photographs and scans of the skeleton.
Janice Aitken, an artist based at the university's Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, worked with the CAHID team while painting an up to date portrait of the last Plantagenet king.
She also referenced a portrait painted by an unknown artist between 1504 and 1520, which hangs in Windsor Castle.
Ms Aitken said: "There are many copies of paintings of Richard III but I understand that there are no paintings of him directly from life in existence.
"I thought that it would be interesting to add to the visual record by combining the recent reconstruction with a work that was probably painted by a contemporary of the king."
She said being involved with the project, which led to the skeletal remains being reburied at Leicester Cathedral, had been "incredible".
"I was completely unprepared for the impact that the reconstruction would have. The story of the discovery of the remains of Richard III seems to have resonated across the world."
summary The remains of King Edward VII have been found in a car park in Edinburgh.

article Meanwhile, Aberdeen Asset Management extended a suspension of its fund.
The latest moves add to a flurry of suspensions this week as fund managers seek to prevent a stampede to the exit following the vote to leave the EU.
Investors are worried that a move to leave the European Union will send commercial property prices tumbling.
L&G has cut its Â£2.3bn ($2.99bn) UK property fund by a further 10%, following a previous 5% valuation cut.
Including Aberdeen, at least seven property funds have suspended trading following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
Aberdeen Asset Management extended a suspension of its fund to 11 July on Thursday after announcing a 17% cut to its value.
It initially said on Wednesday it would pause the fund for 24 hours.
Henderson, Canada Life and Threadneedle became the latest on Wednesday to close their doors to traders looking to sell.
That followed similar moves by M&G, Aviva and Standard Life, which have all restricted access to their funds this week.
The large number of investors trying to sell their holdings in the funds is putting pressure on the fund managers to sell properties they own at sharp discounts, said the manager of one suspended fund.
"Sellers requiring liquidity are having to market properties at sometimes significant discounts to their recent valuations," said Martin Gilbert, chief executive at Aberdeen Asset Management.
The vote to leave the EU has led investors to worry that there may be significant falls in commercial property, while the impact on house prices is also being closely watched.
"At this time, it is still difficult to predict the exact impact of the vote to leave and subsequent market events on commercial property values," Legal & General Investment Management said in a statement.

article Chances were few and far between in a poor Championship game at St Andrew's, as Forest failed to land a single effort on target, while Blues only had three.
Forest's 1,474 away fans kept up their protests at owner Fawaz Al Hasawi.
But the point for the up-for-sale club ended a run of five straight defeats.
Forest have not won in eight games, however, since beating leaders Newcastle on 2 December - and head coach Philippe Montanier's future remains uncertain.
The proposed takeover by a United States-based consortium led by John Jay Moores collapsed on Friday, according to Fawaz, although the club have been allowed to come out of their transfer embargo.
Not even the return of midweek signing Craig Gardner for his first Birmingham appearance in five and a half years could help muster a goal.
Gardner had scored on his previous Blues appearance, the day they were relegated from the Premier League in a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham on 22 May 2011.
But after completing his loan move back to St Andrew's from neighbours West Bromwich Albion, his appearance as a 54th-minute substitute for Maikel Kieftenbeld was the highlight of the day for the home fans.
Although Forest had to survive a 30-minute spell of intense second-half pressure, the visitors kept a clean sheet for only the second time this season, thanks to saves by goalkeeper Stephen Henderson from Che Adams, Kieftenbeld and a Lukas Jutkiewicz header.
With uncertainty over his future, Henri Lansbury was again left out, Forest's rivals Derby County, Blues' neighbours Aston Villa and Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic having all been linked with a move for the midfielder.
Birmingham City manager Gianfranco Zola:
"In the first half we kept the ball too much in front of our defenders but, saying that, Forest defended in depth and did not allow us to find any spaces. In the second half, when Craig Gardner and David  Cotterill came on, they created a better atmosphere.
"There was probably a second half penalty but it was not easy the way Nottingham Forest defended. When a team is so tight defensively it is difficult to break them down.
"We didn't concede a goal, which was very encouraging - and Gardner's first game was really positive. Obviously we need that first win as it would be very important for the morale of the players. It is coming."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"It was a positive point and a clean sheet. We did not disappoint in halting a bad run. The team showed good character and good mentality with a fine defensive attitude.
"The role of the head coach or manager is always in danger. It is part of my job. I have told the owners that the most important thing is the team and the club, not my position. I am not selfish, I am always focused on the team."
"We now have to plan quickly to strengthen the squad. Decisions have to be taken now, instead of two or three days before the deadline. It is difficult because we do not have any money but I need to know exactly what I can I can plan and decide. I have targets but I do not know my budget. I need to have a meeting with the chairman for some advice on what we can do together."

article Winnie Johnson, 78, died on Friday night after a long campaign to get her son's killer, Ian Brady, to reveal the location of his body.
Twelve-year-old Keith was abducted on his way to visit his grandmother in Manchester on 16 June 1964.
Mrs Johnson's death comes after police said they were looking at claims Brady had revealed details about his grave.
Brady and his lover Myra Hindley murdered five children between 1963 and 1965.
Police are investigating whether Brady, 74, gave details about Keith's grave to his mental health advocate, Jackie Powell, from Carmarthenshire.
By Judith MoritzNorth of England correspondent, on Saddleworth Moor
Saddleworth Moor straddles the boundary between Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. Its terrain is vast and stark.
Saturday's bright weather has brought walkers and cyclists out, but often this moorland is bleak and unforgiving. It has also gained notoriety as the location chosen by murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, who brought children up here to be killed in the 1960s and then hid their bodies.
Winnie Johnson lived her life in Manchester, nearly 30 miles away. But she's associated with these moors. She used to come up here to look for her son's remains and on Saturday night some of her friends have made the journey here to lay flowers in her memory.
They remember her courage, they say, and there are some who see her as an extra victim of Brady and Hindley. Now her family say they will carry on her fight on her behalf.
Mrs Johnson's solicitor John Ainley told the BBC she did not know about the latest development as "she wasn't capable of accepting it".
Mr Ainley, who described Mrs Johnson as a "really marvellous" lady, said she had been suffering from cancer for a number of years and passed away peacefully at a hospice with her family present.
A statement by her son Alan Bennett said: "She was a much loved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, and is survived by one younger brother.
"Winnie fought tirelessly for decades to find Keith and give him a Christian burial.
"Although this was not possible during her lifetime, we, her family, intend to continue this fight now for her and for Keith. We hope that the authorities and the public will support us in this."
Mr Ainley, who had represented Mrs Johnson's legal interests in the past few years, reaffirmed her beliefs that Brady still held the key to Keith's burial spot.
"Over the years and in all our personal meetings, Winnie has insisted Brady is the only person who could put her mind to rest and give her the chance to give Keith a decent burial before she passed away," he said.
Mr Ainley added that Brady had persistently ignored appeals she had made to him.
"She has died without knowing Keith's whereabouts and without the opportunity to finally put him at rest in a decent grave," he said.
"It is a truly heartbreaking situation that this opportunity has now been irrevocably lost."
The solicitor said he was sceptical about the latest development, saying: "I live on the edge of Saddleworth Moor and unless you have definite information, it is a needle in a haystack."
Martin Bottomley, Head of Investigative Review of Greater Manchester Police's Major and Cold Case Crime Unit, called on Brady to "do the decent thing and tell us where he [Keith] is."
He described Mrs Johnson as a "tenacious and courageous woman" who was "now at peace with the little boy she missed so much".
Mrs Johnson's former solicitor, David Kirwan, said her death was a "cruel and ironic twist".
He added: "She never gave up... She was Keith's mother."

article A number of the mammals have washed ashore with bullet wounds, hacked-off fins and in one case a missing jaw.
One dolphin was found off Alabama with a screwdriver in its head over the summer, while another had its tail cut off, but survived.
Dolphins are protected by the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act.
Under the law, harming a dolphin can lead to fines of up to $10,000 and a prison term of one year.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) has appealed for people along the US Gulf Coast to watch out for dead or injured dolphins.
"There have been some obviously intentional cases," said Erin Fougeres, of Noaa.
She said some mutilations might have happened after the animals died, but that scientists would need to perform necropsies to learn more.
The Associated Press reports that three dolphins have been shot in Louisiana since 2011, and that three others have been found with fatal bullet wounds this year in Mississippi, the most recent one last week.
Moby Solangi, executive director of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport, Mississippi, said: "They [dolphins] come close to the boats, so if you're out there, you'll see them riding the bows.
"And their curiosity and friendship brings them so close that they become targets and that's the unfortunate thing."
The attacks follow two bad years for the Gulf dolphin population: in 2010, a number of the mammals stranded themselves along the coast, possibly due to a cold winter.
The Deepwater Horizon fire and oil spill later that year contributed further to dolphin deaths. Scientists have recorded more than 700 such fatalities since February 2010.
Some have suggested a few angry fisherman might be responsible for the mutilations, given dolphins sometimes steal bait used by the boats.

article Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the troops would be partnered with 100 New Zealand military personnel.
The mission's purpose is to help train the Iraqi army so that it can gain and hold ground against Islamic State (IS) militants, he said.
The mission, to be based about 30 miles north of the capital Baghdad, is expected to be operational by May.
The deployment was first announced in March.  The new additions will leave on Wednesday.
"We won't have a combat role. It is a training mission not a combat mission," Mr Abbott told journalists at a press conference in Canberra on Tuesday. "I can't tell you that this is risk free."
"The work of the coalition against the Islamist death cult has been effective," he went on, referring to IS.
"We have seen the Iraqis retake [the city of] Tikrit... we have seen incremental gains by the Iraqi forces and the Kurdish forces," he said, while conceding that large swathes of Iraq remained out of the Iraqi government's control.
He said IS was not just terrorising Iraq and Syria "but is reaching out to Australia", making Australia's involvement in the conflict an issue of national security.
Australia joined the fight against IS last September and has already sent six F/A18 fighter jets, 200 special forces and 400 military support staff.
The Australian government estimates that about 90 Australian citizens are fighting with IS in Syria and Iraq and another 140 citizens in Australia are offering the group support.
The new training mission will be formally reviewed after 12 months.

article The jobless rate is now 5.8%, compared with 5% for the whole of the UK.
But employment in Scotland fell by 48,000 over the three months to a total of 2,580,000.
The employment rate is now 73.2% - below the UK average of 74.2%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) .
The number of people claiming Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA) fell by 500 between April and May to 57,100. The figure is 19,200 lower than a year ago.
Meanwhile, UK unemployment fell by 20,000 to 1.67 million between February and April. The UK jobless rate is at its lowest since 2005.
Analysis by Douglas Fraser, Scotland business/economy editor
The unemployment numbers are down, and account for half of the total UK fall. So that's good, isn't it?
Well, up to a point. The other side of that coin is employment - the number of people IN work in the February to April labour market survey.
And that's been heading in the wrong direction, at a much faster speed than the latest drop in job-seeker numbers.

The UK government's Scottish Secretary David Mundell, said: "It is welcome news that unemployment has fallen by 11,000 over the three months to April, but these figures also show that the downturn in the oil and gas sector is having a significant, ongoing, impact.
"The UK government is continuing to work with the Scottish government and other partners to do everything possible to support the North Sea industry and boost Scotland's economy."
The Scottish government said Scotland outperformed the rest of the UK on youth employment, unemployment and inactivity rates.
Minister for Employability and Training Jamie Hepburn said: "The latest employment figures show a fall in unemployment over the last quarter which is to be welcomed.
"However, as the employment rate has fallen we are clear we need to increase our efforts to improve the economy by investing in jobs and creating a competitive and supportive business environment."
Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) general secretary Grahame Smith said: "It can no longer be denied that 2016 is turning into a wretched year for the Scottish labour market.
"The small fall in unemployment must not be used to disguise the very significant fall in employment and concomitant rise in economic inactivity.
"Only Scotland among the nations and regions of the UK has seen its employment rate fall over the past year and its unemployment rate flat-line."

article Jack Adcock, of Glen Parva, died after being admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with pneumonia in 2011.
Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who denies manslaughter due to negligence, believed he had a "do not resuscitate" order, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Two nurses also deny charges of manslaughter by gross negligence.
Giving evidence, Dr Bawa-Garba, 38, said she was called to a ward where an emergency team was trying to save Jack's life after he had been admitted earlier in the day.
Before entering the room, she said she saw Jack's mother by the door and confused her with the mother of another child, who was marked do not resuscitate.
She told the crash team to stop, but when a doctor told her it was Jack, she ordered resuscitation to start again.
The jury was told the youngster was already beyond the point of no return, but the prosecution said the "remarkable error" showed how he was neglected by Dr Bawa-Garba.
Dr Bawa Garba said there was a lot of miscommunication and afterwards she was "blaming herself a lot."
The doctor also told the court how she missed two abnormal blood tests for Jack.
She said she had called a technician to get the results over the phone after the hospital computer failed, but added she could not remember writing them down.
Asked by her defence barrister if she had missed the abnormal results, she replied: "I have thought and reflected on this and yes I did miss these results."
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and died on 18 February 2011 from a cardiac arrest after sepsis was triggered by a bacterial infection.
The two other hospital workers on trial are Sister Theresa Taylor, 55, and 47-year-old Portuguese-born agency nurse Isabel Amaro.
The trial continues.

article Figures obtained by the BBC show 1,099 forged documents were seized at ports and airports in 2014, the last year for which statistics were available.
The Home Office declined to provide figures for individual ports.
It said disclosure would prejudice the prevention and detection of crime or the operation of immigration controls.
Figures include existing passports that have been tampered with and documents counterfeited from scratch.

The Home Office (HO) replied to an FoI request from BBC Radio Kent, which also requested a breakdown in seizures at the Port of Dover, through British border checks in Calais, and the Eurotunnel terminals in Folkestone and Calais.
But after careful consideration, the HO decided not to issue the breakdown having decided it was exempt from disclosure in the public interest.
Counter-terrorism expert Bob Milton said fake passports enabled the likes of terrorists and extremists to travel freely across the world.
"It is a huge problem because it is hiding people's identity," he said.
Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said one of the biggest issues was dealing with the "bureaucratic systems" of other countries.
"It is not British passports that are being exploited in this way, although they are open to that," she said.
"All we can do is to ensure that our border controls are as strong as they can be."
In a statement, the Home Office said: "Protecting our borders has always been - and remains - a top priority.
"All passports are inspected by Border Force officers in the UK to make sure the owners of fraudulent documents are prevented from entering the country."
summary The Home Office has said it is investigating the use of forged documents in the UK.

article A study for the Ambition School Leadership charity found deprived youngsters in these six areas were 20.1 months behind at GCSE level.
Schools minister Nick Gibb said it showed the importance of targeting support at areas that were "the most challenged when it comes to social mobility".
There have been six opportunity areas named by the government so far - Norwich, Blackpool, Derby, Oldham, Scarborough and West Somerset - with the promise of more to follow.
There will be Â£60m of extra spending to promote social mobility in these areas, such as linking schools to businesses, universities and careers advisers.
The study shows how far "persistently disadvantaged" pupils - who have been eligible for free school meals for four out of five years - have fallen behind in secondary school.
They were found to be the equivalent of 20.1 months behind the average for children who were not on free school meals in other parts of England.
Pupils in the "opportunity areas" who were not on free school meals were also behind their counterparts in other parts of England - by 4.7 months.
The study looked at pupil achievement between 2010 and 2015 and found that the gap had widened.
Ambition School Leadership has been created from bringing together two education charities, Future Leaders Trust and Teaching Leaders, which had worked to improve school leadership, particularly in disadvantaged areas.
James Toop, chief executive of the new charity, said: "We know great leaders at all levels make great schools. We're going to be working even harder to reach these schools and give the children they serve a great education."
School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said the study showed the need for the government's plans to "make more good school places available, to more parents, in more parts of the country".
He said this would include "scrapping the ban on new grammar school places and harnessing the resources and expertise of universities, independent and faith schools".
"This report underlines the need to focus our efforts in the areas identified as the most challenged when it comes to social mobility."
A separate study from the the Education Policy Institute looked at Ofsted inspections in schools with a more disadvantaged intake.
The researchers claimed inspectors were more likely to have harsh judgments on schools with higher proportions of pupils on free school meals - and that they could be too generous to those with a wealthier intake.
An Ofsted spokeswoman rejected this claim, saying that inspectors would "mark down coasting schools in leafy suburbs where we see pupils not making as much progress as they should".
"Similarly, we do recognise schools in more deprived areas where children are making good progress."

article Homes were ruined and the clean-up cost a fortune.
Northern Ireland Water suffered its worst ever crisis as more than a million calls were made to its helpline and people tried to use its website - but it wasn't prepared.
As a result it bore the brunt of public anger and frustration, and it led to the resignation of its chief executive.
"We have very painful memories in NI Water of what happened, especially when we consider the experience of our customers during that time," said Sarah Venning from Northern Ireland Water.
"We have doubled the amount of call handlers we have available.  We've taken a website which had a capacity of 20,000 visits per day to a capacity of 200,000 visits per hour and we've almost tripled the stock of bottled water that we're holding now" she added.
Motorists too were badly affected as snow and ice built up on the roads. The roads service battled against the snow to keep the roads open. Thousands of tonnes of salt were spread.
That salt comes from deep underground just outside Carrickfergus in County Antrim.
Huge machines chop away at the walls of the salt mine to give us the grit we need to help keep life in Northern Ireland as normal as possible during the winter months.
Workers travel so deep underground it's like scaling down the length of the Empire State Building in New York.
The roads below, laid out straight, would stretch from Belfast to Newry.
Ironically the road network in the mine will never need salted as it is warm underground all year round.
Inside the salt is crushed by giant machines until the grains are about the width of a pen.
And when it's ready, up to 4,000 tonnes every day are brought to the surface.
"It was extremely busy for us, it was our busiest year on record," David Lee, from the Irish Salt Mining Company, said.
"We supplied more than 100,000 tonnes of salt to the local road service.
"Unfortunately our own production here couldn't meet the increased demand that we had, so we brought some salt in from Egypt."
Stormont will give out cold weather payments of £25 again this year when temperatures are recorded or forecast to be zero or below for seven days in a row.
However, people over the age of 60 will see a cut in their winter fuel allowance, some by as much as £100.
It will mean that six in ten pensioners will struggle to heat their homes this winter, so if the big freeze hits again it will be even more challenging.
In fact it could be difficult for all of us, especially if the preparations made by the authorities aren't enough.
You can see more of Barra Best's reports on how NI is preparing for winter weather on Tuesday and Wednesday on BBC Newsline on BBC One at 18:30 GMT.
summary The water crisis in Northern Ireland has been described as "a disaster of epic proportions".

article A 53-page report has highlighted efforts to boost freight and passenger numbers as key drivers of success.
The business review document also places importance on Prestwick's bid to become the UK's first spaceport.
The Scottish government bought the struggling airport for £1 last year and later announced £10m in loan funding.
The cash was committed towards operating costs, a repairs backlog and to make improvements to the terminal building.
The long-term strategy has been based upon reports and recommendations from a senior advisor appointed by TS Prestwick Holdco Ltd, the holding company that was created by the Scottish government to buy shares in the airport and oversee its corporate governance.
The strategic vision said the Ayrshire terminal's association with Glasgow, some 35 miles away, was its "best asset".
A local campaign to change its name to Robert Burns International Airport, in recognition of the Alloway-born bard, would "damage the airport's business prospects, notably with inbound passengers", it said.
The vision also confirms Prestwick's bid to be the site of the UK's first spaceport, which it said will be "the catalyst for transformational change".
In the meantime, Prestwick faces some challenges including aged infrastructure, a maintenance backlog, a railway station in need of a £4.75m refurbishment, the need for a new primary radar within the next five years and Ryanair's expansion into Glasgow Airport.
The vision also said Scottish airports were "disproportionally affected" by air passenger duty (APD) due to their geographic location and Prestwick is calling for changes to UK aviation policy leading to a reduction in or removal of APD.
Prestwick chief executive Iain Cochrane said: "Our long-term vision for Glasgow Prestwick, which is shared by the Scottish government, is of a high-quality, exceptional value and vibrant aviation, aerospace and visitor hub.
"We aim to ensure that it becomes the busy and prosperous strategic anchor for economic growth and delivery in Ayrshire and Scotland that we strongly believe it can be.
"The document outlines the plans for investment, development and the optimum operating structure required to take the airport forward to achieve this long-term vision."
Mr Cochrane said there was widespread acceptance that there was no "no quick fix solution" to problems faced by the airport.
He said the possibility of Prestwick bidding to become the UK's first spaceport presented the airport with "another significant opportunity".
Mr Cochrane said: "We satisfy - and in some cases exceed - all the essential criteria such as infrastructure, weather and airspace, and securing spaceport status would be the catalyst for transformational change at the airport - from boosting revenue from space-related flight testing, establishing an attractive modernised hi-tech image and bringing in visitors and tourists.
"It will also bring significant economic benefits to both Ayrshire and Scotland. Our team is therefore firmly focused on winning the bid."
Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the aim was to transform Prestwick into "a successful and vibrant airport".
She said: "The management team has built on the work of the senior advisor and this document outlines their investment and business development plans, as well as the operating structure that is being put in place to take the airport forward.
"We have been clear from the start of this process that there is no quick fix for the airport but there are opportunities to improve in all areas of the business, from increasing passenger and freight traffic to putting forward a bid for the UK Spaceport programme.
"We are confident there is a place for Glasgow Prestwick Airport in the evolving Scottish aviation market and look forward to seeing it grow and develop in the future."
Scottish Labour's infrastructure spokesman, James Kelly MSP, said that a year on from its sale, "workers have no sense of what direction the Scottish government will take Prestwick Airport".
He said: "Prestwick Airport is absolutely vital to the economy of the west of Scotland, supporting thousands of jobs. Yet despite the heavy investment of taxpayers money we are no further forward on how these jobs will be secured long term.
"The SNP need to get their head out of the clouds. Workers in Ayrshire deserve a clear plan that will safeguard existing jobs and create more, not the Nicola Sturgeon International Airport."
Conservative transport spokesman Alex Johnstone said the report should be "the launch pad for a focused plan of action from the Scottish and UK governments" and urged First Minister Alex Salmond and Ms Sturgeon to make it "their top priority".
"The UK Government's ambition to open a spaceport by 2018 is a tremendously exciting opportunity for Scotland and Prestwick stands in great shape to win the bidding process," he said.
"We urge Scottish ministers to do everything in their power to support it."
summary The future of Prestwick Airport is being shaped by a new report.

article But building road and rail networks is expensive and difficult.
The World Bank estimates that Africa needs to spend $38bn (Â£25bn) more each year on infrastructure - plus a further $37bn on operations and maintenance - just to sustain its current level of development.
So what's the answer?
Could it be cargo drones - or "flying donkeys" as one Kenyan farmer put it?
Afrotech, a technology innovation project set up by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, certainly thinks so.
Director Jonathan Ledgard, a former foreign correspondent in Africa, thinks they will enable the continent to leapfrog traditional infrastructure development and grow faster economically.
Next year, through its spin-off company Red/Blue, Afrotech will begin testing cargo drones capable of carrying small packages across distances of up to 80km (50 miles).
The first route will be a "red line" flying units of blood to remote health clinics.
"We want to prove very robustly that we can clinically save lives and improve medical outcomes by using cargo drones," says Mr Ledgard.
But where exactly these routes will be is still up for negotiation.
The consortium is currently talking to a handful of governments in East, Central and Southern Africa over the acquisition of 10,000 sq km of airspace for three years to test the concept.
The hope is that once the "red line" humanitarian routes have been established and proven to work, this will open up the potential for "blue line" - in other words commercial services - to operate in cities.
"What we are trying is going to be faster, cheaper and more precise delivering," he says. "Physical terrestrial infrastructure is not going to be enough by a long shot.
"The big money - and it will be huge money - will be in the commercial blue line. Industry will take care of that."
He envisages e-commerce companies using cargo drones for deliveries, literally rising above Africa's poor transport infrastructure.
"There will be big money, billions of dollars, in these blue lines within a decade, I'm sure of it," he says.
Drones could account for 10%-to-15% of Africa's transport sector in the next decade, he believes.
But are "flying donkeys" really a feasible option for Africa?
University of Southampton's Professor Jim Scanlan, who is testing the potential for cargo drones in Scotland's Shetland and Orkney Islands, believes so.
In the same way that Africa embraced the mobile phone and leapfrogged fixed line telephony, "they will do the same with transportation," he says. "It is so expensive to put in road or rail networks, so they will start using drones."
In his test areas, where adverse weather conditions make driving cars and flying aircraft difficult, Prof Scanlan says drones are proving their worth.
"Drones would be safer, and save lives. And it is cheap," he says, adding that his team could currently build a functioning drone for the cost of a traditional white van.
Oliver Evans, chief cargo officer of Swiss International Air Lines, thinks there is "no doubt" that unmanned vehicles are one of the most exciting new technologies.
"If they sound exotic, outlandish, or even threatening due to their application in the single field of warfare, that is only due to the general lack of awareness or imagination," he says.
But the lifting capability of drones will be an issue. Current civilian drone technology limits cargo package weight to about 20lb (9kg) maximum.
Adding more rotors to a helicopter-style drone gives you more lift but requires more battery power. This adds weight which then reduces the distance you can travel before needing a recharge.
Fixed wing drones will also be a possibility as they are more aerodynamic and efficient over longer distances.
But copter drones have the advantage that they can take off and land vertically in tight spaces.
Whatever their shape, cargo drones capable of carrying 20-30kg efficiently are unlikely to be in operation until around until 2021 or 2022, Mr Ledgard believes.
"But they are inevitable and they are going to be transformative," he says.
The Flying Donkey Challenge, run by La Fondation Bundi and supported by EPFL and the Swiss National Centre of Competence for Research in Robotics (NCCR), is giving grants to fund drone development in the hope that these physical limitations can be overcome.
Tomorrow's Transport is a series exploring innovation in all forms of future mobility.
The Challenge will culminate in a race of flying donkeys around Mount Kenya in under 24 hours, delivering and collecting 20kg payloads as they go.
Yves Rossy, known as Jetman for his habit of scorching through the air with a rocket-powered fixed-wing strapped to his back, is an advisory board member of the Flying Donkey Challenge.
But it's not just technology that needs to improve to make flying donkeys a reality in Africa.
Governments and safety authorities need to put in place regulatory frameworks to accommodate this new form of transport.
Where will they be allowed to fly? What happens if they crash and damage property or people? Who will be allowed to operate them? Could they be hijacked?
But Mr Ledgard believes Africa has a golden opportunity to lead the world in making cargo drones practical, reliable and safe.
"Ironically, the US FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] isn't going to legislate on drones effectively in the next few years, so this is an opportunity for African countries to be at the cutting edge of new technology and one that makes sense for them."
Nigerian's aviation minister, Osita Chidoka, told the BBC: "We need to address the airspace management and regulatory issues, the safety concerns and the economics, but there's a possibility that in 10 years we'll see cargo drones flying across East and West Africa.
"Technological development is happening at the speed of light, so anything that helps us leapfrog the need for transport infrastructure has to be taken very seriously."
summary Africa's infrastructure needs are huge, with the continent's population growing by a third

article Saints led 2-0 inside 12 minutes after Liam Craig's opener from the penalty spot and a header from Graham Cummins.
But the hosts were level by the 21st minute, Arnaud Djoum looping a header in before Joe Shaughnessy's own goal.
Hearts had striker Abiola Dauda sent off for a lunge after 57 minutes, but held on as Saints threatened a winner.
Alim Ozturk denied Danny Swanson and Steven MacLean fired wide, before one final chance saw Tam Scobbie's header saved brilliantly by Hamilton.
But the visitors had to settle for remaining unbeaten in their final five matches.
They finished nine points adrift of Hearts in third, but both sides can take satisfaction from excellent seasons.
The Hearts players revealed a banner before kick-off thanking their fans for their "incredible" support during the season, and another full house of 16,046 were treated to a feast of early goals.
Hearts almost had the perfect start when Djoum found space on the edge of the 18-yard box but his shot was deflected wide for a corner.
Saints took the lead in the ninth minute when John Souttar tangled with Cummins in the box from a long throw-in.
Referee Greg Aitken pointed to the spot despite the hosts' protests and Craig fired the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.
Saints doubled their advantage three minutes later as the home defence again failed to cope with a set piece, Cummins meeting a corner from the left on the volley for his eighth goal of the season.
Hearts looked as if they were going to be overrun by Tommy Wright's hungry side but they bounced back quickly when Djoum sent a looping header beyond Alan Mannus into the top corner.
And Robbie Neilson's side were back on level terms four minutes later.
Prince Buaben sent in a cross aimed at top scorer Juanma, but Shaughnessy arrived first and sent a header over his own goalkeeper into the net.
Hearts' players now looked as if they believed in themselves and only the feet of Mannus denied Dauda the lead.
The recalled keeper then made a wonderful save from the same player moments late, diving low to his right to keep his goal intact.
Danny Swanson looked as if he had regained the lead for Saints with an angled shot from close range but a last-gasp clearance from Callum Paterson kept the sides level at the interval.
Saints striker Chris Kane missed a good chance when clean through on goal, clipping the ball over Jack Hamilton but also over the Hearts crossbar.
Challenges were flying in from both teams with referee Aitken struggling to keep control of affairs.
And the home side were reduced to 10 men when Dauda saw red for a thumping challenge on Craig, who was fortunate to avoid a card himself for his reaction.
Only Hamilton in the Hearts goal stood back as the other 21 players on the pitch joined the melee that followed.
Hearts continued to press forward despite being a man down and Alim Ozturk's free-kick brought another wonderful save from Mannus.
But after Ozturk denied Danny Swanson and MacLean fired wide, Saints had one final chance but Tam Scobbie's header was brilliantly saved by Hamilton.

article Peta Hiku put the Super League hosts ahead and, after both sides were denied a try by the video referee, Chester Butler made it 4-4 at the break.
Chris Hill restored Wolves' lead, only for Butler to respond again.
Russell brilliantly rose to claim the hosts' third from a cross-field kick, before Andre Savelio completed the win.
Warrington Wolves boss Tony Smith:
"We were a little flat in the first half and we had to respond in the second half and we did. We probably didn't nail a few chances in first half when we were held up two or three times over the line and had some dubious obstruction calls and if you nail those it gives the whole game a different perspective.
"It was a tough game because the ruck was slow and Halifax did what they had to. Credit to how the defended because they knew they needed to slow us down to keep in the game and they were allowed to.
"Playing against a Championship team you learn some stuff, but I thought we had a Championship standard referee today and that's going to happen to us from time to time.
"We have to be able to cope with that and come out on top regardless of that. Halifax haven't given up all year and that's why they are in the position they are in terms of making it to the Qualifiers and Richard Marshall has done a great job with them there."
Halifax boss Richard Marshall:
"We are a proud bunch and I'm a proud coach today and I thought we had the opportunity to win the game.
"In the first half with some smarter decisions with ball we could have scored a couple more tries. We did force the pass, but we had to when you are playing one of the best teams in this competition and in Super League.
"Warrington have some world class players, but I thought our enthusiasm was world class and our attitude to defend for your team-mates was outstanding and that goes a long way with me.
"We didn't win the game, but we certainly got a few wins internally in that performance."

article Hubert Cadenne de Lannoy, 36, from Newtown, Powys, was manager of the town's Dyfed Steels when he diverted business to his Agri Steels operation.
de Lannoy pleaded guilty to fraud at Mold Crown Court.
He had a 16-month jail sentence suspended for 18 months, was ordered to carry out 180 hours unpaid work and pay £23,000 compensation.
The court heard that de Lannoy had been manager at Dyfed Steels since 2007, with the deception taking place in 2013 and 2014.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel said de Lannoy had claimed steel was being cut wrongly.
But he was then taking excess amounts and offering it through Agri Steels for about 10% cheaper.
In total, the court heard de Lannoy used £23,244 worth of Dyfed Steels' products to fulfil orders for his company.
Defence barrister John Hedgecoe said de Lannoy now employed six people at Agri Steels and could repay the money if allowed to continue trading.
Judge Eleri Rees called it "a cynical exercise", saying: "You were employed in a position of some trust being a general manager and set up your own company and started to siphon off orders and materials to your own company."

article Prosopagnosia, as doctors call it, affects around two in every 100 people in the UK and is the inability to recognise people by their faces alone.
In its most extreme form, people cannot even recognise their family or friends.
Milder forms, while still distressing, can be tricky to diagnose, which is why tests are needed.
People with prosopagnosia often use non-facial cues to recognise others, such as their hairstyle, clothes, voice, or distinctive features.
Some may be unaware they have the condition, instead believing they have a "bad memory for faces". But prosopagnosia is entirely unrelated to intelligence or broader memory ability.
One [anonymous] person with prosopagnosia explains: "My biggest problem is seeing the difference between ordinary-looking people, especially faces with few specific traits.
"I work at a hospital with an awful lot of employees and I often introduce myself to colleagues with whom I have worked several times before. I also often have problems recognising my next-door neighbour, even though we have been neighbours for eight years now. She often changes clothes, hairstyle and hair colour. When I strive to recognise people, I try to use technical clues like clothing, hairstyle, scars, glasses, their dialect and so on."
Doctors can use computer-based tests to see if people can spot famous faces and memorise and recognise a set of unfamiliar faces.
And now Dr Pundit Shah and colleagues at University College London have come up with a 20-item questionnaire to help measure the severity of someone's face blindness.
Each question is scored out of five, giving a total score of up to 100, but the abridged version below, created with the help of Dr Shah, gives a score out of 50.
Try our version of the prosopagnosia test here
The test is a guide and cannot tell you definitively whether you have face blindness or not.
If you think you have face blindness and would like to be involved in Prof Shah's Medical Research Council-funded work, you can get in touch via the Trouble with Faces website.

article Philando Castile's girlfriend live-streamed the St Paul incident's aftermath, showing him covered in blood as an officer pointed his gun at him.
He was shot as he reached for his driving licence, she said.
It follows the death of Alton Sterling, who was shot dead by police during an incident in Baton Rouge on Tuesday.
Hundreds of people have protested for two nights over Mr Sterling's killing.
The deaths follow a long line of high-profile incidents involving African-Americans dying at the hands of the police, igniting a national debate about the use of lethal force.
As news of the latest shooting spread, about 200 people protested outside the St Paul home of Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who later requested a federal investigation into the shooting.
In a statement on Facebook, President Barack Obama said all Americans "should be deeply troubled" by the two fatal shootings.
He said it was clear that they were not isolated incidents but "symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system".
Black US tennis player Serena Williams, who is playing at the Wimbledon tournament, also expressed her dismay at news of Mr Castile's death, tweeting: "In London I have to wake up to this. He was black. Shot 4 times? When will something be done - no REALLY be done?!"
Mr Castile had been stopped in Falcon Heights, a suburb of St Paul, because the car had a broken rear light, the woman, identified in local media reports as Diamond Reynolds (or sometimes as Lavish Reynolds) said.
Before he was shot, he had told the officer that he was licensed to carry a concealed gun and had one in his possession, she said.
"You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his licence and registration, sir," Ms Reynolds says in the video.
A child, Ms Reynolds's daughter, was also in the car at the time.
Police said an investigation was under way and the officer involved had been put on leave.
Mr Castile's mother, Valerie Castile, told CNN that her son was just "black in the wrong place" and said there was "a silent war against African-American people".
Later on Thursday, an emotional Ms Reynolds told protesters outside the governor's house that she had filmed the incident so "the world knows that these police are not here to protect and serve us, they are here to assassinate us".
Mr Castile, 32, worked as a cafeteria supervisor at a Montessori school. His cousin Antonio Johnson told the Star Tribune newspaper he was "immediately criminally profiled" because he was black.
In Baton Rouge, hundreds of people gathered for a second night of protests at the shop where Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old father of five, was killed on Tuesday.
Walter Scott - unarmed and shot in the back as he ran away from an officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, in April 2015. Former officer Michael Slager facing murder charge

Michael Brown - 18-year-old shot at least seven times in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, sparking nationwide protests. Officer Darren Wilson cleared of wrongdoing
Eric Garner - died after being placed in a chokehold by New York police while selling cigarettes in July 2014. Grand jury decides against charges, police disciplinary action taken against supervising officer Sgt Kizzy Adonis

people killed by police in 2015
30% of victims were black
13% of US population is black
97% of deaths were not followed by any charges against police officers
A second piece of video from Baton Rouge emerged on Wednesday appearing to show Mr Sterling being held down and then shot several times, although some shots are heard when the camera moves away from the confrontation.
Seconds later, one of the officers is seen removing an object from the man's trousers as he lies on the ground with blood on his chest.
A witness said he saw officers take a gun from Mr Sterling's pocket after the shooting, but police have not commented on this.
Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr said Mr Sterling was armed but that a lot of questions still had to be answered.
The officers involved, Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II, have been put on administrative leave and the US Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation.

article They were arrested on firearms charges in October 2013 when the ship they were on was found to be full of weapons.
The charges were dropped, but the Indian authorities appealed against the decision and have now won their case.
All 35 sailors and guards on the boat received five-year sentences and were ordered to pay 3,000 rupees (Â£30).
The British men sentenced are:
The men were arrested on board a ship owned by an American company which offered armed protection services to vessels sailing through an area known as "pirates' alley" between the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea.
Customs officials and police found 35 guns, including semi-automatic weapons, and almost 6,000 rounds of ammunition on board the ship which did not have permission to be in Indian waters.
A court in Tamil Nadu upheld the claim by the Indian authorities that the vessel was not properly licensed.
The men have consistently denied any wrongdoing and claim they have been abandoned by their American employers.
They also say they have not been paid since November 2013.
Speaking after being convicted, Mr Dunn said: "They have no evidence against us to say we've committed any crime and yet they have found us guilty.
"I have done six months in prison, I've done 27 months in total and now they've sentenced me to do a further five years. This is absolutely disgusting."
Meanwhile John Armstrong said: "I should be surprised but I'm not.
"I'm a bit speechless but I'd seen it coming. We will appeal, but I don't know when because I haven't spoken to the lawyer."
Billy Irving's partner, Yvonne MacHugh, said: "After two long years of fighting to get my partner Billy home I'm devastated with today's verdict.
"For the next five years our son won't have a father at home."
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said that the men had 90 days to appeal against the decision.
A spokesman said: "Our staff in India and the UK have been in close contact with all six men since their arrest to provide support to them and their families, including attending court.
"Ministers have also raised this case at the highest levels, pressing for delays to be resolved.
"We recognise what a difficult time this is for those involved. There is now a 90 day window to appeal and we will continue to provide consular assistance.
"However, we cannot interfere in another country's judicial process."
Ken Peters, director of Justice and Public Affairs at the Mission to Seafarers, said: "To think that highly trained professionals, properly accredited and doing a job that is protecting the world's interests are then penalised in such a way is unthinkable."
Ian Lavery, Labour MP for Wansbeck, said he would continue to campaign for the return home of constituent Mr Dunn and the other men.
He said: "This verdict will have come as a hammer blow to Nick and the other men coming only a matter of months after a court had quashed all of the charges.
"Sadly this bizarre judgment, charging former British servicemen with the maximum penalty for handling arms, means the nightmare continues.
"I will continue to work with Nick's family to fight for his release and return to the UK and am seeking urgent discussions on the way forward and seeking an early resolution to this miscarriage of justice."

article Germany-born Faas won four major photo prizes, including two Pulitzers, during his career, and served as AP's Saigon photo chief at the height of the war.
In Saigon he trained and mentored young Vietnamese photographers who captured many of the war's defining images.
Faas was injured in 1967 and later used a wheelchair for many years.
He died after suffering years of health problems, including paralysis from the waist down.
"Horst Faas was a giant in the world of photojournalism whose extraordinary commitment to telling difficult stories was unique and remarkable," said Santiago Lyon, AP's global head of photography.
"He was an exceptional talent both behind the camera and editing the work of others and even in the grimmest circumstances he always made sure to live life to the fullest," Lyon said.
"He will be sorely missed by scores of colleagues, especially that reduced group with whom he covered conflict, particularly the Vietnam generation."
Speaking to the BBC in 2007, Faas described his job in simple terms.
"I tried to be in the newspapers every day, to beat the opposition with better photos. I didn't try to do anything grandiose. The photos were used and published and asked for, becuase Vietnam was on the front pages year after year after.
"I lived from day to day, from event to event. It was a perfect story for an agency photographer."
He began his career covering conflicts in 1960, four years after joining the Associated Press (AP).
He worked in what was then Zaire, and in Algeria, before relocating to Vietnam, where he won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1965.
Accepting the award, he said he aimed to "record the suffering, the emotions and the sacrifices of both Americans and Vietnamese in... this little bloodstained country so far away," AP said.
He had a front row view of much of that suffering.
When not in the midst of the conflict, Faas worked at AP's Saigon base, viewing and selecting images from his photographers to transmit on the wire to the rest of the world.
Under his direction, AP photographers captured images that quickly became synonymous with the long war: among the most notable were Eddie Adams' image of the execution of a Viet Cong suspect and Nick Ut's picture of a naked Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack.
Despite being injured in 1967, he stayed in the country until 1970.
"I don't think anyone stayed longer, took more risks or showed greater devotion to his work and his colleagues," said New York Times journalist David Halberstam, who once lived with Haas.
"I think of him as nothing less than a genius."

In May, the family were awarded legal aid for the inquest after their initial application was rejected.
Mr and Mrs Shepherd were both at Wakefield Coroners' Court earlier to see the jury sworn in.
The children's mother, Sharon Wood, was also in court.

Yu Tamura's conversion of Amanaki Lotoahea's 76th-minute try almost earned Japan an historic draw in a thrilling international in Cardiff.
Wales had led by 11 points in the second half after tries by Dan Lydiate, Jamie Roberts and Sam Warburton.
Wings Akihito Yamada and Kenki Fukuoka were Japan's other try-scorers.
Leigh Halfpenny scored 15 points with the boot and Japan number eight Amanaki Mafi was named man-of-the-match after a tireless and powerful display.
But it is the 23-year-old Ospreys number 10 Davies who will dominate the headlines after keeping his cool to nail his drop-goal left-footed from 30 metres in only his second international.
It was a rare moment of clarity in a Welsh performance punctuated by errors and a lack of tactical control.
Japan, with fly-half Tamura kicking superbly and Mafi simply magnificent, were worth a draw and were visibly disappointed at the final whistle.
The visitors' refusal to buckle in the face of superior Welsh possession was aided by Wales' unhappy knack of offering up points after scoring themselves.
Twice in the second half Rob Howley's team made a hash of restarts to let Japan back into the game and when Lotoahea juggled Mafi's pass to score his team's third try, it looked as though that would cost Wales dear.
Japan might even have won the game after robbing Wales of possession in the final minutes to break clear, but paid the price when they were turned over and the Welsh drove back downfield.
Howley will be looking for more control against South Africa next week.

Wales made a shambolic start and were trailing by six points and down to 14 men inside eight minutes with Liam Williams in the sin-bin.
A period of relative calm mid-half saw the home team establish forward control and Lydiate's first international try and Roberts' charge from five metres appeared to have restored order.
But far from turning the screw up front, Wales played fast and loose and were punished before the interval when Yamada pounced on Gareth Anscombe's speculative pass and raced 60 yards to score between the posts.
It was the same story after the break, with Warburton's try after great work by Alun Wyn Jones appearing to put Wales in control.
But Japan served up the try of the match through Fukuoka and then a thrilling finish after their third score.
Happily for Wales, Davies kept his head when those around him were losing theirs.

After focusing solely on BMX racing, she returned to the track in 2015 but failed to earn a place at Rio 2016.
Reade will now take up an ambassadorial role at British Cycling.
"I'll always be grateful for the support, training and opportunities British Cycling has provided me with over the years - both on and off the track," said Reade.
"While my BMX and track career with the Great Britain Cycling Team has been both successful and rewarding, I'm now ready to move on from this experience to see what the future holds."
Reade competed in the first ever Olympic women's BMX event at Beijing 2008 but crashed out of the final, also suffering disappointment at London 2012 when she finished sixth.
She and Pendleton also missed out on taking a third straight team sprint world title in 2009 as they were beaten by Australian pair Kaarle McCulloch and Anna Meares in the final.

article Protests have been held at the Little Plumpton site since shale gas extraction was approved in 2016.
More officers are needed as activity increases, costing an extra £200k this financial year, said a spokesman.
Last month, the Home Office said the force would "continue to have" resources "to keep communities safe".
Planning permission for energy firm Cuadrilla to carry out fracking at the Preston New Road site was initially declined by Lancashire County Council, but that decision was overturned by Communities Minister Sajid Javid in October.
Protests have been held regularly at the site since initial works began in January.
Energy firm Cuadrilla has said drilling would start in the spring.
It would mean that, for the first time, UK shale rock will be drilled horizontally, which is expected to yield more gas. However, the process has prompted environmental concerns.
A force spokesman said the additional £450,000 a month policing cost would be kept under review and published.
"We also estimate we will have spent up to £200k additional costs in the current financial year.
"The increase is because activity at the site is increasing and so are the number of officers there."

article The explosion targeted a checkpoint and left the nearby police HQ in ruins.
The banned Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, said it was behind the attack. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim vowed to give the "vile attackers the answer they deserve".
Cizre has often been under curfew since last July when a two-year ceasefire with the PKK collapsed, heralding a return to deadly violence.
The UN and human rights organisations have demanded an investigation into allegations that more than 100 people were burned to death while sheltering in basements in Cizre during one of those curfews.
The Turkish government has rejected allegations that it targeted civilians.
A string of PKK attacks have targeted Turkish security forces recently.
On Friday, the Kurdish militants denied deliberately targeting Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the secularist Republican People's Party (CHP), near the north-eastern city of Artvin, on Thursday.
Mr Kilicdaroglu escaped unharmed.
Turkish military operations in the south-east and retaliatory attacks by the PKK have left hundreds of people dead.
Turkey's PKK conflict shows no sign of abating, says the BBC's Mark Lowen, and the government has ruled out any negotiations until the group completely disarms.
The latest violence comes as the army reels from a huge purge following a coup attempt in July.
As well as fighting the PKK, Turkey is battling so-called Islamic State, whose militants have carried out a series of bloody attacks over the past year.
The PKK, which is banned in Turkey, launched its insurgency in 1984, alleging widespread abuse and discrimination against Kurds by Turkish authorities.

article Ken Cheng won the 10th annual Dave's Funniest Joke Of The Fringe with: "I'm not a fan of the new pound coin, but then again, I hate all change."
The joke, from his show Ken Cheng: Chinese Comedian, won 33% of a public vote on a shortlist of gags picked by comedy critics.
Previous winners include Tim Vine, Stewart Francis and Zoe Lyons.
Cheng told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was surprised the joke won the award because it had been a "groaner".
"Audiences tends to groan at it a lot," he said.
"I'm generally going after laughs, but I'll take the groan."
Cheng said he came up with the joke when the government announced plans for the new 12-sided Â£1 coin in 2014.
Asked to pick what joke he thought was the funniest besides his own, he said Frankie Boyle's.
Cheng studied maths at Cambridge for a year before dropping out to play online poker professionally.
His big break in showbiz came when he reached the final of the 2015 BBC Radio New Comedy Award.
On winning the Dave prize, Cheng said: "I am very proud to have won.
"As a tribute, I will name my firstborn son after this award and call him 'Joke of the Fringe'."

15. "I went to a Pretenders gig. It was a tribute act" - Tim Vine
The award, which was voted on by 2,000 people, lists jokes anonymously to avoid any bias towards well-known comedians.
Steve North, general manager of Dave, said: "From Trump and veganism to the new pound coin, this year's news agenda has certainly also provided some great inspiration for comedians to get grips with.
"It's fantastic to see that, even after ten years of the Joke of the Fringe award, there is no shortage of brilliant one-liners delivered at the Festival to get us all laughing."
Masai Graham won last year's award with the gag: "My dad suggested I register for a donor card. He's a man after my own heart."

article Their emotionally-charged, radio-friendly rock anthems like Radioactive and Sucker For Pain have won Grammy Awards, number one albums and a scarily loyal fanbase.
But behind closed doors, the band's frontman Dan Reynolds was struggling with severe depression.
Things came to a head on their last world tour. Playing 110 dates in 42 countries on five continents left the singer "numb".
"It came to a point where I didn't have an option," he tells the BBC. "It was lose my family and lose my life or seek help."
After the band's final concert of the tour in Amsterdam last February, the star told his bandmates he was taking a year off to tackle the condition, which has plagued him since childhood.
"When I was younger, in school, I would just let it pass, and ride out the valleys and the peaks and the ups and downs," he says.
"Then I tried medication and it was too scary for me, because I felt like it was going to change the music."
So last year, he "went to a therapist and sat down and basically faced it head on for the first time".
Having decided not to take antidepressants, his treatment took "a more holistic route" than before - changing his diet, cutting out sugar and practicing yoga and meditation.
The latter, in particular, "has been huge" for the singer, who says he has trouble "quieting" his brain.
Reynolds was supported through the last year by his wife, fellow musician Aja Volkman, and bandmate Wayne Sermon, whom he's known since childhood.
"We're brothers, so if he's not in a good place, then none of us are," says Sermon.
The guitarist admits everyone in the band has "demons that came out" after their ascent to fame - including his own issues with trust and "questioning people's motives".
"When you're under a microscope, it's going to magnify all the problems you had before," he says, "But I don't want to be to be down about it, because I feel like we've come out better people. All of us."
Those changes are the foundation of Imagine Dragons' new album Evolve.
The artwork shows a human form ascending from a place of eternal darkness to one of light and colour, while the music is inventive and vibrant - especially when compared to the claustrophobic onslaught of their last record.
"Smoke + Mirrors was super-angsty" admits Reynolds. "This album is a celebration of opening the blinds and the light shining through."
On the lead single, Believer, he writes about his personal transformation while acknowledging: "My life, my love, my drive, it came from pain."
"I was raised in a really conservative household and carried a heavy guilty conscience with me because of religion," he explains. "Letting go of that was really freeing and wonderful. But I've also learned to be happy for the things I learned from it and grateful for the love that I found.
"If it wasn't for all of those things working in the exact way they did, Imagine Dragons would cease to exist."
The seventh of nine children, Reynolds was raised in a strict Mormon household. Aged 19, he volunteered to become a missionary in Nebraska for two years, proselytizing for the church and helping drug addicts.
On his return, he enrolled to study music at the Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Utah, but dropped out to form Imagine Dragons with Sermon and two of his classmates from the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston.
In the beginning, they took any gig they could get, even opening for a mime at a nearby shopping centre. One regular booking at a local casino saw them playing six-hour sets three times a week, mixing original material with crowd-pleasing covers.
Their big break came in 2010 when roots rock band Train pulled out of a local festival. With just half an hour's notice, Imagine Dragons were promoted to the main stage and played for 26,000 people.
Within a year, they had signed to Interscope Records and started work on their debut album, Night Visions.
Like fellow Las Vegas rock band The Killers (who are managed by Reynolds' older brother, Robert), the group straddle the divide between rock and pop, embellishing their fist-pumping choruses with the sleek textures and throbbing rhythms of dance music.
It's no surprise, then, that they're one of the few rock acts to score commercial success at a time when pop and hip-hop dominate the charts.
"One of the reasons we called our band Imagine Dragons is so we had no boundaries," says Reynolds. "We created music that was all over the map because we didn't want people to expect power chords on my guitar or a simple pop song every time.
"We wanted the leash to be gone and for us to be able to run wild in the field."
The band's eager eclecticism has irritated purists ("pop deserves better, rock deserves better," sniffed one review) but it makes perfect sense in the streaming era, when fans flit between genres on a whim.
On Evolve, their sound has also become leaner - free from the sonic, as well as the emotional, baggage of their last record.
A song called Yesterday is particularly eye-opening, with Reynolds singing like a bluesman wandering through the dustbowl, over a gregarious piano stomp.
"We really reached into our roots of being inspired by the more eccentric songs from the Beatles and Queen," says Reynolds.
The band were propelled out of their comfort zone by recruiting an array of top-shelf producers, including Lorde's right-hand man Joel Little, and Swedish duo Mattman & Robin, who have worked for Britney Spears and Taylor Swift.
They even got some help from Justin Tranter, one of pop's most in-demand writers, whose credits include Justin Bieber's Sorry and DNCE's Cake by the Ocean.
"He understood my trepidation at working with another writer," says Reynolds.
"I've never done it before - but he knew that I had to write all my own lyrics and he was a wonderful sounding board, melodically."
The singer is excited for fans to hear the record ("it feels like Christmas is coming"), especially after the group's year-long hiatus.
"A lot of our fans really invest their life into this band," he says. "They come to every show, they get tattoos, their whole wall is lined in Imagine Dragons things.
"And I get it, because I was that kid, you know? That's what Nirvana was to me when I was a little kid. Kurt was everything to me.
"So I feel a responsibility to all of the people who invest their time into Imagine Dragons... an obligation to be honest and tell them what my heart says."
That's why he decided to write about his depression and to address it in interviews.
"I was really shy about speaking out," he says. "Humanity doesn't like to acknowledge their frailty. We like to only acknowledge our strengths. But I think it's important to talk about it."
"It's like the song Believer," adds Sermon. "Of course, every human wants to avoid pain at all cost - but the truth is, that's one time we really grow."
Imagine Dragons' third album, Evolve, is released on Friday 23 June.

article Mr Fisker's previous company, Fisker Automotive, founded in 2007, built luxury cars popular with celebrities until its high profile 2013 bankruptcy.
For his new venture, Mr Fisker has announced both a high-end car as well as an affordable mass-market model.
Carmakers worldwide are increasingly focusing on the electric market.
Reviving his rivalry with Tesla, Mr Fisker promised "a significantly longer battery life and range than any battery currently on the market".
"Both the technology and the market are more mature now than when we first started out as pioneers in the electric vehicle industry, and our new vehicle will be the most innovative and cutting-edge electric car ever created," he said.
Before starting his first electric car company in California, the Danish designer worked for car firms including Aston Martin and BMW.
The Fisker Karma model, released in 2012 for $100,000, attracted a lot of celebrity interest with buyers such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber.
But after selling around 2, 000 vehicles, Mr Fisker left the company and it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2013 owing US taxpayers $139m (Â£109m).
It later saw its assets sold to Chinese company Wanxiang.
Despite also having failed to ever make a profit, Tesla is preparing the launch of a new mass market model set to be priced lower than its flagship Model S and Model X cars.
Traditional carmakers like General Motors, Renault Nissan or Volkswagen are also moving into all-electric vehicles.

article It's a tiny claim on his greatness, the pleasure in being somehow part of his sporting story; a tale to tell the grandkids, the sharing in a communal homage to probably the greatest there has ever been.
With all Federer has done at Wimbledon, and the style with which he has done it, you can understand the reaction. What makes less logical sense is that the same does not happen to Serena Williams.
There is admiration, of course, and great respect for what she has achieved. But even after her 25th Grand Slam final, there does not seem to be the same desperation to have seen her powers in person. And that, by any reckoning, needs to be put right.
For Serena, arguably, is the most dominant single athlete in sport over the past 15 years.
On Saturday she beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win Wimbledon for the sixth time and complete the 'Serena Slam' of holding all four major titles.
In reaching 28 Grand Slam semi-finals she has lost just three. Of those 25 Slam finals, she has won five times as many as she has lost.
She is the oldest player, male or female, to ever be world number one; 16 years on from her first Slam triumph, aged just 17, she has won the first three of the year with her 34th birthday just eight weeks away.
To put that into context, there were 12 years between Martina Navratilova's first Grand Slam win and her last. It was the same for Steffi Graf. Margaret Court stretched her peak out to 13, yet she never won another beyond 31 years old.
Federer? He won his first Grand Slam event in 2003 and his last, thus far, in 2012 - a span six years shorter than Serena's. Born within a month of each other, in the last four-and-a-half years, Federer has won one Slam, Serena nine.
That Maria Sharapova has earned more money than Williams despite having been beaten 18 times in their 20 meetings is a sorry reflection both on the calculation of a sportswoman's commercial worth and our own appreciation of what makes a true champion.
"Serena has shown that you can be tough, you can be fearless, you can be courageous, you can be a competitor and you can still be a woman," says former world number one and three-time Grand Slam champion Lindsay Davenport, who spent much of her career battling Williams.
"She was the most intimidating opponent I ever faced. With some players you would be intimidated by their record or their game, like with Steffi Graf. But with Serena you were scared by absolutely everything - her passion, her attitude, how she serves, the power she has, her athleticism.
"She plays tennis at a different level. She is better than any player on tour even if she is only at 80% - and I think she would still win a ton of matches at just 50%."
There is the physical strength of Williams to admire: a serve not only of unprecedented speed but flawless technique, impervious to pressure or occasion. There are groundstrokes whose power gets all the headlines but with a depth and placement that is equally destructive.
Then there is the immense mental fortitude: the three Grand Slam singles titles won after being match point down; coming through the depression and loss of form in 2006 that saw her slip to 95 in the world, coming back from the pulmonary embolism in 2010 that could have ended her career.
Martina Hingis is only a year older and yet is reduced to playing occasional doubles, her body wrecked by injury and her love of the game sapped long ago. Justine Henin, a year younger, retired for the second time in 2011. Kim Clijsters, younger again, retired three years ago.
To keep going as Serena has is one miracle. To keep going at the very top is quite another.
"In the middle part of her career, when she went through a real lull, there was a lot for her to overcome," says Davenport, who was beaten by Serena in the final of the 2005 Australian Open.
"Somewhere along the line she was able to flip the switch and get more into how good she actually is. She started to buy into it, but it came at a much later age than it did for some of the other previous champions we've seen.
"During that period when she had eight to 14 Grand Slams she was in no-man's land. I know that sounds ridiculous, but she needed goals and the motivation to break records.
"Once she got past 14 Grand Slam titles, she was like, 'Wait a second here,  I'm getting closer to the mark of Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova of 18 and even closer to Steffi Graf's all-time record [in the Open Era].'
"In a weird way it helped too having Federer around, who is still so committed and was still winning Slams and not going anywhere. All of a sudden it became OK to want to compete in your 30s and be able to dominate."
Federer inspires devotion like few other players. It is impossible to imagine him behaving as Serena did in losing the US Open final in 2009 on a foot-fault and penalty point, telling a line judge that she would shove a ball in a place where it is not ordinarily found.
Federer is all control, at least until the point of victory, when ice breaks and the tears flow. Serena is at least three contradictory characters in one - the warrior player, the handbag-designing girlie girl, the insecure body-conscious woman.
She even has names for them: Summer, who is all smiles and thank-you notes; Psycho Serena, the on-court competitor, and then Taquanda, the US Open one, the one you really wouldn't want to be around, tennis ball to hand or not.
Pretentious? Hard to warm to? This is a woman so lacking confidence that she refuses to lift weights because she is worried about making her arms look too big (she uses resistance bands instead), who grew up in the shadow of a more successful elder sister and then had to learn to beat her, who grew up in an area where no-one had ever gone where she was aiming.
"I was never the one that was supposed to be good," she has said of her relationship with Venus, "but I was determined not to be a statistic."
It is the complexity of Serena's character, the thing that seems to put distance between her and some fans, that should instead underscore her achievements.
So perfectionist is she about her tennis that she refuses to play a game in practice in case she loses, and instead insists on playing a succession of unrelated points.
"It's hard and lonely at the top," she has said. "Everyone wants to beat you. Everyone talks behind your back. God forbid I lose. It's like, 'Why?' Well, I am human."
There are any number of reasons she could have escaped all that. She has won enough, earned enough, proved herself superior to Venus and all those other great rivals who have come and now gone.
And yet she keeps going, keeps winning, keeps driving.
"It's remarkable what she has been able to achieve in the last three to four years," says Davenport, at Wimbledon as an analyst for BBC Sport.
"You have to give a lot of credit to her coach Patrick Mouratoglou. She was exclusively coached by her parents for so long and wasn't sure that she would ever respect or understand another person's voice, but she let somebody else in and he has got through to her.
"Who knows why? Who knows how? Nobody knows the intricacies of their relationship, but he has got her to believe in herself and to buy into the mantra of, 'You are the greatest player, but you've got to still prove it'.
"Their record is amazing. You can't deny that he has got her to completely invest herself emotionally in just about every tournament she enters. He channels her in the right direction."
That dominance. Take it outside tennis, and who can match her? Tiger Woods won his first major in 1997 and his last in 2008. Cristiano Ronaldo was a 14-year-old kid in Madeira when Serena began her reign, Leo Messi a frail 12-year-old boy.
Kobe Bryant has five NBA rings, but perhaps only Floyd Mayweather, 48 fights unbeaten since his professional debut in 1996, can truly compare. And that is against underdogs and outsiders as well as true contenders. To remain the best, Serena has had to repeatedly beat the best. No easy match-ups, no easy years, no easy titles.
Tough. Fearless. Courageous. A competitor, and still a woman. That is Serena, and that is why we should celebrate her, even as she appears unstoppable, even as she appears forever.

article Albion Rovers won 2-1 in the North Lanarkshire derby, while Peterhead won 1-0 at Glebe Park to leave Stranraer second bottom of the table.
The Diamonds had given a debut to 20-year-old Scottish striker Jack McKay, who signed on loan from Leeds United.
But it was on-loan Hamilton Accies striker Steven Boyd whose brace won it.
Saturday's defeat of Livingston by East Fife had presented Airdrieonians and Brechin with an opportunity to narrow the gap at the top.
The 19-year-old Boyd fired the opener after 15 minutes at Excelsior Stadium, but Adam Brown's drive from outside the penalty box drew the sides level nine minutes later.
Boyd struck again in similar fashion, with Scott McBride again the creator, seconds before the break for his sixth goal of the season and Rovers held on for the win despite intense Diamonds pressure.
Rory McAllister's 13th goal of the season gave Peterhead a deserved win, heading into the top corner after 77 minutes of a game in which Brechin only managed one attempt on target.
Peterhead's first win in six games means Brechin remain a point behind Airdrieonians in third, with the Diamonds seven adrift of Livingston.
Jim McInally's side leapfrog Stranraer, who are now two points behind, with Albion remaining two points ahead of the north east side.
Meanwhile, Stranraer have signed 22-year-old Partick Thistle midfielder David Wilson on loan.

article Researchers there are using artificial intelligence to create robots that will learn from their environment, each other - and us.
The ECR is a joint initiative between Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh.
Its new Robotarium will open later this year thanks to Â£8m of support from the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).
Now the EPSRC is giving almost Â£1m more to develop four new robots that will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform healthcare and emergency response.
It comes as the centre prepares to host the European Robotics Forum later this week.
Prof Oliver Lemon of Heriot-Watt's computer science department says they are experiencing a great leap forward.
"There have been some really big advances recently in AI, in particular in computer vision and in human language processing," he says.
"It's to do with new machine learning methods that have been developed quite recently - and also much, much faster machines.
"So we're at a point now where these machine learning methods can be integrated with robot platforms."
Even though she is a machine, it is difficult not to think of Pepper as female.
She/he/it stands about 4ft (1m) tall and has a humanoid body, big eyes on a face designed to appeal to humans, and a dancer's hips.
She can indeed dance but that is not her primary function.
Pepper has been funded by the EU in a project to create a socially-intelligent robot.
Before long it will be deployed in a shopping mall in Finland to help people - and people will help Pepper.
Because after the formal programming is complete, Pepper will continue to learn from us.
She is a harbinger of much bigger things.
The ECR is developing robots that can think for themselves - and learn.
This new era of better interaction between humans and robots means involving not just computing and engineering but the social sciences too, according to Dr Katrin Lohan, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt.
"We are interested in how to develop robots that are programmable by everyone, so that they can learn from us in natural interaction rather than us just sitting there and typing in code," she says.
Robots have long been able to do our dirty work, from sweeping hospital floors to building cars. The addition of artificial intelligence is bringing in researchers from across the disciplines.
Dr Thusha Rajendran, associate professor of psychology at Heriot-Watt's School of Social Sciences, is developing a robot buddy to help adults with autism "read" their work mates' faces.
"Trying to know whether somebody is annoyed with you or pleased with you is difficult even for us," he says.
"What the robot allows you to do is isolate different areas of the face and specifically look at face recognition in a much more fine-grained way, rather than looking at people.
"The robot will have a much more readable face which will then translate for the person with autism into 'what does this person think of me?'".
Prof Lemon has another example of how robots can transform healthcare: spotting skin tumours.
A doctor may have experience of seeing a few hundred at the most.
By feeding a robot images of tumours, it can have "seen" thousands, perhaps millions more than any specialist ever could.
That will not put specialists out of work but it will lead to speedier and more accurate diagnoses.
Across the capital at the University of Edinburgh, a robot called Husky is being trained to go into the sorts of hazardous places we can't.
Husky's chunky frame - moving on four wheels and supporting two powerful but sensitive manipulator arms - was built in Canada.
Superficially it looks a lot like the kind of robots we've been familiar with for years, the kind that handle radioactive material or deal with suspect devices.
But Husky has come here to learn.
Humans are setting out the big parameters and after that Husky is expected to think for itself.
That means it can improvise on the spot even if its controller is out of range.
Another student here is Valkyrie - a huge, humanoid Nasa robot which may one day walk on another world. But not before it's learned much more in Scotland.
Valkyrie can already walk, and is learning to walk better. That experience is feeding into another device: a robotic exoskeleton that will allow people with disabilities to walk again.
All these advances have the same underlying principle: autonomous robots with the ability to teach themselves to operate better.
For Edinburgh University's professor of robotics Sethu Vijayakumar we are at the beginning of a process which will transform how we live and work over the next two decades.
"All of this confluence of robotics, AI, social network systems and knowledge sharing is driving a huge, new revolution," he says.
"We have to invest in that here in the UK, in Scotland, in Edinburgh because if we don't do it here somebody else will do it and we'll be playing catch up."
First came the Internet, then the Internet of Things. You can think of this research as giving those things arms and legs.

article Mr Justice Nicol said the Home Office's system to "fast track" certain cases contained "structural unfairness".
The process accelerates legal hearings and appeals, while keeping the individual detained at all times.
The government said it was disappointed by the judgment and would be appealing.
The judge said that despite a number of safeguards, applicants were not able to properly prepare their cases and their lawyers were also put in an unfair position.
Ruling on a case brought by campaign group Detention Action, the judge said: "In my judgment the Fast Track Rules (FTR) do incorporate structural unfairness. They put the appellant at a serious procedural disadvantage.
"The appellant is always detained and, as is obvious, the fact of detention places additional obstacles in the way of achieving all that has to be done before a tribunal hearing.
Fast-track removals were introduced more than a decade ago because the then government believed too many people were abusing the system.
But critics have long said the speed of the procedure is manifestly unfair, not least to individuals who may have complex but genuine claims for protection.
Mr Justice Nicol has put a stay on his judgement, and that means that the fast-track system remains in operation and asylum seekers within it can still be removed.
But if the government loses the eventual appeal, it could deal a major blow to an important part of the removal system.
There have been previous judgements against parts of the system - but this one is more important because the court said it was wrong that ministers could impose time limits, rather than giving discretion to tribunals. That's something which the judge said looked like sacrificing fairness "on the altar of speed and convenience".
"What seems to me to make the FTR structurally unfair is the serious procedural disadvantage which comes from the abbreviated timetable and curtailed case management powers."
During the case, the government had argued that the system was fair because asylum seekers could ask for a 10-day adjournment before a final decision.
But the judge said the power to adjourn had a "very limited role" in ensuring a just outcome.
"Therefore I find that the claimant's challenge to the legality of the Fast Track Rules succeeds," the judge concluded.
Although Mr Justice Nicol has ruled the system illegal, he has put a temporary delay on his judgement coming into force to allow the government time to consider an appeal.
The Detained Fast Track system plays a key role in immigration removals and can lead to someone leaving the country in about 22 days.
The system was created in 2003, and was applied to 4,300 asylum seekers in 2013.
Reacting to the judgement, Detention Action director Jerome Phelps said: "We are pleased that the Fast Track appeals process has been found not just unlawful but ultra vires [beyond the government's powers].
"But we are shocked and disappointed that a stay has been granted, given that this is an area of law requiring the highest standards of justice and fairness.
"By granting the stay, it appears that the judge considers that the severe potential consequences to asylum seekers, including removal in breach of the Refugee Convention, are outweighed by the inconvenience to the Home Office and Lord Chancellor of suspending the process."
The Refugee Council welcomed the ruling, with chief executive Maurice Wren saying: "Today the courts have recognised the detained fast track appeals system for what it is: fundamentally unfair and a grotesque caricature of British justice.
"This is an important step forward in the battle to stop government officials arbitrarily and shamefully imprisoning some of the world's most desperate people who have simply asked for our protection."
The government says Detained Fast Track is an important part of the UK's immigration system.
A spokesman said: "It contributes significantly to the speed and effectiveness with which asylum cases are processed - including swiftly removing those found not to be in need of protection - and saves the taxpayer money."

article Leeds mosque leader Qari Asim said victims had been spat at or physically attacked but it went unreported because of a lack of confidence in police.
The Muslim Community Safety Forum said police figures did not give a true reflection of the current situation.
West, South and North Yorkshire Police urged people to report hate incidents.
Data supplied to the BBC showed that over the last year, race hate crimes had gone up 13% in Yorkshire.
However, the data also showed that there was no strong link between the EU referendum vote and a rise in the number of racially motivated hate crimes being recorded.
For example, in June 2016, 472 race hate crimes were dealt with by forces in North, South and West Yorkshire - the same number as in March 2016, three months before the referendum was held.
Wakefield councillor Nadeem Ahmed said he had been subjected to racist comments whilst out with his family.
Mr Ahmed, leader of the Conservative group, said for every incident flagged up to police many more went unreported and has urged victims to take a stand.
He said: "If I would have been on my own I wouldn't have been that angry, but my wife and children were in the car - they didn't need to hear that sort of language."
The claims comes as a new report published by the Muslim Community Safety Forum said there needed to be better awareness of how victims can report a hate crime.
Dr Asim, Imam of Leeds Makkah Mosque, said people needed to work together to create a more stable neighbourhood.
He said: "People have voted to leave Europe because they think it's going to make their life better, economically, politically and socially.
"If that doesn't happen in six months' time, I fear there are going to be worse crimes and hate crimes committed against European and South Asian communities."
Angela Williams, Assistant Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, said: "We have had a slight increase in incidents reported to us, but only really small increases.
"We believe that they are not being reported through to us, which is the issue. We're trying to raise awareness for people to come forward."

Meanwhile, on Thursday the bank also revealed that its 2014 profits fell by almost a third to €989m ($1.1bn; £730m) from €1.44bn.
It said net profits declined as a result of lower income in the current low-interest-rates environment, as well as due to higher operating expenses after it became the eurozone banking supervisor late last year.

The 28-year-old, from Nottinghamshire, has been targeted by trolls before, following the death of her father.
Facebook said it was investigating and had closed a fake profile that had been used to contact her.
Ms Sheeran - a YouTube vlogger whose TalkBeckyTalk channel has more than 150,000 subscribers - said she received a friend request from an account pretending to be her grandmother, Nina Sheeran, on Sunday.
The profile also added her sister, a number of other relatives and friends of her grandmother, who died in January.
Before her death, the pensioner used Facebook frequently.
A Facebook spokesman said a fake profile that had been contacting Ms Sheeran had been removed.
"It brings all these emotions up of somebody that's not here any more," Ms Sheeran said.
"You always wish you could see that person again and to suddenly see their name again... it's really distressing."
She said she reported the account to Facebook and wanted the person behind it to be "brought to justice".
She added: "It's good to suspend an account but it's not teaching someone a lesson - no-one has been held accountable."
Nottinghamshire Police said the case was a matter for Facebook.

article Chris Devonside died aged 18 after a crush at the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989, which led to the deaths of 96 Liverpool football fans.
He believed the condition of most football grounds was unacceptably poor, the coroner in Warrington heard.
Hillsborough campaigner Barry Devonside said the Heysel disaster was a warning.
Profiles of all those who died
Mr Devonside Jr, from Wirral, "argued passionately" that "greater transparency and honesty" was needed after the 1985 disaster, where 39 football fans, mostly Italians, died in a European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus.
Mr Devonside Sr said: "He believed that the condition of those football grounds he had visited was unacceptably poor.
"[Chris] argued passionately that the circumstances surrounding the Heysel Stadium disaster warranted greater transparency and honesty on the part of officialdom."
The former Hillsborough Family Support Group secretary added: "His life was ended abruptly, prematurely and unnecessarily because of the failures of others preventing Chris from fulfilling his dreams of travel and university."
Coroner Lord Justice Goldring has described the Hillsborough disaster as "the worst ever at a British sports stadium".
It unfolded on 15 April 1989 during Liverpool's match against Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's ground.
The coroner heard about Martin Wild, 29, from Cheshire, who attended the match with a friend who survived.
A statement from Mr Wild's father Kenneth - dated 25 April 1989 - was read out. His family did not respond to the coroner's request for background information.
It said: "Martin was a life-long Liverpool supporter and went to all the home games at Anfield.
"He rarely travelled to away games."
Mr Wild and his younger brother Nigel lived with his paternal grandmother, Anne Wild.
The mother of Anthony Kelly, 29, from Birkenhead, Wirral said the disaster "should never have happened".
Betty Almond said her son was a "sickly baby" and weighed 2lbs (900g) when he was born but became a "grand lad".
She said: "I miss him so much. Anthony was our only child.
"Hillsborough should never have happened."
The inquest jury was told about Paul Clark, 18, from Swanwick in Derbyshire who was "happy" and had a "bright future ahead of him".
His father Ken Clark said: "Paul was a popular young man who had many friends.
"To this day they all meet together in the village on the 15 April to remember him and lay flowers on his grave."
Paul Carlile, 19, from Liverpool, was "not a hooligan" and was "not a drunkard" but was "brought up to be a law-abiding citizen", the inquest heard.
In a statement, his mother Sandra Stringer said: "People say time heals. It doesn't."
The document, read by his sister, Donna Miller, added: "We haven't had time to heal. We just want some answers - that may give us some peace.
"He went to watch the team he loved and came home in a coffin."
The mother of Jonathon Owens, 18, from Chester, said she was "glad" of the memories he gave her family.
Pat Owens said: "I'm glad we were able to give him fond memories, just as he gave them to us.
"Our home life was great. It wasn't all a bed of roses but love and laughter was at the forefront.
"The three of us were the best of pals," she added.
The inquest jury heard a tribute to father-of-four Stephen Harrison, 31, from Liverpool, died who along with his brother Gary, 27.
His widow Susan Harrison described how: "Stephen was my rock, my soulmate and for our four children he was their world.
"The day Stephen left our lives our world fell apart, not just as a family but as individuals."
A statement from his mother Anne Wright said: "My two boys were good sons, brothers and fathers."
Sheffield University student Joseph Daniel McCarthy, 21, from London, was "one of life's good guys", the coroner was told.
His cousin Anthony Goggins said he excelled both academically and at sports.
Mr Goggins said: "Joe was one of life's good guys. He was genuinely a lovely human being, full of joy with a zest for life."
Jurors have been listening to brief background statements about how the Hillsborough disaster affected individual families.
The inquests, set to last a year, were ordered after new evidence revealed by the Hillsborough Independent Panel led to the original inquest verdicts being quashed.
The hearing was adjourned until Friday.

The complaint is being investigated. The constables are missing, he added.
Sexual violence in India has been in the spotlight since a student was gang-raped on a bus in Delhi two years ago.
The 23-year-old died days later in hospital from injuries sustained during the brutal assault, prompting global outrage.
The outcry forced India to introduce tough new rape laws, including the death penalty in particularly brutal cases.
But correspondents say the new laws have failed to prove a deterrent and reports of rapes and cases of assault on women have, in fact, gone up.
Last month, a 26-year-old Delhi woman accused a taxi driver using the web-based booking firm Uber of raping her.
The latest incident was reported from Musajhag area in Badaun - the same district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh where two teenage girls were found hanged last summer.
It was initially reported that the girls had been gang-raped and hanged, but federal investigators later said the teenagers "took their own lives".

article Chinese firm Baili sought a ban last year saying the iPhone infringed on the design of its 100C smartphone.
China's patent regulator agreed with Baili and imposed the ban on Apple and local reseller Zoomflight.
The Chinese court that overturned the ban said the regulator did not follow proper procedure when it was imposed.
Sales of the Apple phones were allowed to continue while the court case and appeal were being heard.
The Beijing Intellectual Property Court said the patent body had not given enough evidence to prove that a patented design was being violated.
The court said the iPhone 6 models did not infringe on the design and patents owned by Baili as people could easily distinguish between the 100c and the Apple models.
It did deny Apple's application to have Baili stripped of the patent at the centre of the case.
Sales of Apple phones in China have come under pressure recently thanks to strong local competition from Huawei, Xiaomi and newer firms such as Oppo and Vivo. Last year, Apple sales in Greater China, which covers China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, were down 33%.
Beijing's Intellectual Property Office and Baili said they were considering whether to appeal against the court's decision.

article Inside the wood-panelled sanctuary of a small, North Philadelphia church, a group of men - and one woman - are busily folding handouts and talking strategy.
"I'm gonna be the one they attack," says Bruce Carter, gesturing to his T-shirt which says TRUMP in large red lettering. "They're comin' for me."
Calvin Tucker, a tall, nattily dressed Trump surrogate in a coat, tie and Make America Great Again cap, acts the moment.
"'Wow - you're supporting Trump?' â€¦ 'Man, what are you doing?'" he says, then answers himself: "Hey - we gotta try something different."
Parked just outside of First Immanuel Baptist Church in North Philadelphia is a line of vans and SUVs wrapped in various slogans, like "Black Republicans for Urban Communities", and "Famous Black Republicans" over photos of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.
Then there's the lead van, plastered with pictures of the billionaire candidate's face.
"TRUMP for Urban Communities," it proclaims.
In neighbourhoods that vote overwhelmingly Democratic, in a city that hasn't had a Republican mayor since 1952, the vehicles are sure to draw plenty of attention, especially since there are pockets of these predominantly African American communities where Mitt Romney did not receive a single vote in 2012.
"It's real simple," says Carter, the founder of Trump for Urban Communities. "Your district has some of the deepest poverty in America and you've only voted for the Democrat. So it's reasonable for you to try something different."
This has been Trump's pitch to black voters as well: "You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?" He's called the inner cities of America war zones, and blamed Democrats - who often hold local power - for the cities' decline.
Trump's 58% youth unemployment figure is inflated and critics says his characterisation of black life in America as "hell" is out of touch with reality. But the predominantly African-American neighbourhoods in North Philadelphia do have the highest rates of violent crime in the city. The streets are lined with empty homes and businesses. A 2012 estimate for unemployment among high school drop outs in the area came close to Trump's figure: 50%.
While the message has not resonated with most black voters - various polling around the country shows Trump's African-American support somewhere between 0% and 4% - Tucker heard it loud and clear. A lifelong Republican, Tucker was Trump's lone black delegate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.
As a loan officer and financial services contractor, Tucker loves what he sees as Trump's business acumen.
Back in September, Tucker moderated a panel discussion with Trump and black Philadelphian business owners as anti-Trump protesters demonstrated outside. At the time, Tucker thanked Trump for "being brave enough to come" to the neighbourhood.
"Typically, Republicans don't travel in the heart of the underserved communities and talk about issues," he says. "He's also talked about the solution, and the solutions are jobs and employment and opportunity and entrepreneurship - those are the kinds of things that our community needs to eradicate poverty and unemployment and reduce crime."
Ten minutes further north, the head of the Philadelphia GOP is leading a poll-watching training in the dim offices of an anti-violence non-profit called the Urban Crisis Response Center, which also houses a headquarters for the Trump campaign.
"I don't think we could have opened a Romney office [here]," says Joe DeFelice, Philadelphia's Republican Party chairman. He says black voters don't identify Trump as a Republican so much as his own brand of politician.
"Do I think he's going to win this neighbourhood we're standing in? No, I'm not naÃ¯ve. I get it. Do I think he's going to do a hell of a lot better than Romney did? One-hundred percent."
Daphne Goggins, a North Philadelphia native and lifelong Republican, is in a bright orange "Hillary for Prison" T-shirt, handing out poll-watching packets  The tiny former barbershop is filled with both the politically engaged as well as people with no love for Trump, just eager for the $100 pay.
"Donald Trump is already creating jobs in the black community," she points out.
Goggins resents the way that Democrats in Philadelphia have always been able to rely on the black vote, despite the fact she says most people she talks to don't even know why they vote the way they do. She is a social conservative - pro-life and against gay marriage - and wants lower taxes. Many black Democrats she speaks to agree with her.
"You're a Republican," she informs them.
"We have a violence problem - the Democrats [have done] nothing to really address these murders," she says. "There's no legislation, there should be a curfew, something - we're losing our babies just like in Chicago.
"Black children are just doomed to die and that's OK with America."
Back outside the church, the Trump for Urban Communities group doesn't even make it into their vehicles before the fireworks begin.
"You've got to be kidding me," one woman snarls, brushing past the men and refusing to talk.
"Trump is evil, Trump do not care about us," a young woman in a denim jacket calls out. "He is ignorant!"
Two women in a passing car flip the Trump van off, then drive away as Carter knocks on the windows calling, "Sister! Sister!"
In a nail salon with a Clinton-Kaine sign in the window, the group finds a captive audience - women with their hands under heat lamps.
"Dallas, where I'm from, we're number two in poverty in the black community - it looks similar to this," Carter tells the sceptical salon customers. "I know he understands economic development and I know he understands business - that's why I support him."
"Where were you guys the rest of the year?" a young woman with her feet in a bubbling bath chimes in.
Tucker turns to her.
"This is hard work getting folks to listen to a different philosophy," he says. "You've heard all this Hillary Clinton stuff - what are they going to do for your community? That's why we gotta bring young people like you into this process, that think differently, that's going to ask the hard questions."
Carter pays for one of the women's manicures and they leave, to a chorus of anti-Trump shouts from a man across the street. Standing outside, Tucker says he knows no one in the shop will likely vote any differently.
"I'm not necessarily here to convert, I'm just here to educate," he says. "When you are 95% in one party, Democrats take you for granted. When you're 2% Republican, they say, 'You don't make a difference, therefore why should we provide opportunities for your community?'
In front of the Trump van, Carter looks around at the blighted buildings, the mattresses and smashed TV sets laying in a vacant lot - he catches a whiff of what smells like raw sewage seeping out of an abandoned building.
"There's no way you can walk through these communities and not get mad," he says. "Yes, the Republican party has failed the black community because they have given up on them. But Democrats - they failed them far worse. The blacks belong to them, but they get nothing for it. It's political slavery."

article The discharges are in breach of approvals but are said to be well within the overall site safety limit.
According to the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), the gaseous tritium is from an authorised outlet but is greater than it should be.
The Chapelcross site ceased power generation in 2004.
Sepa staff have been to the facility a number of times to discuss the issue with the operators.
They say that while a sub-limit for gaseous disposals has been exceeded, it is a small fraction of the authorised disposal limit for the whole site.
On that basis, Sepa says it is confident there is no risk to the public or the environment, although investigations are continuing to find the reason for the increase.
Tritium - a radioactive isotope of hydrogen - was a by-product of the nuclear operations at Chapelcross and was used in the weapons industry.
Gaseous tritium is sometimes used for its radio-luminescence by makers of self-illuminating watches or signposts.

article Neath MP Christina Rees's bill would give mothers of the bride and groom parity with their fathers.
Currently, in Wales and England, only the father's name is legally required.
Ms Rees said it was time to modernise marriage. The bill stands little chance of becoming law without government support, but she said cross-party support could lead to change.
"It's nearing the end of 2015 and, despite a few previous attempts to rectify this, we are still following this archaic tradition," she said.
"The recognition of women in society is improving day-by-day, and this next step will be seen as a milestone for equality."

article People come here to chase dreams. Some come to sing in the hope of emulating those whose faces adorn the enormous billboards.
Some come to build business, to add to the brash and brightly lit skyline which already boasts a replica pyramid and Eiffel Tower.
Some simply come to gamble, to sit in the city's myriad casinos, hoping to stumble upon the win which might just set them up for life.
Others come to fight. One of those is Lee Selby.
The Welshman is here to defend his IBF featherweight world title against Jonathan Victor Barros, on the undercard of WBA champion Carl Frampton's much-vaunted rematch with Leo Santa Cruz.
Selby is also here to triumph in style - hoping to secure a fight with the winner of Frampton-Santa Cruz - and to impress in a city boxing calls one of its spiritual homes.
Media playback is not supported on this device
"The dream for every fighter is to one day box for a world title in Las Vegas, and for most it's not a realistic dream," Selby says.
"For myself it wasn't, but I go to show with hard work, with that dream, focus and dedication, you can make it possible.
"That's not just in boxing or sport, that's in anything you do in life."
Selby finds himself in a quintessentially Las Vegan setting, sat by the sparsely populated, palm tree-laden swimming pools at the MGM Grand hotel, where he fights Barros on Saturday.
It is a crisp January afternoon, sunshine reflecting on Selby's personalised baseball cap as the softly spoken 29-year-old from Barry coolly considers the task ahead.
This is a city of decadence, where every room seems to be a casino and the absence of windows and clocks often renders the concept of time redundant.
One can feel lost in this alternate reality, but Selby, teetotal and a devoted trainer regardless of his fight schedule, is oblivious to Las Vegas' many distractions.
"I'm here on a strictly business trip. I haven't been sightseeing. I've been to Las Vegas many times training so I've seen everything it's got to offer," he adds.
"I've been out here, been in all the gyms, been in the arena, so it's not too new.
"I'm here just to get on with the job. We had nine nights in Los Angeles [for a training camp] before we came here, so we're acclimatised and ready to put on a show."
American boxing crowds can be difficult to please and, having fought on this side of the Atlantic before, Selby knows he will have to be at his fluent best to entertain those inside the MGM Grand.
He is particularly eager to do so because of his desire to fight the winner of the headline bout between Frampton and Santa Cruz, the next step in his ultimate goal of unifying a fiercely competitive featherweight division.
Yet it might be difficult to cut loose against Barros, a seasoned Argentine who has won 41 of his 46 fights in a professional career spanning almost 13 years.
"He's knocked out more opponents than I've had fights," Selby says.
"To be honest, I'm not sure what his approach is going to be.
"In some fights of his I've watched, he's boxed on the back foot behind the jab and in other fights he's tucked up and taken the fight to his opponents.
"It will be more entertaining if he forces the fight but usually pressure fighters, you'll see what I've done to them in the past - they suit me down to a tee and I can box on the back foot and out-box them.
"So I'm not sure what to expect but, whatever he comes out with, I've got the ability to adapt in the ring and get the win by any means possible.
"The main thing is to win. The American fans like to see a tear-up.
"I've seen two quality, classy boxers here and the whole crowd has booed them, so I might have to do some fighting."
If Selby needs to scrap with Barros, he will do so. He will have to be versatile if his dream fight with Frampton is to materialise.
Media playback is not supported on this device
If Selby needs to fight Barros tactically and pragmatically, he will do so too. The Welshman will take whatever action he deems necessary to win.
He would like to do so with a flourish, to defend his title for a third time in a manner convincing enough to enhance his burgeoning reputation in America.
What he cannot consider is defeat.
"I treat every fight the same. Even my first fight was like a world title fight," he says.
"I've got to win. The fear of losing is too much. I don't want to have regrets."

article The presenter, who first rose to prominence as a contestant on The Apprentice in 2007, joined LBC last April.
Hopkins is known for her controversial opinions and regularly attracts criticism for her views.
She has continued tweeting since LBC's announcement but has not yet referred to her own departure.
Hopkins is also a Mail Online columnist and appeared in Celebrity Big Brother in 2015, finishing in second place.
Both LBC and Hopkins declined to comment further when contacted by the BBC.
Her two-hour programme was broadcast every Sunday morning and saw her review the week's news and take calls from listeners.
This week, she caused anger with when she tweeted that there must be a "final solution" in dealing with terrorists following the Manchester terror attack.
Some followers questioned her use of the phrase "final solution" - a term used by the Nazis to refer to the Holocaust - but later Hopkins altered it to "true solution", describing the earlier version as a "mis-type".
But some Twitter users drew the comments to the attention of the Metropolitan Police, claiming they could incite racial or religious hatred.
The Metropolitan Police confirmed the matter was being "reviewed and assessed by specialist officers".
After Hopkins made the comments, another LBC presenter, James O'Brien, described on air the "shame" he felt about sharing a platform with her.
He called Hopkins "a monstrous self-publicist" who "employs the most vile of thoughts and language in a desperate attempt to stay relevant and get noticed".
Earlier this year, food writer Jack Monroe won Â£24,000 in damages, plus Â£107,000 in legal costs, in a libel action against Hopkins after a row over two tweets, which Monroe said caused "serious harm" to her reputation.
Hopkins was later told she could not appeal against the ruling.
In December, she apologised to a Muslim family she accused of being extremists after they were refused entry to the US for a Disneyland trip.
Mail Online, which published her claim, also paid Â£150,000 in libel damages to the Mahmood family.
Hopkins has gradually built up her reputation as a controversial figure since 2013, when she appeared on This Morning during a discussion about children's names.
Last year, she cut her hair short, explaining that she was not allowed to wash it immediately following successful brain surgery to treat her epilepsy.
In 2014, she told The Guardian that as a result of the condition her arms would dislocate during fits and she would have to go into hospital to have them relocated. "I'm hard with myself. Get on with it. Move on. Get your arms put back in," she said.

article The Transportation Safety Board confirmed that at 07:30 EST (12:30 GMT), a Porter Airlines flight from Ottawa to Toronto nearly collided with what they believe was a drone.
Two crew members received minor injuries during the manoeuvre.
Investigators at Billy Bishop Airport are looking into the incident.
The flight was at an altitude of approximately 9,000ft (2,740m) over Lake Ontario and making its initial approach for landing at Toronto's island airport on Monday when the pilots noticed an object in the distance.
As they got closer the pilots realised the object, which they first believed was a balloon, was very close to the flight path. They decided to take evasive action.
Porter is working with the Transportation Safety Board investigators, according to a statement.
The injured flight attendants were taken to hospital and have since been released. The 54 passengers on the flight were unharmed.
Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Authority in the US both have "No Drone Zone" safety campaigns meant to highlight the dangers of flying drones near airports and other areas that could put aviation safety at risk.

article The 26-year-old number eight suffered his latest injury in Bath's 40-26 defeat by Wasps on Christmas Eve.
Wales start their Six Nations campaign in Italy on Sunday, 5 February
"He is progressing well and back running," said McBryde. "It's a bit too early to say 'yay' or 'nay' for Italy."
Faletau was sidelined for over two months with damage to the same ligaments earlier this season.
McBryde added: "We have a good relationship with the Bath physios and it's going in the right way and progressing well - everything is going in the right direction.
"It has been well documented and everyone knows his strengths, he's world class."
Bath have an Anglo-Welsh Cup game against Gloucester on Friday night, but McBryde appeared to rule Faletau out of that fixture.
"Not this weekend, that would be rushing things," said McBryde.
"We want to see how things go this week and next week make that decision closer to the time.
"Ideally it would be great to give him some game time before the following week."
Faletau has played in only four games for Bath, having joined from Newport Gwent Dragons this season.
And the 2013 Lions Test player missed three of Wales' four autumn internationals in November 2016.
He played in the 27-13 win over South Africa on 26 November, creating a try for Justin Tipuric as Wales beat the Springboks for only the third time.
Meanwhile, Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb captained Ospreys in their Challenge Cup victory over Newcastle on Saturday, his first match since suffering an ankle injury against Australia last November.
Wales have the option of asking Webb to play for Ospreys in the Challenge Cup match against Bristol in Bridgend on Saturday.

Police said he and friends were in a confrontation with another group.
A man, 19, has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and both failing to stop and report a collision.
Officers said  four people the victim had been arguing with left in two cars but no-one in the vehicles stopped.
He is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
Greater Manchester Police is now investigating the circumstances leading up to the crash, including allegations of racist remarks made during the argument.  Officers are also analysing CCTV images.
A spokesman for the force said they "were certainly investigating the possibility" that the car was deliberately driven at the victim.

article The Boeing 777 disappeared while flying to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board in March 2014.
Malaysia, China and Australia are searching a large area of the Southern Ocean, where the plane is believed to have gone down.
But without new evidence the search will be suspended later this year.
Grace Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on board the plane, said the relatives "just want to know what efforts are being made so new credible information can be found for the search to go on".
She said the inconclusive investigation had made it difficult to find closure.
"I really have mixed emotions about the whole trip," Ms Nathan told Australia's ABC radio.
"I live in denial about what's happened."
Some relatives have also accused Malaysian authorities of ignoring possible new evidence washing up along the African coast.
Three pieces of aircraft debris were retrieved last month in the waters off Mozambique.
The largest piece of debris, a triangular piece of metal, red and white on one side - the colours of Malaysia Airlines - was discovered by a South African hotelier.
The debris will be sent to Malaysia for examination.
Many relatives of those on board MH370 tell me they are frustrated at the way the search is being handled.
They fear that hundreds, maybe thousands of plane parts and personal belongings are sitting, untouched, on remote beaches across the Indian ocean.
Yet there's no plan to go and find them.
They argue that locals in these hard-to-reach areas, fishermen for example, could be mobilised to look for clues. All you'd have to do is get the word out, advise them what to search for and what to do if they find anything.
As things stand just one man, an unpaid American enthusiast called Blaine Gibson, is combing beaches for debris.
It's unlikely that small parts will reveal the fate of the flight, but they may offer clues. And as the giant sea search is wound down later this year, the families tell me that looking on beaches may be the only way to get answers and recover precious belongings from the people they love.
Their biggest fear is that the search will be dropped, the world will move on, and they'll be left in limbo wondering what happened.

One man's search for answers
MH370 'must not go into oblivion'
Eight next of kin from several countries arrived in Perth on Tuesday, on a self-funded trip.
They will meet representatives of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and will be shown a small fragment of recovered wreckage.
The ATSB is co-ordinating the ocean search but Malaysia is responsible for recovering any debris which washes up elsewhere.
A report by the Australian newspaper earlier this week suggested the relatives may lobby the Australian government to take over the investigation from Malaysia.
Ms Nathan said the families had been frustrated by what they perceive to be the indifference of Malaysian authorities.
"They never want to speak to us. The Malaysian mainstream media have been told to stay away from us," she said.
The relatives also hope to clarify whether recent discoveries of debris on the African coast counts as credible new evidence, and whether the A$170m (Â£97m; $130m) search could be continued in a more cost effective way.
More than 110,000 sq km (68,000 sq miles) of sea floor have been searched so far. The full 120,000 sq km search is expected to be completed by around December.
But one of the Chinese ships has spent more time more time anchored off Western Australia than searching at sea.
The Don Hai Jiu has lost its sonar imaging "tow fish" and suffered an injured crewman since it got involved in the search six months ago.
The vessel has had its tow fish in the water for fewer than 30 days, say Australia officials.
Where some of the confirmed or suspected MH370 debris was found
1. A section of wing called a flaperon, found on Reunion Island in July 2015 - confirmed as debris in September 2015
2. Horizontal stabilizer from tail section, found between Mozambique and Madagascar in December 2015

article Up to now most train companies have only offered vouchers as compensation.
The voucher system has long been criticised by consumer groups, as vouchers cannot always be used online or to access the cheapest fares.
The Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators and Network Rail, said the change would come in this summer.
"Planned changes to the National Rail Conditions of Carriage will enable passengers to claim their compensation in cash, instead of rail vouchers," said a spokesman.
"This will be a welcome move for passengers."
It is not yet known whether customers with existing vouchers will be able to swap them for cash.
The move marks a major change in policy, as the current voucher system has been in place for around 20 years.
The news was welcomed by Transport Focus, which has campaigned on the issue for some time.
James Daley, a consumer expert with Fairer Finance, called it "a victory for common sense".
It was also welcomed by Budd Shenkin and his wife Ann, two Californian tourists who were frustrated by the voucher system.
After paying for first-class tickets on a train from Inverness to Edinburgh last month, they boarded the train to find no first class available.
When they tried to get a refund at the ticket office, they were told they could only have vouchers - of little use to a couple only in the UK on holiday.
"They sold us seats that didn't exist - and then wouldn't give us our money back," said Ann, a retired lawyer.
But her husband Budd said he was pleased to see that good sense had now prevailed.
"Implementation is always an issue, however," he told the BBC.
"Nothing short of putting a credit onto the customer's credit card without a physical visit to the office should be acceptable."
After being approached by the BBC, ScotRail eventually agreed to refund their money.
However, Transport Focus is still concerned that too few people claim refunds when their trains are delayed.
In a survey published in 2013, it found that 88% of passengers entitled to compensation did not bother to ask for it.
And that's despite the fact that the rules on compensation have been widely toughened up.
Nearly half of the 26 train operators have adopted the so-called Delay Repay guarantee, which means passengers are entitled to redress after a delay of as little as 30 minutes.
Furthermore, those train companies cannot get out of paying by claiming that the delay was not their fault, because they, in their turn, can claim compensation from Network Rail if the delay was caused by signalling problems or other network issues.
The companies not signed up to Delay Repay usually offer compensation when a train is at least 60 minutes late.
summary The government has announced plans to introduce a new system of compensation for passengers who miss trains.

article The midfielder submitted a transfer request after the Reds said he was not for sale and rejected a 100 million euros (£90m) bid from Barcelona.
Klopp suggested the decision was out of his hands as the "bosses will decide".
Liverpool drew 3-3 at Watford in their opening game of the season, which Coutinho missed with a back injury.
Ex-England defender Danny Mills told BBC Radio 5 live that Liverpool should "bite the bullet" and sell the 25-year-old.
He added: "I don't think Philippe Coutinho will stay at Anfield. He started with a statement calling for an amicable move, but four days later he submitted a transfer request. It is his dream move and I don't blame him in the slightest.
"Ultimately, Coutinho will simply remain unhappy and Liverpool simply need to bite the bullet. The club has a £100m asset there, a player who may want to force a move."
Spanish giants Barca have moved for the Brazilian after selling countryman Neymar to Paris St-Germain for a world record transfer of £200m.
The Spanish club's second offer to Liverpool for Coutinho, which was rejected immediately, comprised an initial 85 million euros (£76.8m) plus 15 million euros (£13.5m) in add-ons.
In a statement on Friday, Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group said its "definitive stance" was that "no offers will be considered".
Asked after Saturday's match if the transfer request changed anything, Klopp said: "You have to ask the club, but I don't think so because I think it was pretty clear what FSG said about it."
The German added to Sky Sports: "I am responsible for the whole team, all the players, so I need to be focused on the players who are available. The players who are not available, I have no influence over it.
"I have to accept decisions from the owners, that's how it is, and sometimes from the players. At this moment I am just concentrating on my team."
Liverpool signed Coutinho from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013 and midfielder was the club's leading scorer last season with 14 goals in all competitions.
He signed a new five-year deal in January, which did not include a release clause.
"In my opinion, Liverpool should say 'thank you very much for your service, we'll keep this professional, on you go'," ex-Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live.
"The problem is are Barcelona ever going to come back? If they go out and find someone else, that chance has gone.
"He will be looking at this from a player's perspective going: 'This is my opportunity. I've given everything I can for Liverpool, this is my one chance to get to Barcelona and I'm going to do whatever it takes to get there'.
"It is going to get messy. The player wants to leave. The club have given him almost nowhere to move."
Former England defender Matthew Upson feels otherwise. He said: "I think Philippe Coutinho could well still be at Liverpool at the end of the transfer window. A lot of money is on offer but I can't see that Liverpool need that money."
summary Liverpool have signed defender Jürgen Klopp on a two-year contract.

Sangakkara, who retired from international cricket in 2015, says he will quit first-class cricket after this season.
The left-hander has scored 45,529 runs in all forms of cricket.
He brought up his hundred - his eighth of the season in all formats - with a single to third man off Matt Fisher as Surrey posted 313-7. Yorkshire managed 289-9 in reply.
Sangakkara has enjoyed a stellar summer in County Championship Division One, averaging 90.60 in six matches.
Last month he fell 16 runs short of becoming only the fourth player to make six consecutive first-class centuries.
The former Sri Lanka captain is fifth on the all-time list of leading Test run scorers with 12,400 in 134 Tests, and only India legend Sachin Tendulkar has made more than Sangakkara's 14,234 runs in 404 one-day internationals.

article The 70th anniversary of victory in World War Two is an opportunity for the Russian military to show off some of its latest equipment.
And President Vladimir Putin can demonstrate to his own people, and to the world, that Russia is back in the military equivalent of the premier league.
Russia's armed forces modernisation is still very much a work in progress. But the fighting in eastern Ukraine has demonstrated that, over recent years, elements of the Russian army have significantly improved, in equipment and capability.
Keir Giles, an expert on the Russian armed forces at the Conflict Studies Research Centre, says the current military reform has been going on for seven years, and was "kick-started by Russia's military performance in the war with Georgia in 2008".
"Russia won that war convincingly," he says, "but confirmed in the process that the way its troops were organised and equipped was out of date.
"Since then, Russia has been working hard to overhaul almost every aspect of its military, including massive investment in new weapons systems - everything from nuclear weapons down to the uniforms and equipment carried by individual soldiers."
The fighting in eastern Ukraine has demonstrated that military reform is already bearing fruit. Nato commanders point to the Russians' improved use of electronic warfare, unmanned drones and better logistical support.
"Russia has taken what was left of the Soviet Army and finally turned it into a fighting force designed for 21st-Century conflict," Mr Giles says.
There is still a lot of work to do, and Russia's economic position has inevitably been weakened by the fall in oil prices and Western sanctions, following Russia's seizure of Crimea last year and its actions in eastern Ukraine.
But Igor Sutyagin, a military analyst at the RUSI think-tank in London, argues that money for military modernisation appears to have been ring-fenced.
There remain "deep institutional problems in the Russian government model", he says: problems that will persist even if oil prices rise and sanctions are ultimately lifted.
The Armata T-14 tank is a revolutionary vehicle for the Russians - the first truly new tank design since the Cold War.
All of Russia's current tank models are essentially upgrades of a design that goes back to 1964, when the T-64 went into service.
As Igor Sutyagin explained, that old design is now obsolete, "too compact to insert anything new into it".
"It was designed in a different environment - for World War Two-type engagements, tank-on-tank.
"Today, anti-tank weapons attack tanks from the top and it is effectively impossible to improve the protection of a T-64 type. So the Russian army needed a fundamentally different design - that was the promise of Armata."
The Armata may symbolise the Russian military's future, but it makes much wider use of electronics on-board, and Igor Sutyagin says that is a problem.
"Up to 80% of the chip-sets for the most critical electronics in the Russian electronics industry are imported - and mainly imported from the West."
Even if sanctions are lifted, he thinks a legacy will remain and, as in the Cold War years, there may be significant restrictions on exports to Russia with potential military uses.
Russian World War Two parade: A tank-spotter's guide
Russia's rift with Ukraine has even greater immediate significance.
As Keir Giles notes, "another major headache for military modernisation is the loss of access to the Ukrainian defence industry.
"Even this long after the end of the USSR, some parts of the Russian and Ukrainian military-industrial complexes still functioned in close co-operation. Now, Russia has to source key components for its warships, aircraft and weapons systems elsewhere - or start to build them itself."
Igor Sutyagin agrees. "Russian defence officials openly recognise that 30% of Ukrainian imports to Russia's defence industry cannot be substituted domestically. One-third is large enough, when you bear in mind that one out of every five pieces of Russian military hardware is either Ukrainian or depends upon Ukrainian parts."
Of course, no military the size of Russia's can be modernised in one go. Russia prioritised strategic nuclear forces, with new missiles and submarines.
For the army, "the priorities were special forces and the airborne assault troops," Keir Giles says.
"One result was the highly capable special forces troops that appeared on the streets of Crimea in February 2014."
But improvements have also been rolling out "across the whole of the army", he says.
Western analysts believe the Russian army may be facing manpower challenges in maintaining forces close to Ukraine. But the conclusion was that Russia might be able "only" to put 90-100,000 men in the field, "which still dwarfs anything Ukraine's Western neighbours might be able to muster to resist Russian pressure", Mr Giles says.
A worry for Western observers of Russia's military modernisation is the frequent reference to nuclear weapons by Russian officials.
Igor Sutyagin says such talk reflects Russia's awareness of its "inability to compete on equal terms with the West in conventional terms".
Particularly alarming for Keir Giles is the new emphasis on the potential use of nuclear weapons, by senior government officials including President Putin.
"It is another example of how military posturing that makes perfect sense in Moscow is incomprehensible in the West. Soviet offensive plans for Europe included early use of tactical nuclear weapons, and they still play a significant - but not publicly acknowledged - role in Russian doctrine."
The experience of Crimea, he says, "shows that just because something is unimaginable for Western planners, this does not mean it is not considered a viable option by Russia".

article As finance minister, she referred his long-running dispute with bank Credit Lyonnais to an arbitration panel, which awarded him 400m euros (Â£340m) damages.
Mr Tapie was a supporter of ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Critics say she abused her authority but Ms Lagarde denies any wrongdoing.
"This search will help uncover the truth, which will contribute to exonerating my client from any criminal wrongdoing," Ms Lagarde's lawyer, Yves Repiquet, told the Reuters news agency.
The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says investigators suspect Mr Tapie was granted a deal in return for his support of President Sarkozy in the 2007 election.
There is speculation in France that Ms Lagarde could yet be placed under formal investigation in this case, he adds.
The origins of the case date back 20 years.
Mr Tapie, who has long been active in French business, sporting and political circles, sued Credit Lyonnais over its handling of the sale in 1993 of sportswear brand Adidas, in which he was a majority stakeholder.
After years in the courts, the case was referred by Ms Lagarde to an arbitration panel in 2007 and she approved its decision to award damages.
Critics said the case should not have been settled by private arbitration, since public money was at stake in the bank, which was part-owned by the state.
The settlement Mr Tapie received is believed to be a far greater sum than he would likely have received from the courts.
In an interview in January, Ms Lagarde stood by her decision, saying it was "the best solution at the time".
Ms Lagarde replaced the disgraced IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was arrested in New York in 2011 on allegations of attempted rape.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers settled a civil case for an undisclosed sum and a criminal investigation was dropped by US prosecutors last year.
However, our correspondent says that Ms Lagarde's position at the IMF could be in jeopardy if she is placed under formal investigation.
Her term as IMF chief does not expire until 2016, but amid the complexities of Europe's economic crisis this is a distraction she can ill afford, he adds.

The data comes after a similar survey of manufacturing on Monday showed its first contraction in two years.
Within the construction sector there was an increase in commercial and civil engineering orders but a small decrease in residential orders.
"Following a recent flurry of disappointing surveys and data, it is actually somewhat of a relief to see construction activity expand at a similar pace in July to June," said Howard Archer an economist from IHS Global Insight.
It was the 17th successive monthly rise in construction orders.
Confidence amongst construction companies improved slightly but Markit said it remained subdued by historical standards.
However, PMI surveys are not always a reliable indicator of economic performance.
Data from the Office of National statistics showed the construction industry contracted during the winter despite surveys indicating solid growth in orders.

article Scotland's scores for maths, reading and science all declined in the latest set of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures.
It was the first time since the tests began in 2000 that all three subject areas were classed as "average", with none "above average".
Education Secretary John Swinney said the results made uncomfortable reading.
He said they showed that "radical reform" was needed if Scotland's education system was to become world-class again.
Opposition parties said the results showed a "decade of educational failure" under the SNP government, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously saying she wanted to be judged on her record on education.
Teachers called for a "period of stability" following the results, which saw Scotland fall from "above average" in reading and science to "average".
The Pisa testing system was set up in 2000 among countries from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Half a million 15-year-olds took part in the latest round of tests, which cover literacy, numeracy and science, in March 2015.
Scotland's scores in the latest tests were lower in all three areas than they had been in any previous Pisa survey, with the country's ranking for science dropping from "above average" to "average", while maths and reading both remained "average".
In 2000, when Scotland first took part in the OECD survey of 15-year-olds, its performance in reading, science and maths were all above average.
While Scotland remains within the statistical average for the OECD, its relative position against some overseas countries and some other UK administrations has slipped, with the number of countries recording better scores in each subject increasing and the number recording worse scores falling.
In maths, only five countries had better scores in 2000, and 21 countries had worse.
By 2015, 14 countries recorded better results, while the number with worse scores was down to 10.
The comparison with other parts of the UK suggest that English pupils were "significantly above" Scots in science while Welsh schools performed "significantly below Scotland" in each topic.
For science, the results showed 12 countries doing better than Scotland, including England, Australia, Estonia, Finland and Slovenia.
In mathematics, Estonia, Finland and Slovenia again scored above Scotland, as did Norway, Belgium, Ireland and Poland.
There were also 13 countries with higher scores in reading, including Estonia, Poland and Slovenia, as well as Ireland, Finland and Norway.
Countries such as Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Norway maintained their performance but moved ahead of Scotland as its score declined.
Meanwhile, Slovenia saw a 24-point improvement over the three years, going from below Scotland to being ranked above it.
Mr Swinney, who made a ministerial statement at Holyrood on the results, pledged an "unwavering focus on improvement".
He said: "There is great strength in Scottish education but these results underline the case for radical reform of Scotland's education system.
"The results undoubtedly make uncomfortable reading but they contain a plain message: we must continue to make the changes that are necessary to strengthen Scottish education."
The education secretary told MSPs that the poverty-related attainment gap was a "complex challenge".
He pointed out that the latest Pisa survey was carried out in March 2015, saying that a "range of actions" had been taken since to improve education.
Mr Swinney said there was a "relentless drive to reduce red tape and ensure teachers are freed up to teach", pointing to changes to National Qualifications to address the burden of over-assessment on young people and teachers.
He said that he had spoken with his international panel of advisors, who did not describe an education system in crisis but the need to "remain focused on taking forward the careful plans" already in place.
And he also said some responsibility fell on local authorities, which he said had been fairly treated in government budgets, saying he had actually prevented many Labour-run councils from reducing teacher numbers.
Recent years have seen the Curriculum for Excellence introduced in Scottish schools, and the country's qualifications system overhauled.
Scottish Secondary Teachers Association president Euan Duncan said the changes had "added tremendously to the pressure on teachers and youngsters".
He said: "Furthermore, reductions in support staff and shortages of supply teachers have taken teachers away from their core function.
"There is no magic solution to improving the downward Pisa performance trend, but good starting points would be to provide teachers with very clear aims and sufficient resources with which to achieve them."
But Scotland's largest teaching union, the EIS, warned against making "snap judgements" based on the Pisa figures, and said it was important to instead "analyse the full range of data it makes available".
Its general secretary, Larry Flanagan, added: "The need for continuing investment in education is made clear, however, by this report.
"The Scottish government must ensure that schools are properly resourced and supported if we are to achieve the goals of tackling the poverty-related attainment gap and providing all young people with the chance to reach their potential."
Scotland is not a star pupil. The country's performance in the PISA assessments is distinctly average. A teacher writing a report card could easily say: "Disappointing performance. Could do better."
The Pisa figures are not the last word on education. They are not a definitive measure. There are many critics. But because they are the nearest thing there is to a fair way of comparing the education systems of different countries they have a huge influence on policy and political debate.
One reason they make for such uncomfortable reading for the Scottish government, is that it wants to be judged by its success on education. It makes much of its commitment to raise attainment and narrow the gap between how well youngsters from relatively rich and poor areas do at school.

Scottish Conservative education spokesman Liz Smith said the "shocking statistics" were a "damning indictment of a decade of failure under the SNP".
She added: "The fact that the SNP has been so obsessed with independence has meant that it has taken its eye completely off the ball when it comes to education.
"Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to be judged by her performance on education but parents will rightly wonder what on earth her Scottish government has been doing for the last 10 years.
"Children going through our schools under the SNP are finishing their school careers less equipped in basic skills and performing less well than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, and in a host of other countries across the world."
Scottish Labour's education spokesman Iain Gray said: "SNP ministers should be ashamed of these results. For all their warm words about making education a priority we are seeing performance going backwards as Scotland drops down international league tables."
Mr Gray asked Mr Swinney to apologise for the figures and called on Finance Secretary Derek Mackay to protect council funding in his forthcoming budget. Mr Swinney said the statistics were "unacceptable and must be improved upon", but insisted there had been "strong, fair settlements for local authorities" under the SNP.
Ross Greer of the Scottish Greens said: "This drop in performance is clearly a concern. We need to listen to teachers and invest in what they know will make a difference - namely more staff and a simplified workload following years of changes, so that they have more time to connect with their students."
And Tavish Scott of the Lib Dems said there was "no escaping the fact that surveys show the SNP have overseen a worrying decline in our education system". He asked if there would be a reduction in the 20,000 pages of guidance given to teachers, leading Mr Swinney to say that there would be a "huge reduction in the volume of paperwork".
Meanwhile Keir Bloomer, of think tank Reform Scotland and chair of the Commission on School Reform, said the education system was now in urgent need of action.
He said: "It is no longer credible to describe Scotland's education system as world leading.
"There is a critical and urgent need to examine how Scottish education is run, and the Scottish government's stated intention to empower teachers, parents and schools must be matched by action."

Tylicki was injured in a four-horse pile-up at Kempton on 31 October.
Speaking to the BBC's 5 live Daily, he says he was born to be a jockey and "wouldn't regret it one day".
The 30-year-old, who has not watched a replay of his fall, said "things were sometimes very difficult" but he was focused on staying positive.
Tylicki's life changed forever at what should have been a mundane Monday meeting at Kempton Park in Surrey.
He fell heavily from his mount, Nellie Dean, when appearing to clip heels with leader and eventual winner Madame Butterfly as the field rounded the home turn.
"A few of my colleagues have watched the fall - I haven't myself," he said. "They were saying I'm actually very lucky to be here.
"There's no point for me to watch it. I was there, that's enough. I do remember everything. Unfortunately that's racing in a way."
Tylicki spent a fortnight in intensive care and left hospital in late December to continue his rehabilitation at the London Spinal Cord Unit, with support from the Injured Jockeys' Fund.
"When you're in hospital things are very, very tough. You move on to rehab then and you get to learn these new skills and new ways of doing everything," he said.
The change cannot be overstated - from riding thoroughbreds at 30mph to life in a wheelchair. Tylicki is philosophical.
"You are having to accept things in a different way, which can trouble you. You've got good days and bad days, but at the moment I'm taking every day as it comes. For me that's the best way to handle the situation," he added.
"There's always someone worse than you. You've just got to do the best you can out of the situation. Staying positive is the main thing. It can be hard sometimes and easier other days. You've just got to learn how to deal with it."
Tylicki broke 18 ribs in the fall, but most significant of all was the T7 paralysis, which meant he no longer had movement in the lower half of his body.
"The first time I woke up after the operation - I was lying in bed and I knew I couldn't feel anything. That's when I knew I was in trouble," he said.
"Shortly after that, the doctor filled me in on what happened - the injuries I'd received. I just had to get cracking from then on."
The support I've been getting is tremendous and unbelievable
Exercises and physiotherapy now form part of his daily routine. Being shown how to dress himself, make his bed, go swimming and drive a car are all part of his rehabilitation.
"Each individual here has a timetable and you'll be kept busy until 5 o'clock," he said.
"You get to learn an awful lot. Having had a certain level of fitness before has helped me massively in some ways.
"I'm living my life day to day. The immune system is very low and infections can happen easily, but I'm concentrating on my rehab and physio."
He has been reading a lot, with a book on gambler Barney Curley - a present from trainer Jamie Osborne - next on his list.
Tylicki was born in Germany, the son of three-time German champion jockey Andrzej.
"I was born to do it. My father was a very, very good jockey and from a very young age I decided to go down that route," he said.
"I saw the ups and downs and the toughness of the job but from around 12 years of age I knew I was going to be a jockey."
Tylicki Jr was champion apprentice in Britain in 2009 and his career was on an upward curve, winning the Group One Prix de l'Opera race on Speedy Boarding at Chantilly in France just a few weeks before his Kempton fall.
"I had some very good years and some lovely winners, especially last year winning the Prix de l'Opera was definitely the icing on the cake," he said.
Tylicki said racing had given him "a tremendous way of life" and he was aware of the dangers despite falls being relatively rare in Flat racing.
"I think if you ask any Flat jockey they'd agree the jump jockeys are much braver than us Flat lads - one in every 10 rides is a fall. They're much, much tougher," he said.
"On the Flat you're going at great speed so when you do get a fall it's always 'how bad it is?' and this time I didn't get away with it.
"Accidents do happen in racing. It's a risky sport and you're aware of it as a jockey, but you don't think about it. Things can happen.
"When you've won on a few horses that absolutely took off with you - there's nothing better than that. I'm glad I've experienced that."
A GoFundMe page to raise money to help Tylicki's recovery, set up by At The Races television presenter Matt Chapman, collected more than £330,000.
He has been visited by a variety of jockeys and trainers, and received widespread support on social media from racing fans.
"The racing community is little compared to everything else in the world  but there's some fantastic people in it - the support I've been getting is tremendous and unbelievable," he said.
"I don't quite know how to thank everyone. It's been absolutely amazing."
Tylicki's sister Madeleine won her first race as a trainer three weeks after her brother's accident.
"It really was just pretty amazing," he said. "I was listening to it on my phone in bed and when the horse crossed the line I Facetimed her. Davy Russell, who rode the horse, answered the phone to me and said: 'This one's for you Freddy.'
"It was a fantastic feeling for the whole family but especially Madeleine and her partner Andrew."

article About 90,000 teachers were locked out after negotiations broke down and nearly 900,000 pupils have no classes.
A teachers' union spokesman called the action "historic" for Denmark.
Gordon Madsen told BBC News that the government and teachers' employers wanted teachers to spend more time in the classroom during the school day.
The changes would mean younger children spending about two more hours in school daily and the oldest children three more hours, he said.
Mr Madsen said the teachers' time for preparing lessons would be reduced under the reforms. The teachers are pushing for a cap of 25 hours a week spent teaching, so that it is clear what counts as overtime.
The dispute affects children between the ages of six and 16. They are now spending their time at home with family members, or at their parents' workplaces or at youth clubs.
"Teachers are protesting in the streets all over Denmark," Mr Madsen said.
He accused the centre-left government of doing a deal on school reform with the local authority organisation KL, which pre-empted negotiations with the national teachers' union.
"It's the first time all the teachers have been locked out. It's a threat to the Danish model," he said, explaining that traditionally in Scandinavia workplace conditions are negotiated directly between unions and the employers without government interference.
Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt defended the plan to introduce longer hours in school, and said her government was not yet prepared to intervene in the dispute.
"We cannot accept that an average of three or four children in each class never learn to write at a level that enables them to go on to further education," she said on Tuesday.

article The LEADER scheme is a European Union and Scottish government programme administered by a local action group.
It aims to support small and micro businesses, farm diversification projects and social enterprises.
The key areas it hopes to boost are "tourism, food and drink, creative industries and renewables".
Councillor Stuart Bell said the funding was "excellent news" for the region and would help strengthen the economy.
"In previous years we have seen a fantastic range of projects achieve great things on the back of receiving funding through the LEADER programme, and I know that this will be the case again as the fund reopens to new applications," he said.
The scheme has the following funding available:
It is expected that the fund will start to award the first grants in June 2016.

article The session will be held in September to select new leaders for the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the North Korean Central News Agency said.
Analysts say the move may signal a transition of power in the secretive country.
Leader Kim Jong-il is believed to be in ill health and grooming one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, to succeed him.
The meeting is "for electing [the party's] highest leading body reflecting the new requirements of the WPK", the announcement said.
"We are now faced with the sacred revolutionary tasks to develop the WPK... into an eternal glorious party of Kim Il-sung and further increase its militant function and role to glorify the country as a great prosperous and powerful socialist nation."
Kim Jong-il took over as leader from his father, North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung, after his death in 1994.
With Kim Jong-il thought to be in ill health following a suspected stroke in 2008, analysts believe the conference will be held to elevate the status of his third son, Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un.
Earlier this week the director of South Korea's National Intelligence Service said that the 27-year-old is already taking a role in policy-making and frequently accompanies his father on inspection tours.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says Kim Jong-il himself began his official role to succeed his father by assuming a senior party position at a convention in 1980.
The announcement comes a day after the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the three-year war between North and South Korea.
It also follows a warning from the United States to North Korea to refrain from "actions that increase tensions in the region," amid concerns that Pyongyang may be preparing a new round of missile tests.
The US state department said it was aware North Korea had issued a nine-day ban on shipping off its western coast.
Tensions between North and South Korea have increased following the 26 March sinking of a South Korean warship, which an international investigation concluded was sunk by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine.
summary North Korea has announced plans to hold a new leadership election.

article Asked about reports linking the 21-year-old with Marseille, Rodgers said "100%" no talks had taken place.
"Moussa has been linked with 10 clubs," he said. "There's nothing in it from our perspective.
"There's no rush from Moussa. He loves being here. He knows he is in an incredible environment where he can learn and improve."
Dembele scored 32 goals in 39 games in all competitions for Celtic last season, his first since arriving from Fulham for a compensation fee of £500,000.
Celtic host Rosenborg in a Champions League qualifier at Celtic Park on Wednesday.
Dembele did not train on Tuesday because of injury, according to Rodgers.
The France Under-21 international has three years to run on his contract and Rodgers said he had not spoken to the player about his future this summer.
"Part of the plan for Moussa coming in here was that, if he progressed how I thought he would progress and if he wanted to move at any time, it was going to be after the second year," said Rodgers.
"The projection was that he could come here and improve, develop and win trophies and then look as a young player to go and show that he has the consistency to go again the next season.
"To be a successful player, you have to have the mentality to keep going year in, year out.
"He doesn't change either way. There can be lots of speculation. He gets on with his work.
"There will be a natural solution. There will be something at some point in his career here when there is an offer which is a sensible one for both parties.
"It's certainly nowhere near that at this moment. He's a player we want to keep and, if anything ever did come in, we would assess it.
"I haven't put a price on what that would be. What I know is that he's a 21-year-old who is developing and growing and has all the qualities to play at the very highest level."

article It comes a day after it announced more than 1,000 job losses.
The company usually takes on about 40 apprentices every year for a four year training programme.
The scheme was assessed by the Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) last year as "very good" with some "outstanding" elements.
The firm said it will "support existing apprentices to complete their training and gain relevant qualifications".
At the time of the ETI inspection the firm had 140 apprentices, 20 of whom were on the pilot higher level programme.
Over the four year scheme apprentices work towards NVQs in aircraft fitting or engineering.
First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will do what she can to soften the blow of the job losses.
Meanwhile, a company which is one of Bombardier's biggest local parts suppliers says its saddened by the cuts.
However, Raymond Semple of Moyola Precision Engineeering, said he was confident about its own future, despite Bombardier's troubles.
"It's a major thing losing 1,000 jobs. Those people trying to get employment, it's not going to be all that easy for them," he said.
"For us as a company, we're quite confident we'll still be going forward. It's a global business here."

article Saracens took the honours on the pitch, returning to the top of the table with a 26-16 victory over struggling London Irish, but did the decision to schedule a game on the other side of the Atlantic pay off?
Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty says the planning for next year's return visit has already started with the aim of selling-out a regular season game at the 25,000 stadium by 2018.
McCafferty, one of many driving forces behind taking England's top-flight competition to north America, believes they now have a template for future growth.
"It's always a challenge to get through the first one, but I think we've made a really good start," he told BBC Sport after the full-time whistle.
But, on a weekend when the Six Nations took a pivotal twist, the inaugural game was battling for recognition in its own country, let alone trying to break into the American sporting consciousness.
"I don't imagine it changing for next year (from a Six Nations weekend)," McCafferty said. "But, I do imagine a point in future when that would be the case.
"We have to plan around winter. Early March is a good time of year with not competing too much with the other US sports, which are obviously huge."
Despite a week of publicity events and both sets of players meeting the local community, it was hard to find any column inches or much radio or TV time devoted to publicising the game to the US audience.
The main talk on the New York sporting agenda in the build-up to Saturday's game centred around who local NFL sides the Jets and the Giants will try to snap up as free agents, and college basketball's Big East series coming to town at Madison Square Garden.
Saturday's crowd of 14,800, which is around average for a domestic Premiership fixture was labelled "a good starting position" by the organisers.
"We've got to make sure we have a date in the calendar that gives us the best possible chance at it being successful," McCafferty added.
"I guess our message is 'Premiership rugby's in town'," he added. "We want to get as many Americans out there as possible watching it."
Saracens' Alex Goode, who scored 19 points in the game: "Anywhere we can grow the game and get more fans on board is brilliant. It's a huge role for the game to keep expanding, keep bringing the popularity of the game to new places.
"Maybe we've done it today, we don't know. But's it's been great for the fans and the players to have a different scenery and we've really enjoyed ourselves and the American people have been great."
London Irish winger Alex Lewington, a first-half try-scorer: "I'd love to play here every week to be honest.
"The size and quality of the pitch were unbelievable. It was amazing and I'd love to do it again next year."
London Irish scrum-half Scott Steele: "It's not very often that you get the chance to go to New York with your usual job. The training facilities that we used during the week with the New York Jets were amazing.
"When I first heard about the idea of taking a game away, factors like jetlag came to mind. But, we got looked after really well by everybody and it's been a really good occasion."
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall: "An occasion like this deserves us to be able to come here with our full squad. That wasn't to be because it's in the middle of the Six Nations.
"I do feel it needs to be organised at a time of the year when all the stars you can have here are going to be here.
"We had a lot who played very well for England against Wales. I think America would love to see the likes of Maro Itoje, George Kruis and Billy Vunipola.

"But, it felt like something different. Not like a run-of-the-mill Premiership match, which is an important thing."
London Irish head coach Tom Coventry: "Spending some time together on a tour in the middle of a Premiership season is very unusual.
"There's been plenty of positives, the only negative (for us) has been the result really.
"I think it's a progression of growing the game of rugby union in general. For Premiership Rugby, I think it's a positive step forward."
A meeting of top v bottom might have been viewed as something of a mis-match before kick-off, but the actual result reflected a hard-fought contest.
'Home side' London Irish, eight points adrift of safety, gave an encouraging account of themselves in their must-win scenario, particularly in the first-half.
Curious locals among the crowd were treated to two well-taken tries in the opening 40 minutes from Saracens and England full-back Alex Goode and Exiles winger Alex Lewington as Irish took a well-deserved six-point lead into the break.
But Irish were once again not clinical enough in the second half, when Saracens turned the screw to score 20 points to their three.
The scrappy nature of centre Nick Tompkins' match-winning try late on summed up the Exiles' lack of good fortune in their struggle at the Premiership's basement.
End result: Saracens get a big result in the Big Apple by going back above Exeter at the summit, Irish remain deep in the mire with the threat of relegation increasingly looming with just six games to play.

article The 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee rolled backwards down the steep drive after he got out, pinning him against a fence.
In April, Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.1m vehicles worldwide over the risk they could roll away after drivers exit.
The issue had been linked to 41 injuries, it said.
Fiat Chrysler, which owns Jeep, said it was extending its "deepest sympathies" to Yelchin's family and friends.
"The company will be conducting a thorough investigation of this tragic incident. It is premature to speculate on its cause at this time," it said in a statement.
LA police told CBS News that it appeared Yelchin had not properly put the car in park mode.
The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had found there was a safety risk if drivers got out of some Fiat Chrysler models without first putting them in park mode, Fiat Chrysler said in April.
The company had told owners it hoped to come up with a "permanent" remedy later this year.
Police investigators have not established any connection between the transmission in Yelchin's Jeep and the incident that took his life.
An autopsy performed on Sunday determined the 27-year-old died of blunt force asphyxia, the coroner's office said.
Mr Yelchin, who was best known for playing Chekov in the new Star Trek films - a role originally made famous by Walter Koenig in the rebooted Star Trek films released in 2009 and 2013.
He reprised the role in a third film, Star Trek Beyond, which is due for release next month.
An only child, Yelchin was born to professional figure skaters in Leningrad (now St Petersburg) in Russia, who moved to the US when he was still a baby.
His first screen role was in US drama ER in 2000 and appeared in more than a dozen TV series and films before his break out role in 2006's Alpha Dog.
Among his other big screen credits were Charlie Bartlett (2007), Terminator Salvation (2009), Fright Night (2011), Odd Thomas (2013) and horror Green Room, released last year.
The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote an appreciation of the actor saying: "A hugely popular and well-liked actor of enormous talent and potential has been snuffed out. What a waste."
According to IMDB, he had four other film projects due for release - sci-fi Rememory, dramas We Don't Belong Here and Porto, and thriller Thoroughbred.

article Ahead of his party's conference in Perth, he told BBC Scotland it was the "democratic thing to do".
The complex negotiations required for the UK to end its membership of the European Union are due to begin soon.
Mr Rennie said he respected the will of the people, however, they did not vote last June for the "destination".
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, the MSP said the whole of the UK needed to be kept in the EU.
When presenter Gary Robertson reminded Mr Rennie that the vote was to end European membership, he responded: "I am in favour of fighting for what I believe in.
"I'm not going to give up in the face of this isolationist approach to the world, the Donald Trump approach, the Brexit approach and I would argue that the decision to break up the UK too is a regressive approach.
"I am not going to stand down in the face of that challenge. I am going to stand up for strong liberal values."
Members of the Liberal Democrats have gathered for their two-day conference which will feature a keynote speech from Mr Rennie and addresses from Scotland's only Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.
Mr Rennie explained that current UK leader Tim Farron would not be attending because he had an "important family birthday this weekend".
On the question of another Scottish independence referendum, the Holyrood politician said he did not want one but he conceded that it would be "close, no doubt" if held.
He added: "What we need to do is put forward a very positive uplifting case for the UK.
"This is not just about numbers on a spreadsheet, this is about making sure that we have got a positive case that people can rally around.
"I believe in working with our partners, our neighbours across the UK."
During the conference there will be policy debates on the UK and Europe, mental health, consumer advocacy and HGV speed limits.

article Mark Jenkins has been told by Ocaso his claim in November is being refused because he did not declare the house in Maesteg was within 200m of a river.
Ogmore AM Huw-Irranca Davies said the flooding was nothing to do with the river and the firm was "unreasonable".
Ocaso said it was "in discussions" with Mr Jenkins.
People living in Maesteg described the flooding that followed heavy rain in November, caused by Storm Angus, as "devastating".
Mr Jenkins estimates it caused about Â£50,000 of damage to his house and is challenging Ocaso's decision not to pay out.
He, his wife Cerys and their children Sami, 11 and Lewi, two, had to move out and are living with her parents.
"It's a bit of a struggle as you can imagine, four of us in one room," he said.
"[Our] two-year-old [was] looking forward to one of his first major Christmases in the house, that's not going to happen.
"It's just utter devastation at the moment - we're just making do.
"We're just lucky we've got close family to put us up because otherwise we're effectively homeless because we can't live here."
Mr Jenkins said he does not "recall" the question about the proximity of a river being asked and said the insurer was "nit-picking".
Mr Irranca-Davies, the local AM and a former UK government floods minister, said Ocaso's handling of the case had been "terrible".
"They need to show some compassion," he said.
"Anybody with an ounce of decency would understand that this was out of the blue skies, it was a deluge of a flood, nothing to do with river flooding.
"It's a genuine claim for a couple and their family and their children who are now out of their home for Christmas, whose home is in devastation.
"Show some decency, I say to this company, and pay up.
"It's giving the insurance industry a bad name."
A spokesman for Ocaso said: "We are in discussions with our policyholder regarding this matter and the information provided when the policy was initially proposed.
"It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage."
The Welsh Government has written to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) about the case.
In the letter, Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said her officials believe the flood was not caused by "any main river".
An ABI spokeswoman said: "Insurance is there to provide help and support when the worst happens.
"It's important people answer questions honestly and to the best of their knowledge when taking out a policy so the insurer can assess the risk they're at and set their premium appropriately.
"The Financial Ombudsman Service exists to investigate any cases where a customer feels they have not been treated fairly.
"The insurance industry takes the availability of property insurance for flood risk areas very seriously which is why it worked with Government to set up the world first Flood Re scheme, which exists to ensure people can access affordable insurance for their homes.
"It's always a good idea to shop around when buying insurance to find the best priced policy to suit your situation."
Mr Irranca-Davies has also called for rules to change so that insurance companies themselves identify how close a customer's house is to a river, rather than customers having to declare it themselves.
In response, the ABI said it was down to individual firms to decide what approach to take.

article Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has told executive colleagues he would like to produce a one-year plan for all day-to-spending in 2017/18.
"There is too much uncertainty in the air," he told BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business programme.
He added a one-year budget was "the prudent way forward".
The budget cannot be put together until Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement, with its likely knock-on consequences for the Stormont block grant.
The executive had been working towards a multi-year budget which would cover the entire period up until the next Stormont election in 2021.
While he has proposed a one-year budget, Mr Ó Muilleoir said he also intended to produce a separate four-year budget for capital spending that will cover projects, including the A5 and A6 roads.
He said he was also firming up details of a "stimulus package," promising "plenty of actions to build up the economy."
"It's very important we don't fall into the trap of focussing on where the [Brexit] negotiations will bring us and forget about the here and now," he added. "And the here and now is getting young people into work".

article This private university, with its own degree-awarding powers, will be among the lowest charging, alongside the Open University.
There will also be more intensively taught degree courses, which will cost £12,000 for two years.
Chief executive Carl Lygo said the private university college wanted to "challenge the educational status quo".
Mr Lygo said the fee level would allow students to "start their chosen career without a mountain of debt".
The government wants to promote a market in tuition fees - raising the upper limit to £9,000 per year.
The range of charges is now emerging - with the highest for an undergraduate degree course so far set to be £36,000 for a four-year course in Edinburgh, payable by students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Scottish students will not have to pay tuition fees at Scotland's universities.
A majority of universities in England have set tuition fees of between £8,000 and £9,000 for some or all their courses.
The announcement of fees from BPP University College will lead to a three-year degree course costing £15,000. An accelerated degree course, where students work through the summer, will cost £12,000 for two years.
It will also mean that students at this private university will be able to apply for student finance in the same way as students at public universities.
The government announced earlier this year that students at private higher education institutions could borrow up to £6,000 per year to cover fees.
This will be the charge for undergraduate courses in law, business, accountancy and finance at the university college's bases in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Swindon and Manchester.
The university college says it has 6,500 students at its law and business schools, and trains more than 30,000 accountants.
It challenges the traditional model of a university offering a three-year residential degree - and is aimed at students wanting work-related qualifications who might save money by living at home when studying.
"Universities have been forced, many for the first time, to make some tough decisions in order to compete in a changing and challenging environment," said Mr Lygo.
"At the heart of this is the student, who deserves value for money and the chance to improve their employability prospects and, as a sector, we mustn't lose sight of this."

Mr Mazurier told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that "justice had been done" and a "five year battle" had ended with the ruling.
His wife, Suja Jones Mazurier, has said she will appeal against the verdict.
She told an Indian television channel that his acquittal meant that her daughter "did not get justice".

The verdict was announced by a special fast track Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) court, which had examined 27 witnesses during the course of the trial.
Mr Mazurier was arrested and held in the crowded Parapanna Agrahara jail for three days, before being released on bail for 100,000 rupees ($1,548; Â£1,205).
He had spoken out against his arrest, insisting that he was innocent.

article The device, the only one if its kind in the UK, is the centrepiece of a new centre for designer quantum materials.
It will help create the next generation of electronic devices, one layer of atoms at a time.
There is no doubt that it looks fantastic.
It fills an entire laboratory. Its stainless steel tubes gleam. Its lights flash.
Its valves open and close and its computer monitors flicker.
Despite appearances it is science fact, not science fiction.
But what is it exactly? The answer trips off Dr Peter Wahl's tongue.
"This is a reactive oxide molecular beam epitaxy system," he says.
Happily for the rest of us he can also explain what that means.
"It is an instrument which allows us to build materials a single atomic layer at a time.
"So we can combine different materials, stacking them on top of each other, and basically changing the material with each individual layer."
To make these custom-engineered "supermaterials" the system uses high vacuums and temperatures.
Talk of the quantum world may bring to mind ideas like Schrodinger's Cat, which was supposedly alive and dead at the same time.
Creating quantum materials is a less intimidating concept.
It means manipulating things at their most basic level - in this case, atom by atom.
Dr Wahl, a reader in the school of physics and astronomy, makes it sound even less intimidating by invoking children's plastic bricks.
It is, he says, like playing Lego with atoms: putting two seemingly boring materials together as extremely thin films to make new stuff that's very interesting indeed.
"One relatively large field of potential applications for these materials is in what's called spintronics, where the spin of the electron suddenly becomes important and one can exploit it for new device functionalities."
Other potential applications include super-efficient energy distribution and high performance sensors.
It could lead to electronic devices that are a single atom thick.
Building exotic, designer, quantum materials does not come cheap.
The new centre represents an investment of Â£2m by the university, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA).
That's on top of previous investments of more than Â£4m by SUPA, the Scottish Funding Council and the university.
In return, St Andrews has created a facility that is unique in these islands to create materials that have never been seen before.

article Scottish Borders Council has agreed to give more than Â£500,000 to the project.
The Â£1.2m scheme would see the existing Jim Clark Room in Duns expanded and enhanced to allow cars and trophies to be put on display.
The aim is to open the museum in 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany aged just 32.
Born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in Duns in the Borders, Clark was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965 and won a total of 25 grand prix races.
He is still considered to be one of the finest racing drivers of all time.
He remains the only driver to have won both the Formula One and Indy 500 titles in the same year.
Councillor Vicky Davidson said she was delighted the financial commitment had been confirmed.
"The existing trophy room is a popular visitor attraction in its own right, but what will be created really befits the incredible achievements of this adopted Borderer and unassuming Berwickshire farmer," she said.
"The new museum will give us space to display some of Jim Clark's actual race cars along with his trophies and will put the museum up there with Scotland's foremost visitor attractions.
"The council would like to thank the Jim Clark Trust and its patrons as well as the wider motorsport community for their continuing support."
Doug Niven, who along with Ian Calder represents Clark's family on the Jim Clark Trust, said he looked forward to working with the council to ensure the plans come to fruition.
"Being able to display some of Jim's cars in an expanded museum in Duns has been a long-held dream of many people, and this commitment from the council takes us a lot closer to seeing that achieved," he said.

article Almost 34,000 airline tickets had to be cancelled in one 18-month period - with lack of staff to escort detainees one reason, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration report said.
A separate report suggests officials have lost track of thousands of foreign students whose visas have expired.
The Home Office said it was working to reduce cancelled and failed removals.
In some cases, the government argued cancellations were "out of [its] control", for example because of late legal challenges or disruptive behaviour of those scheduled for deportation.
However, the report said a lack of security staff to accompany detainees on their journey out of the UK was also a "major constraint".
The recorded loss on unused tickets was Â£1.4m - equivalent to 4% of the total amount spent on tickets
On average, the private company which is contracted to provide staff, Tascor, was only able to do so 15 days later than requested, inspectors said.
However, responding to the report, Tascor said it had no contractual requirement to complete removals within a specified timescale.
"The majority of the cancellations fall outside of Tascor's control, largely due to legal challenges or lack of emergency travel documents," the company added.
These two, rather dense, inspection reports merit close examination because they touch on a subject of public concern: Why is it that people who have no right to be in the UK cannot be removed?
The reasons are complex because the process is complex. If one link in the chain breaks down - a last-minute legal challenge, missing travel documents or no available security escorts - then the removal has to be cancelled.
However, the 15-day gap between the removal date requested by the Home Office and Tascor being able to provide staff suggests there are some serious recruitment problems that must be urgently addressed.
The worry is that the problems will not be fixed.
As the report on the student visa process points out, a recommendation by inspectors in 2012 for the removal of overseas students who are in the UK illegally to be made a priority has still not been acted upon.
Lucy Moreton, general secretary of ISU, which represents border agency and immigration staff, said recruiting more Tascor personnel could help the deportation process but "whether the Home Office would be prepared to pay for that is another matter".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "A large number of flights are missed because we simply can't move detainees from one place to another as we need to."
The report found that between October 2014 and March 2015, on average 2.5 flight tickets were issued for each individual successfully removed.
While some departments booked refundable tickets because of the high risk of cancellation, others simply chose the cheapest possible tickets which were normally not refundable, the report said.
The refund rate varied between 48% and 93% and there was "little obvious agreement" within the Home Office about how best to manage the problem, it said.
It recommended a regular review of the reasons for cancelled or failed removals, including those deemed "out of [Home Office] control", and develop guidance for caseworkers, for when to request refundable tickets.
A separate report suggests thousands of foreign students have fallen off the Home Office's radar - meaning the number who may have stayed in Britain illegally is unknown.
To get a visa, foreign students must produce a form from a licensed education establishment, which acts as their sponsor.
Under the terms of their licence, sponsors must notify the Home Office of any changes in a student's circumstances that would affect their sponsorship, such as failure to enrol on their course, a pattern of unauthorised absences, withdrawal or expulsion, or early completion of their studies.
Once notified, officials consider the case and decide whether to end the student's leave to remain in the UK.
The immigration watchdog said it found there was no process in place to monitor individuals in 71,601 cases in the two years to April 2015.
"Many of these individuals might have departed the UK, or might have been granted leave to remain on other grounds. However, the true position, including the number and whereabouts of those who have remained in the UK illegally was not known," the report said.
The Home Office said work was "already under way to address the recommendations relating to ticketing and escorting" and accepted all of the chief inspectors recommendations.

article The speed and range of decisions taken by King Salman since succeeding the late King Abdullah in January are breathtaking by Saudi standards and unprecedented.
In foreign policy, the kingdom's cautious approach in responding to regional crises and its preference for quiet diplomacy have been thrown out of the window by its decision to launch air strikes on Yemen.
Saudi Arabia is suddenly in the unusual role of taking the lead in what is widely perceived in the region as a military campaign backed by Sunni Arab states to block Shia Iranian expansionism.
But the changes inside the kingdom have been no less dramatic.
In January came the surprise appointment of Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef as deputy crown prince behind Crown Prince Muqrin.
Prince Mohammed was the first of the grandsons of Ibn Saud, the founder of the kingdom, to step onto the ladder leading to the throne.
At the same, King Salman chose his youngest son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to take over the defence portfolio.
These appointments were momentous enough, but they have now been followed by yet more startling changes.
Out goes Crown Prince Muqrin, with Mohammed bin Naif taking his place as heir to the throne, and Mohammed bin Salman becoming deputy crown prince.
Overnight, a country that has become accustomed to being ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s faces the prospect of a monarch-in-waiting in his 50s and his successor in his 30s.
The assumption for years had been that the younger generation would be eased slowly into line for the monarchy over a long period.
Indeed there was speculation that King Abdullah had selected Prince Muqrin to succeed King Salman precisely so that the former could supervise this delicate generational transition.
The new king, with the stroke of his pen, has done away with the need for such a role and Prince Muqrin has gone.
Another major change to the Saudi landscape is the replacement of the veteran foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, after four decades in the job.
His departure because of ill health is not surprising. But what was not expected was the appointment of a commoner to the post for the first time.
The new foreign minister is Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.
The likelihood is that he has been chosen precisely because of his knowledge of the workings of the world's sole superpower.
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are concerned at the prospect of an American-endorsed agreement between the international community and Iran over the nuclear issue that might lead to greater Iranian influence in the region.
For, as the unprecedented intervention in Yemen shows, this tops the concerns of Saudi leaders at present.
Among the latest decrees from King Salman was one awarding a month's bonus salary to all members of the military and security establishments.
At the same time, the rapid promotion of the two key figures in the Yemen campaign, the interior and defence ministers, sends a signal to anyone within the ruling family who might be questioning the wisdom of the military operation that the leadership is unwaveringly committed to the strategy it has chosen.
There may well be murmurs of dissent in private within the ruling family.
But they are more likely to come from senior princes who have been overlooked in recent appointments or from those who will regard the allocations of top positions as having been made too fast and without the chance for family consensus to be achieved.
As if anticipating this reaction, the king's decree making his youngest and relatively unknown son deputy crown prince stated that the promotion had the backing of the majority of the members of the family's Allegiance Council, which is designed to ensure a smooth succession process.
Saudi Arabia has witnessed a huge break with tradition and the conservative assumptions of the past no longer apply.
The king and his young advisers may well have concluded that the old ways are no longer suitable for the challenges that the kingdom faces at home and in the region.
Over recent days dozens of people have been arrested and accused of planning acts of terror in the name of Islamic State (IS).
Al-Qaeda is exploiting the chaos in Yemen to strengthen its base there for attacks on the kingdom, and Iran is playing a major role in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.
Then there is the continuing low price of oil at a time of colossal public expense, not least on the war in Yemen.
The CEO of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, Khaled al-Faleh, has been made company chairman in place of Petroleum Minister Ali Naimi, with the expectation that the latter will be replaced in the coming months, possibly by another son of the king, Deputy Oil Minister Abdel Aziz bin Salman.
Speculation is nothing new. But Saudis are having to come to terms with the startling reality that these days almost anything is possible.

article Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said differing policies should "raise alarm bells", especially after the death of Dalian Atkinson.
The former Aston Villa star died after being shot with a Taser in Telford.
A Press Association survey of UK police forces found a disjointed approach to the use of body-worn video (BWV).
PA found many forces had not completed a full roll-out of the use of the cameras, despite some top officers calling the equipment "vital".
A total of 28 of the country's 45 territorial forces responded to the survey.
The Home Office and National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) have said the use of the equipment, which is used to record incidents, is an "operational" decision for each force.
Former footballer Mr Atkinson, 48, went into cardiac arrest on his way to hospital after being shot following an altercation last month.
A criminal investigation is under way, but it emerged the officers involved were not equipped with BWV.
Mr Atkinson's family has called for all Taser-equipped police to be issued with bodycams as standard.
Fabian Atkinson, nephew of the former Ipswich, Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday star, said: "If they have a weapon and they're going to discharge that weapon, then they need a camera to record that."
The force involved in the Atkinson case, West Mercia, told PA it did not routinely use BWVs but was looking into the "best option" for the use of recording devices by officers on patrol.
Labour MP Mr Vaz called for "clear guidance" from national bodies on BWV use as well as transparency from forces.
"In the light of recent events, the Home Office must take action to ensure there is a far more co-ordinated national approach to the use of Tasers, which should be treated with the same respect as firearms," he said.
"It isn't right that crossing an arbitrary border within the UK would present you with completely separate policies on the use of potentially deadly weapons."
The College of Policing, the professional body for policing, said it was developing guidance "to increase consistency" on BWVs.
Richard Bennett, uniformed policing lead, said although forces made decisions independently, evidence from its trials suggested the bodycams could reduce the number of allegations against officers and evidence could help operational decisions.

article Bury and Rochdale are the only other teams to have stopped Town scoring in the league this season and it was an uninspiring clash at Highbury.
Ash Hunter latched on to David Ball's through ball to run one-on-one with James Shea but the goalkeeper pulled off a fine diving save to push the fierce strike to safety.
Ball just curled the ball round the left post from the dead-ball line while Bobby Grant's effort from 12 yards fizzed over the crossbar as Town ended the first half strongly.
It was a feistier second half and Wimbledon nearly took the lead against the run of play in the 72nd minute. A rare defensive mix-up from Cian Bolger and Ash Eastham saw the ball fall sweetly for Andy Barcham but his snap-shot flew over the bar.
That chance woke the visitors up and it was Neal Ardley's men who nearly snatched the points at the death as Barcham blasted just over.

article The Belgium-flagged vessel overturned off the Kent coast at about 23:00 GMT on Tuesday, the BBC understands.
One person - spotted clinging to the upturned hull of the boat - was rescued almost nine hours later, at 07:30 GMT.
Kaimes Beasley, of Dover Coastguard, said it would be possible to survive in the water for about 15 hours.
Two helicopters, including one from the Belgian search and rescue service, plus three lifeboats have been involved in the search.
The operation was called off late Wednesday afternoon due to fading light, Ramsgate lifeboat said.
Mr Beasley said: "Weather conditions overnight were relatively benign, winds were not terribly strong and the sea had been calm.
"Either way, it is still the North Sea in the winter and would have been very cold.
"In the southern North Sea, water temperature is about 9.5C and the air temperature less than that.
"There is a significant risk in terms of hypothermia."
The emergency services were first alerted at daylight when a passing boat saw the upturned vessel with one of the crew members standing on it.
He was able to tell them that two of his colleagues were unaccounted for.
Earlier, two divers and a doctor from Belgium were lowered on to a Ramsgate lifeboat to join the search for the two missing fishermen.
The operation is focussing on an area just up the coast from here in an area known as North Foreland.
That is where the lifeboats were searching for much of the morning and continuing into the afternoon.

article The Merseyside club are refusing to comment on the reasons behind the deal falling through but it is understood there has been an issue with the 27-year-old's medical.
Remy flew to the United States, where Liverpool are touring, on Monday.
The Reds' bid had activated a release clause in the contract of the player, who last year scored 14 goals on loan at Newcastle United.
They had planned to give Remy the number seven shirt and he had waited in the US for the best part of a week for the deal to be confirmed. The move will not be resurrected and Remy now faces the prospect of a return to QPR.
Remy was part of the France squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 Fifa World Cup in Brazil, appearing as a substitute against Ecuador and Germany.
He made 26 Premier League appearances for Newcastle last season but only played four of the final 11 games as he struggled with a calf injury.
Remy moved to Newcastle on loan after QPR's relegation from the Premier League in 2013.
Remy joined QPR during their last top-flight spell, making an £8m switch from French club Marseille in January 2013.
He scored six league goals for the west London club but could not stop them being relegated that season.
QPR regained their Premier League status at the first attempt by beating Derby in the Championship play-off final in May.

article The Guyanese left-hander, 41, made his Test debut in 1994 but was dropped after West Indies' home series against England in May 2015.
With 11,867 runs from 164 Tests, he retires as the Windies' second highest run-scorer, only 45 short of Brian Lara's record of 11,912.
He is also the seventh-highest Test run-scorer of all time.
Chanderpaul also played in 268 one-day internationals - where he scored another 8,778 runs - including five World Cups, as well as 22 Twenty20 internationals.
He was the International Cricket Council's top-ranked Test batsman for several spells, and also appeared in English county cricket for Durham, Lancashire, Warwickshire and Derbyshire.
While his unorthodox batting stance and obdurate, limpet-like adhesion to the crease saw him occasionally nicknamed "The Crab", Chanderpaul's record of 30 Test centuries at a career average in excess of 50 marks him down as one of the most prolific batsmen of his generation.

article People in Stanford near Folkestone have been sent letters telling them Asian tiger mosquito eggs had been discovered nearby.
Public Health England said no further evidence of the insect had been detected.
It said there was "currently no risk to public health in the UK".
Jolyon Medlock, head of medical entomology at Public Health England (PHE), said: "We regularly monitor mosquito species and look for any which are new to the UK.
"Enhanced monitoring of the area was implemented and no further evidence of this mosquito has so far been found.
"As a precaution we advised the local authority to use insecticide as a means of control."
PHE confirmed the spraying of insecticide had been fully completed at the site.
The Zika infection has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.
Public Health England said it would continue to monitor the situation closely.
Two years ago Public Health England set up traps at motorway service stations to monitor this species of mosquito over fears the insects could enter the UK on lorries from Europe. None was found.

article Five teenage suspects were arrested over an alleged plot to carry out an attack at a World War One centenary event.
The families of two of the men have also alleged that officers used excessive force in Saturday's raids.
Police said the men were planning to target officers during an Anzac memorial event in Melbourne.
An 18-year-old, Sevdet Besim, has been charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act.
Two men remain in custody. The other three have been released but police have said that one man is expected to be charged on weapons offences.
One of the suspects has been detained under a preventative detention order that allows him to be held for 14 days if necessary.
Local media report that it is the first time the order has been used in the state of Victoria.
Nearly 200 officers took part in the counter-terrorism operation.
A family member of one of the detained men told ABC News on Sunday that his family had been traumatised by the experience.
Acting Assistant Commissioner Tim Cartwright said police would investigate the complaints, but he added that the risks were carried out "in high-risk situations".
"We believe at least some of these people will be armed and will have a strong motivation to hurt police," ABC News quoted him as saying.
"I'm not surprised there are some minor injuries as a result."
Police said that the men were "associates" of Abdul Numan Haider, a teenager shot dead in September after he stabbed two officers.
Anzac Day is an annual day of remembrance for servicemen and women from Australia and New Zealand. A series of events are planned for next week to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the landings at Gallipoli, Turkey.
Australia raised its threat level to high last September and has since carried out a series of counter-terrorism raids.

article In a quiet corner of the garden is a bench bearing a plaque which reads: "Daniel. Our friend. Missed but not forgotten".
It's an apt epitaph for a child described as "invisible" in the serious case review.
There were dozens of missed opportunities to intervene in his short but chaotic life, but only one or two key moments where the accumulation of evidence might have triggered action.
A key theme to this and many other high profile serious case reviews is that critical information wasn't adequately shared between professionals.
The 76-page report portrays a system where staff are overworked and the system repeatedly lets individuals, like Daniel, down.
None of the agencies involved - the police, teachers, doctors, nurses and social workers  - ever directly asked him about his extreme weight loss, bruises and other injuries.
The report attempts to explain why.
It says Daniel was a "solemn" and withdrawn little boy who spoke very little English. There was a scarcity of interpreters, and Daniel's mother, Magdalena Luczak, was "controlling" and "intimidating".
Daniel, she said, had a medical condition which accounted for his weight loss. The cuts and bruises were explained away as typical childhood injuries. When he broke a bone, the explanation was believable - he'd fallen off his bike.
The report's author, Ron Lock, has written 11 other serious case reviews. He says child protection professionals were often unprepared to "think the unthinkable" and were often too willing to follow the "rule of optimism".
In this case it meant, despite clear signs to the contrary, no-one was willing to consider that Daniel was being subjected to prolonged and horrific abuse.
There were exceptions. A police officer insisted that the case be referred on after one of many visits to a call about domestic violence.
Teachers at Little Heath Primary School were worried enough to report Daniel's behaviour and involve the family GP and a paediatrician, but the referrals never got beyond that.
Martin Reeves, chief executive of Coventry City Council, points out that there haven't been any other cases like this in the city and believes that may have contributed to the failure to recognise the severity of the case.
He also said more would be done to ensure agencies shared vital information about cases. He promised that lessons had already been learned.
However, there have been other high profile cases nearby like Khyra Ishaq in Birmingham and Ryan Lovell-Hancox in Wolverhampton, and nationally significant ones like that of Baby P.
Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the charity Action For Children, said: "The same lessons that need to be learnt from cases like Daniel's are coming up time and time again.
"Hundreds of vulnerable children at risk of dying and serious harm are falling through the cracks of a creaking child protection system."
There have been calls for a wide-scale reform of the child protection system.
One model is being employed in a handful of areas across the country. Different agencies sit alongside each other in what are known as Multi Agency Safeguarding Hubs.
The nearest to Coventry is jointly run by Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent. There are frequent briefings and conversations about cases and if more than one agency has a concern, intervention will follow. Professionals who were reluctant to share information have become used to working in a more collegiate way.
The next serious case review into a child's death will focus on Keanu Williams, the two-year-old boy beaten to death by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth in Birmingham in 2011.
It's expected to be published in a matter of weeks. If the same failings are found to have taken place again, the clamour for a wholesale reform of child protection is likely to grow.

article The Spanish giants have made a world-record £86m bid for Bale but Spurs, who have been linked with Roma's Erik Lamela, say no deal has been agreed.
Spurs missed out on Brazil midfielder Willian, who joined Chelsea.
And they are happy to wait over Bale's sale as it may trigger a series of deals which end up boosting rivals.
Arsenal, for instance, have been linked with Real pair Karim Benzema and Angel Di Maria, and any potential deals for them may be affected by what happens with Bale.
The transfer window closes at 23:00 BST on 2 September.
Spurs have already missed out on former Anzhi Makhachkala attacker Willian, who joined Chelsea for £30m after he had already completed a medical at Tottenham.
Andre Villas-Boas's side have been linked with Argentine forward Lamela, 21, and Chelsea's Juan Mata, although Blues boss Jose Mourinho says the Spanish playmaker is not for sale, despite leaving him out of the side that drew 0-0 with Manchester United on Monday.
In addition to Real's offer for Bale, Tottenham have also received a separate bid for the Welshman. The identity of that club is not known but Manchester United have been linked with the player this summer.
Meanwhile, Bale failed to report for training on Tuesday following a club-authorised break in Marbella. No reason has been given for his no-show.
Real Madrid have made two different offers for Bale and are waiting to see whether Tottenham accept either one.
It is believed that a stage, nicknamed the "Bale Box", has been erected at their Bernabeu ground to unveil Bale to the Spanish club's fans.
Real Madrid's next home game will be on Sunday against Athletic Bilbao, the day before the end of the transfer window.
Bale, who joined Spurs in a £10m deal from Southampton in 2007, was named player of the year by both the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Writers last season after scoring 26 goals for the White Hart Lane side.
Madrid have already spent in excess of £50m this summer, bringing in Spanish midfielders Asier Illarramendi from Real Sociedad and Malaga's Isco for £34m and £23m respectively.

article Border Collie Jasper vanished when out for a walk up Scafell Pike in the Lake District with his owner Adam Nolan.
A mountain rescue team, helicopter, police and dog lovers searched for him and he was found on Thursday.
A JustGiving page set up by Mr Nolan to raise money for the rescue team had raised more than Â£25,000 by 19:00 GMT.
Jasper was last seen at about 14:00 on Sunday at Cam Spout Crag below Scafell Pike.
The day out was "nothing out of the blue" and Jasper was used to walking and running on the fells, his owner said.
Distraught by his disappearance, Mr Nolan, from Cleator Moor, took to social media for help to find his four-legged friend, with the #FindJasper campaign going viral.
On Wednesday, after a possible sighting in Seascale, Mr Nolan vowed he would not stop searching until Jasper was "home and in front of the fire".
The local community got behind the search for Jasper and Wasdale Mountain Rescue found him in the early hours of Thursday.
Mr Nolan said on Facebook: "I'm over the moon to announce the safe return of my best friend Jasper.
"This morning Geoff Horky [from the rescue team] ascended Scafell Pike in response to the information received yesterday regarding the sighting of Jasper Near the Scafell Pike summit.
"Geoff found Jasper at 2.00am in very good condition. The Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team were then alerted and began the rescue operation. Upon hearing the news I followed the Wasdale Mountain Rescue team to Lingmell Col were I was united with Jasper.
"Naturally, there are numerous individuals who I would like to thank, but at the moment I would say a huge thank you to Geoff and the Wasdale Mountain Rescue Team for their heroic efforts this morning."
A spokesman for Wasdale Mountain Rescue said: "The team are pleased to announce that we have been involved in the successful rescue of Jasper.
"The team responded and recovered Jasper back to the valley to meet Adam."

article The Remain campaign claimed that the Kremlin was secretly backing a Brexit to weaken the European Union. In the words of Prime Minister David Cameron, President Vladimir Putin "might be happy" if Britain left the EU.
So, is he? Is the Kremlin leader loving a Brexit?
Not publicly, at least.
On Friday, Mr Putin told journalists the referendum result brought "positives and negatives".  He spoke about the negatives, including the unsettling effect on financial markets.
But what are the "positives"? What does Russia gain from a Brexit? My thoughts:
The UK and EU have been plunged into economic uncertainty. What will happen? Will the UK break apart? Will other EU member states push to leave?
In the coming weeks, expect Russian state media to contrast post-referendum upheaval and uncertainty abroad with a picture of "stability" back home and images of a "strong" President Putin at the helm.
Ahead of parliamentary elections later this year, such coverage could boost the party of power, United Russia, and the president himself. Good for the ratings!
The EU imposed sanctions on Russia because of Moscow's intervention in Ukraine. Now, with Brexit, the EU is under huge pressure. As expected, Russian schadenfreude - gloating over another's woes - is in plentiful supply.
"It's no joke. The pound is the new rouble," commented one state TV presenter on Friday as sterling was on the slide.
Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the upper house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, admitted to Life TV: "Considering our difficult relations with the EU, there is a temptation to gloat over the EU's misfortunes."
But Mr Kosachev himself resisted the temptation. He pointed out that the EU remains Russia's largest trading partner.
"If the EU falls apart at the seams," he warned, "this will affect our trade relations".
Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin believes Russia wins from Brexit.
"Without the UK in the EU, there will no longer be anyone so zealously standing up for sanctions against us," he tweeted.
"Of all EU states, Britain has been the most aggressive towards Russia," writes political analyst Alexei Mukhin in the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets. "It has always criticised us and tried to harm us economically, financially and politically. Brexit will make the European Union more friendly towards Russia."
Wishful thinking, perhaps. The UK has not been the only EU state taking a hard line with Russia. Poland, Sweden and the Baltic states have been too.
There is currently no love lost between Number 10 Downing Street and the Kremlin. David Cameron said Vladimir Putin backed a Brexit. Mr Putin accused David Cameron of organising the EU referendum "to blackmail Europe".
Following Mr Cameron's resignation, Mr Putin's spokesman said he hoped that "in the new reality, the understanding of a necessity to build good relations with our country will prevail". (In other words, "let's hope the new PM likes us more".)
Leading Brexiteers have called for better relations with Russia. Six months ago, Boris Johnson urged Britain to work more closely with Russia in fighting so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He concluded: "It is just not true that whatever is good for Putin must automatically be bad for the West".
The Kremlin will have taken note.

They will also be able to wear trousers instead of skirts to school, as long as they are white. This brings Christian schools into line with the uniform policy at state schools.
Large swathes of northern Kenya have received very little government support over the decades and have grown to depend on schools and hospitals run by Christian missionaries.
In counties like Garissa, Mandera and Lodwar, the best-performing schools were run by Christian missionaries. Rules included studying Christianity and, at Catholic schools, attending Mass together at daybreak. The challenge came as Muslim students joined these schools.
One Muslim parent told me that at first, she had accepted the rules because of the school's great results. She wanted her daughter to go to university. But with time, she found the school to be in conflict with her family's religion. Teachers suspended her daughter rather than allow her to pray in the Islamic way.
Eventually this mother became one of the parents who challenged the school's uniform policy, leading to Friday's ruling. She said: "This decision is very good not for my daughter alone but for many students like her in north-eastern Kenya where practically the best schools are run by Catholic nuns."
Female students at St Paul's Kiwanjani Day Secondary School in Isiolo County had been banned from wearing a hijab and white trousers in addition to their uniform.
Local authorities ordered that Muslim girls must be allowed to wear hijabs and the Methodist Church challenged their directive in court. But three judges agreed with the local authorities.
The judges said students are "bearers and exercisers of the full guarantees in our bill of rights and they are no less entitled to those rights by reason only of being within school gates".
Local media report that the court said the hijab ban discriminated against Muslim girls "in so far as it prohibits and prevents them from manifesting their religion".
The case may have knock-on effects for other minorities, such as the Christian sect the Akorino, who wear turbans.
One father, John Kamau, told the BBC the ruling had come too late for his son, who was suspended from four different schools for breaking the rules.
"The law is good," he said, "but it cannot bring back wasted opportunities and life lost because school principals were overruling the Kenyan constitution and intimidating our children."

article Before going to the Kashmir Valley that was devastated by floods last month, Mr Modi made a brief visit to the Siachen glacier.
The area is claimed by both India and Pakistan, which each have thousands of troops stationed there.
"The BJP... is hoping to cash in on the anger of the people against Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's patchy rehabilitation of the seven lakh [700,000] people displaced by the September floods," writes the Deccan Chronicle, referring to upcoming state elections in Jammu and Kashmir.
But it adds that the prime minister had tried "to kill two birds, domestic and international, with one stone".
With "Mission Kashmir", India's leader also wanted to tell Pakistan "that the status of Jammu and Kashmir is non-negotiable", the daily concludes.
The New Indian Express also thinks that Mr Modi's trip "was fraught with political significance that goes beyond the BJP's electoral imperatives".
"Having given the armed forces full operational freedom to respond to the escalation of ceasefire violations by Pakistan forces, Modi wants to give a clear message that the trust gap between the country's civilian authority and the armed forces that lurked during the UPA [Congress-led United Progressive Alliance] dispensation no longer exists."
Commenting on the $120 million aid package announced for the state, the daily argues that the prime minister "has offered a road map for reconstruction of the devastated region" that can "be effective in bringing Jammu and Kashmir into the mainstream of the country's growth story".
The ruling parties in the state, the National Conference and its coalition partner Congress, have criticised the assistance as a "big let down", arguing that it "doesn't go far enough".
Media report that the authorities have filed a criminal case against the school in Bangalore where a three-year-old nursery student was allegedly raped earlier this week.
Hindustan Times says that no arrests have been made yet, but that three staff members were supposedly picked up by the police for questioning.
The Deccan Chronicle quotes reports as saying that a school attendant has been detained.
The incident has led to angry protests in Bangalore. It happened just three months after a six-year-old girl was raped at another private school in the city.

article But such is the nostalgia and interest in the Star Wars universe, it might be worth checking whether you have any hidden away in your attic.
A collection of rare figures has just been snapped up for an eye-watering £350,000 at an auction on Teesside.
A boxed figure of bounty hunter Boba Fett was the most expensive item, fetching £26,000, while a prototype of the same character went for £18,000.
According to Louise Harker from Teesside-based auctioneers Vectis, the hundreds of figures had been collected by a French family over 40 years.
"The owners have a museum in France and collect all sorts of toys," she said.
"A lot of the items, such as the boxed Boba Fett figure, were European in origin and so not readily available in Britain.
"Interest is stronger than ever and the new batch of films is introducing a new audience."
Other figures in the auction, which had almost 800 lots, included a vintage Yoda, Luke Skywalker and Jawa.

article The Blues' 2-1 defeat by promotion-chasing Brighton at St Andrew's left them 11 points off the top six with seven matches to play.
"I don't want this season to fizzle out," Rowett, 42, told BBC WM 95.6.
"We need to win some games for our pride, our fans and our momentum - and that's going to be our main focus."
Ninth-placed Birmingham were only a point outside the play-off places at the start of March but a run of five games without a win, including three defeats, has all but ended their chances of going up.
"It's not over in terms of winning games of football but if I said we've still got a chance of getting in the play-offs people would think I'm a little bit barmy and talking rubbish," Rowett said.
"Logically, our opportunity's gone but we're in a really good position in terms of the league. Last season we didn't have much to play for and won the last three games to climb to 10th."
Although making the top six is no longer a realistic aim, Rowett says he is not planning to use the remaining seven games to experiment with different systems, including pairing Kyle Lafferty and Clayton Donaldson up front together.
"Whenever we've played two strikers, there's been too much space on the pitch and we've conceded loads of goals," he said.
"There's been a real clamour to change things and formations, but you have to say 4-2-3-1 has won us most games and got us into the position we're in.
"I'm not saying we shouldn't be flexible or experiment, it's just that when we do we seem to get worse."

article Kenya said sprint coach John Anzrah "presented himself as an athlete" and "even signed the documents" for the doping test.
"We cannot tolerate such behaviour," said Kip Keino, chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya.
Anzrah is the second Kenyan official to be sent home over doping issues after track and field manager Michael Rotich.
Rotich was dismissed following allegations that he was prepared to warn coaches about drugs tests in return for £10,000.
Keino said Kenya's Olympic body had not facilitated Anzrah's travel to Brazil, adding: "We don't even know how he came here."
It was not clear which athlete Anzrah was pretending to be.
However, a senior Athletics Kenya source said he had spoken to the athlete, who claims Anzrah used his accreditation purely to obtain free meals from the athletes' village.
"When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was the athlete and that he was lined up for testing," added the source.
"The coach, for fear of being exposed or discovered, did not explain to the anti-doping guy that he is actually not the athlete. Hence he played along and went for the test."

article Mr Cowen faced further questions on Wednesday at the inquiry into the causes of the Irish banking crash in 2008.
He said he took responsibility for his role as leader of the country in the downturn.
But Mr Cowen said his policies while in power were "plausible"
He said the Irish government's decisions were stress-tested against threats, but there was a "clear misjudgment of the risks and potential impacts".
Mr Cowen also said his approach was "broadly shared" even by political opponents.
He said at the time the public was questioning if spending on improved services and other investments was happening quickly enough.
Mr Cowen said if his government had spent less during the boom, the country would not have suffered as severely from the late 2000s.
However, he said that would have also meant fewer jobs and lower growth before the crash, which "would have in turn reduced our ability to come out of recession as quickly as we have".
"One way or the other the impact of the financial crisis has made the serious adjustment in the public finances which could not have been avoided in any event," he said.
Mr Cowen said that a bank guarantee was a safer option than nationalising Anglo Irish Bank which he said would amount to an open-ended guarantee.
He denied that he had overruled the then finance minister Brian Lenihan, who had favoured immediate nationalisation.
"I did not think nationalisation should be a first course and I said so," he said.
Mr Cowen said the two men had weighed up their options privately in his personal office, and that he had assured Mr Lenihan that Anglo could be nationalised if necessary some time in the future.
He said there was a consensus that Anglo could not be allowed to fail as it would cause a run on other banks and a meltdown of the entire system.
"It was Wall Street 1929 stuff," he said.
Mr Cowen apologised that there was no accurate and full note of the meeting, which, he said, would have been helpful.
He again denied that he spoke about banking during a golfing and dinner meeting at Druids Glen golf club with three serving or former Anglo figures, including chairman Sean FitzPatrick, just two months beforehand.
During his first appearance before the inquiry last week, Mr Cowen apologised for the "hardship and distress" caused to Irish people by austerity policies.
However, he said the policies were "necessary" during the banking crisis.
The Republic of Ireland's banking sector had to be almost entirely nationalised when the bursting of a property price bubble coincided with a global financial downturn in 2008.
However, two years after issuing the blanket guarantee to prevent a run on Irish banks, Mr Cowen's government was forced to concede the banks' debts were too big and had to seek an international bailout.
Mr Cowen stepped down as taoiseach eight weeks after requesting a financial rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU).
The following month, his Fianna FÃ¡il party suffered its worst ever defeat in a general election since the foundation of the state.
However, by December 2013, and after years of tough and unpopular austerity measures, the Republic of Ireland become the first eurozone nation to exit the bailout programme.
The causes of the banking crisis are being investigated by an Irish parliamentary committee at Leinster House in Dublin.

article Richard Walsh, 43, was awaiting trial accused of attempting to murder two schoolboys in Hampshire when he was found hanged in his cell.
An inquest jury found he should have been detained in hospital rather than held in Belmarsh Prison.
Southern Health NHS Trust said it would ensure better "sharing of information".
On 27 September a verdict of suicide, contributed to by neglect, was recorded at the inquest into Mr Walsh's death.
Mr Walsh was held at Waterlooville police station following the stabbing of two boys, aged 12 and 13, in Southleigh Road in Havant on 26 June last year.
Southwark Coroner's Court heard he was "saying strange things", became "delusional", was "obsessed with a woman police officer", and hid under a blanket when questioned.
He was assessed by two independent psychiatrists and a mental health professional approved by Hampshire County Council, but was not sectioned.
The inquest jury said there had been "gross failures of medical care" as they failed to interrogate the custody record and the custody officer and did not speak to Mr Walsh's family or GP.
"Had they done, then Mr Walsh would have been detained in a hospital.
"It is more likely than not... that if Mr Walsh had been detained in a hospital... he would not have killed himself," the jury found.
Mr Walsh was found hanged on 19 July 2015, the day before he was due to appear at Portsmouth Crown Court.
Following the ruling, Southern Health's medical director Dr Lesley Stevens said: "We fully accept the jury's findings and are acting quickly to improve assessments and communication between health organisations and the criminal justice system."
The trust said it would delay assessments of detainees if custody logs were not available and would implement "clear and robust processes" for sharing information between clinical teams in the custody and prison services.
A Prison Service spokesman said it had already taken action following a Prisons and Probation Ombudsman investigation.
"We will now carefully consider the inquest findings to help ensure such incidents are not repeated," he said.
Hampshire County Council said it would "carefully consider the full findings".

"I've been honoured to have led the LTA over the last three years," he said.
"I am hugely proud of the foundations the team at the LTA have laid in order to turn participation in Britain's beloved sport around. "
He added: "It's an exciting time for tennis in this country and I look forward to the next six months, maintaining the momentum we've built in our continued mission to get more people playing tennis, more often."
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
Three and a half years in a role such as this is often not long enough to leave much of a mark, but after an uncertain start, Michael Downey has left his imprint on British tennis.
The performance department was allowed to remain in a state of flux for far too long, but with Simon Timson now at the helm, the LTA has a man who in the same role at UK Sport oversaw Britain's stunningly successful Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games.
There has been a rise in the number of people playing tennis under Downey's watch and he certainly brought a phenomenal work ethic with him. Given the salary on offer and a potentially bright future for the sport, there is sure to be a lot of interest in succeeding him.

article Currently women can serve on the front line, but not where the primary aim is to "close with and kill the enemy".
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said head of the Army Sir Peter Wall would report back by the end of the year.
Mr Hammond said he wanted to send a signal that the military is open "to all who can meet the... standards."
Currently women are not permitted to serve in the infantry or armoured corps where they could be involved in close combat.
Mr Hammond said the armed forces still had a "macho image", the "last bastion of male chauvinism. The reality is very different".
"I think that at a time when the Americans, the Australians, the Canadians, even the French - the Israelis of course for years - have women in their combat arms, this is something we have to look at again," he said.

'Times have changed' on women troops
He said there would be no "compromise" on fitness requirements, highlighting the fact that engineers searching for explosive devices in Afghanistan had to carry loads of 63kg (10 stone) in a combat zones.
BBC defence correspondent, Jonathan Beale, said government sources had stressed it was not a change of policy.
The Ministry of Defence is required under European law to review its policy every eight years.
Major Judith Webb, who retired from the Army in 1986, is opposed to women being allowed to take close combat roles.
"We have to accept that we are different physiologically," she said.
"We don't have the same upper-body strength."
Maj Webb said it was "nonsense" to suggest there could be less-demanding tests for women entering combat roles, and reducing standards "across the board" would reduce the effectiveness of the Army.
She said the "occasional woman" might meet standards for male soldiers, but said that would lead to calls for more women to follow - which could result in standards being lowered to promote equality.
Women had proved themselves in a variety of roles and there should be more women in senior ranks, she added.

Brigadier Nicky Moffat, the highest-ranking woman in the British army until her retirement in 2012, said the arguments against women in combat roles were the "same that used to be trotted out to exclude women from the wider range of roles in which they are now allowed to serve".
"There would be of course fewer women than men that will want to join and that will be able to meet the necessarily demanding physical standards, that mustn't be lowered," she said.
She said a 2010 review - and the example of the UK's female Olympians - showed there were women with the necessary "psychological and physical" strengths for combat roles.
Labour MP Gisela Stuart, a member of the Defence Select Committee, said: "Increasingly, we are accepting that certain jobs require certain abilities and physical aptitude, and if you meet those requirements you should be able to do the job whether you are a man or a woman."
General Sir Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff, said it was "now sensible" to review the Army's position on women in combat roles.
But his predecessor as head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, said keeping women out of combat roles was a "point of principle".
"To be in a unit that is given orders to attack a hill, to attack a town, to attack a village, that is a role not for women," he said.
There are almost 16,000 women serving in the combined services, 9.9% of all personnel, according to the latest statistics.
The Army has more than 8,000 serving women, 8.7% of the total force, with almost 12% of officer ranks filled by female personnel.
By comparison, women make up 9% of the Royal Navy and 13.8% of the Royal Air Force.
The 2010 review of women in the Army raised concerns that having men and women in small units for months at a time could undermine "team cohesion".
Changes to the armed forces, also in 2010, meant women were able to take on the role as clearance divers, while in December 2011, it was announced that women would be able to serve on submarines.
Last week, three women became the first female submariners in the 110-year history of the Submarine Service.
The latest review has been welcomed by Labour's shadow defence secretary, Vernon Coaker, who said the armed forces "should give the same opportunities to women as it does to men and this move will hopefully ensure that becomes the case".

article The former Sheffield United goalkeeper pushed Kieran Agard's spot-kick onto the crossbar moments after the Dons had brought themselves level through Ryan Colclough.
Phil Parkinson's side took a seventh-minute lead when Jay Spearing's corner was headed back at the far post by Jamie Proctor and Mark Beevers swept home from close range.
Wanderers dominated the half and should have doubled their advantage when David Wheater headed over from close range.
Agard missed a chance to open his account for the season when he failed to get a touch on Dean Bowditch's low cross, but the Dons were level nine minutes after the restart when Colclough slotted home at the second attempt following a save from Howard.
Agard then won a penalty after being pulled down by Lewis Buxton, only to be frustrated by a magnificent stop from Howard.
Almost immediately Bolton had a good claim for a penalty of their own turned down when Proctor appeared to be fouled in mid-air by Joe Walsh.
The home side turned the screw and Newcastle loanee Sammy Ameobi had two late efforts kept out of the net by some excellent goalkeeping by David Martin and some frantic defending.

The pair's history of animosity with Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain's La Liga meant their first Premier League meeting since assuming control on either side of Manchester provided a colourful backdrop to the build-up to this derby.
And when the action got under way on the field, it was City who put a marker down and put Manchester United in their place with a peerless first 40 minutes followed by resilience to maintain their 100% start to the season.
This was always going to be much more than the Manchester derby - this was as much about Mourinho against Guardiola on the Premier League stage, fighting for supremacy in Manchester.
And this was Spaniard Guardiola's day on every level as City claimed the win and his celebrated methods were on show for all to see at Old Trafford, the fiercest enemy territory.
Mourinho was a chastened figure post-match, reduced to blaming referee Mark Clattenburg for not awarding two second half penalties for what he felt was City keeper Claudio Bravo's foul on Wayne Rooney and Nicolas Otamendi's handball.
It was an act of straw-clutching, although the Portuguese fully accepted City's first-half superiority when he admitted he and his players got it wrong.

The bottom line is United were second best and this was something of a cold shower for the over-excitement of some who believed 'The Special One' could apply an instant fix to the faults of the past three seasons under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.
Mourinho's decision to play Henrikh Mkhitaryan on the right in his first start since his £25m summer move from Borussia Dortmund was a dismal failure - and he admitted some of his players struggled to cope with "the dimension of the game".
The Armenia captain was removed at half-time in a reshuffle that also saw Jesse Lingard taken off, Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera sent on, and the completely anonymous £89m midfield man Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini pushed forward, with Wayne Rooney shunted out to the right.
In other words - Mourinho's selection went wrong.
He said: "I had two or three players in the first half that, if I know what is going to happen, I don't play them. This is football, though, and sometimes players disappoint managers.
"It's my fault because I'm the manager and it's always my fault because it's my choice."
Guardiola was bold enough to play Kelechi Iheanacho as replacement for the suspended Sergio Aguero and the 19-year-old responded with his ninth goal from just 13 shots on target in the Premier League.
And his introduction of Fernando for the youngster after 53 minutes demonstrated a pragmatism that is often overlooked amid Guardiola's purist instincts. He was prepared to use a shield when required.
City were also prepared to work for their success, running a total of 119.63km in comparison to United's 111.34km. Guardiola demands the full package from his players.
It was not all perfect as his selection of the uncertain Claudio Bravo in goal ran a fine line with failure - but all's well that ends well.
The embraces with long-time foe Mourinho at the start and finish were cordial enough - and if Guardiola did get around to having that glass of wine in the Old Trafford manager's office when his media duties were completed it would have tasted sweet.
Manchester City made their intentions clear when they lured the most coveted man in management to Etihad Stadium - and Guardiola's team have wasted no time in making big statements of their own.
The Catalan has opened up with four straight Premier League wins, this victory at Old Trafford marking them out as the team to beat in the title race this season.
It is, of course, early days but City's ability to win with key players either suspended, injured or working their way to full fitness means a significant marker was put down in this derby win.
It was a win achieved without the banned Aguero and without influential captain Vincent Kompany who is nearing a return, as is summer signing Ilkay Gundogan, who was also absent.
Leroy Sane, the £37m summer signing from Schalke, made a lively appearance as a substitute here and will be a formidable force when fully fit.
John Stones was outstanding when United's second-half siege came, demonstrating why Guardiola was satisfied to spend £47.5m on the young England defender to bring him from Everton.
Kevin de Bruyne was also a key figure, scoring one goal and being involved in the other. He has been directly involved in 32 goals in 46 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 17 and assisting in 15.
And when Guardiola studies the statistics, an 81.8% passing success rate will please even this perfectionist, who expressed his satisfaction with this two-dimensional City display - glorious, clinical football in the first half and solid resilience in the second.
City restricted United to their fourth lowest home possession share in the Premier League since the 2003-04 season, just 39.9%
Manchester City's squad looked short of inspiration and motivation in the understated presence of Manuel Pellegrini last season - this problem looks to have been cured already by Guardiola.
It has been an impressive start. Those with Premier League title aspirations now know what they have to beat.

Pep Guardiola has invested a lot of faith in Claudio Bravo after showing England goalkeeper Joe Hart the door and paying £17m to bring the 33-year-old Chile international from Barcelona.
It was, therefore, no surprise to hear Guardiola mounting a passionate defence of his man despite a performance that left City and their supporters living on their nerves.
In Bravo's defence, he has barely had any training sessions with his new team-mates and a debut at Old Trafford is always a daunting introduction.
Guardiola's backing for his keeper, while understandable, was at odds with a display that occasionally threatened to spread panic in City's ranks.
He was hesitant and occasionally too slow to clear with the ball at his feet and once he came from his line to claim a first-half free-kick, Bravo had to catch it. He did not, allowing Zlatan Ibrahimovic to score and give United hope.
Guardiola praised Bravo's willingness to take responsibility and is happy for his keeper to take a high-risk approach in exchange for the rewards he believes it brings.
It is too early to say whether Bravo will be an upgrade on the banished Hart but those who believe England's first-choice keeper has been sent into exile too soon will not have had their worries eased by this performance.
They will have to trust Guardiola's judgement - and he has not got anything wrong so far.
While Mourinho bemoaned those players who struggled to cope with the unique demands of the Manchester derby, he had no such complaints about Marcus Rashford.
Mourinho said the 18-year-old looked like he was "playing against Salford City under-18s" in a second half performance that combined pace and a fearless approach - and almost an equaliser only for an offside Zlatan Ibrahimovic to get a touch on his goal-bound shot.
The question will continue and the clamour will grow for Rashford to start in an area of Mourinho's squad that is starting to look over-crowded.
Rashford was the player who put City on the back foot with his speed. It will be one of Mourinho's most urgent tasks to integrate this brilliant young talent into his team.
It then begs further questions, with Ibrahimovic seemingly untouchable as the main man, about where Rooney fits in and how Mourinho can shuffle his resources to maximise the potential of Rashford, Antony Martial, Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata.
Ibrahimovic had all of United's three shots on target as well as four of their six off target, so it is likely to a case of who plays with the 34-year-old Swede.
Rashford, on this showing, cannot be denied his starting place for much longer.

article The conceptual holiday home in Wrabness, Essex, which is yet to be finished, has been built at the end of a narrow cul-de-sac.
Residents say motorists have flocked to the area and caused traffic problems on narrow roads near the site.
Essex Highways has agreed to carry out works to relieve the situation.
One resident, who asked not be named, said the issues had been "significant" and people living in the area were bracing themselves for the warmer months when even more visitors were expected.
Wrabness Parish Council said: "Residents have been beset by problems such as access and egress to their properties, conflicting vehicle movements, inconsiderate parking and awkward manoeuvring."
As well as new signs and road markings, talks will be held with the operator of the railway station car park to see whether it could be used by visitors to the Grayson Perry house.
Carlo Guglielmi, Essex County Council's member for Tendring Rural West, said: "It is an iconic thing and it is beautiful to have it here in Tendring. But we've always had concerns about access.
"The enhancement measures agreed will greatly improve Wrabness's residents everyday life."
The 54-year-old artist designed the building, also known as Julie's House, along with FAT architecture in homage to the "single mums in Dagenham, hairdressers in Colchester, and the landscape and history of Essex".
Mr Perry is yet to comment on the matter.

article These strains seem to boost populations of natural pest-controlling predators, and this effect spills over to non-transgenic crops, the research found.
Details of the work by a Chinese-French team  
          appear in the journal Nature
.
But one group critical of GM planting described the effect as a spillover "problem", not a "benefit".
Scientists investigated a modified version of cotton grown in China that generates a bacterial insecticide.
The strain has led to a reduction in the use of insecticide to control a major pest, the cotton bollworm.
After the GM cotton was introduced, researchers saw a marked increase in numbers of pest predators such as ladybirds, lacewings and spiders.
At the same time, populations of crop-damaging aphids fell.
The predatory insects also controlled pests in neighbouring fields of non-GM maize, soybean and peanut crops, said the team led by Dr Kongming Wu from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing.
Commenting on the study, Professor Guy Poppy from the University of Southampton, UK, said: "Global food security will require us to sustainably intensify agriculture. Opponents of GM have argued this can't be done through biotechnology, whereas this research challenges this view and demonstrates the wider benefits of using GM plants.
"By reducing the need for insecticides against caterpillars, insect biodiversity is increased and this is shown to have added benefits outside of the GM crop field."
Emma Hockridge, head of policy at the Soil Association, the British campaign group that advocates organic farming, said: "Encouraging predator insects is crucial to managing crop pests sustainably - indeed, that's how organic farmers avoid pesticides, using natural processes to encourage beneficial predators.
"This study finds that Bt cotton is a better habitat for such predators than cotton that has been sprayed with pesticides.
"What it doesn't cover is other recent research in China that has discovered increased insect resistance and increased numbers of pests developing in and around these GM cotton crops."
Previous research by Dr Wu showed that one crop pest - the mirid bug - had  
          boomed since the introduction of Bt Cotton
, as it filled the gap left by other cotton pests. This had driven farmers back to using pesticides.
Professor John Pickett from Rothamsted Research, UK, commented: "Many, including distinguished scientists, have looked for associated problems as the technology has been commercially developed throughout the world and, of course, we should always exercise caution in introducing new technologies.
"However, use of GM-based Bt resistance to pest insects would not have advanced so dramatically without advantages, not least a reduction in use of insecticides against the target lepidopterous insect larvae."

article The singer from The Saturdays said she was "so excited" to be a contestant in the dancing competition.
She told Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1's breakfast show she always watched the show with her family and added that she "can't wait to get into the sequins".
The new series starts on BBC One next month.
King said: "I'm a huge fan of Strictly Come Dancing so I can't actually believe I'm lucky enough to be taking part in it this year! I'm literally so excited to learn Latin and ballroom dancing, and of course I can't wait to get into the sequins too!
"It's going to be a lot of hard work but I'm ready for the challenge."
The 30-year-old told Grimmie it had been tough to keep news of her involvement a secret.
She had previously only told her parents and bandmate Frankie Bridge, who made it to the final of Strictly three years ago.
King said: "It's something that I always said I wanted to do. I've always watched it with my family and it looks so fun.
"I'm going to be giving it my all. I'm very competitive so watch out, other contestants, I'm taking you down!"
She added that she would be up for having a "cheeky spray tan" and wearing sparkles, saying it was a chance to be a "princess".
King said she was starting training soon - and that she hoped she would not be voted out in the first week.
She also said she was a huge Britney Spears fan and would love to dance to her music on the show.
This year's contestants have all been given code names relating to classical Greece, with King's being Clio, one of the nine muses.

The band, who got back together for a pair of reunion shows in the park six years ago, join Taylor Swift, Kylie and The Who on the bill.
Speaking at a news conference in a London Chinatown restaurant, frontman Damon Albarn joked: "I love it because I can cycle to work".
They'll be the only band ever to play Hyde Park four times after this performance.
Bassist Alex James says that "since we made our last record as a four-piece we have probably only done 20 gigs.
"So for me every time we play together it feels special but in order to keep doing it we need something news to do."
Blur are also working on their first studio album as four-piece in 16 years, The Magic Whip.
Guitarist Graham Coxon said they started recording in Hong Kong when a gig was cancelled.
He said: "we thought we'd put a few days, five or six days, to good use".
The album is influenced by the band's time in Far East.
Damon Albarn confirmed one song was about time he spent in North Korea: "it's my impression of the place, in a very abstract veiled way.
"When you listen to it is pretty self explanatory what it's about".
The singer also said it was nice to work with a basic set-up when they first started to make the album to see what they could create.
He told the news conference that "we didn't have much stuff so it was like recording when we first started doing stuff.  It was a really small studio, it was really hot and claustrophobic.
"We just went in there and knocked about some ideas."
The album will be released on 27 April.

article Red Bull are frustrated with partner Renault's failure to master the hybrid engines introduced into F1 last year.
Motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said Red Bull were interested in doing a deal that would see Audi enter F1.
"If we don't have a competitive engine in the near future, then either Audi is coming or we are out," said Marko.
But he denied Red Bull had already been in formal talks with the German company, which is part of the Volkswagen Group.
Marko told BBC Sport: "There are so many rumours. Officially there was no request or talks. The VW Group first has to sort out who will be the new chief of support, who will run the brand of VW, and when they have sorted all these things maybe then they can think about what they are doing in motorsport.
"I was on the phone but not to the people you think."
Like all teams, Red Bull have a contractual commitment to race in F1 until 2020. They also have a contract with Renault at least until the end of the 2016 season.
Marko's remarks are a reference to a power struggle taking place at the very top of the VW Group, which also has Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Skoda and Seat among its brands.
Ferdinand Piech, who had led the German giant for more than 20 years, resigned as chairman last month.
The 78-year-old was a staunch opponent of any of VW's brands entering F1, partly because of his personal antipathy towards F1 commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone.
Uncertainty continues to surround the senior management of Audi as a replacement for Piech has not yet been announced. His two nieces were appointed to the board to replace him and his wife, who resigned at the same time.
Senior sources in the German car industry believe Audi chairman Rupert Stadler is keen on an F1 entry, but that idea was vetoed in January by Piech.
The team had further trouble with their Renault engines at the Spanish Grand Prix last weekend.
Reliability problems mean Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo has already used four engines this season - which is as many as each driver is allowed to use throughout the year.
Red Bull, whose other driver Daniil Kvyat has also suffered engine failures, know it is inevitable they will be hit by grid penalties for using extra engines.
Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, by contrast, have used only one engine for all five races so far.
Marko said: "I hope the reliability issues are solved pretty soon because it is really depressing how much we are losing on the straights."
He added: "Renault see the problems themselves and we have to try and find out these problems together. It is not only reliability, it is also that we did not run most of the practice sessions because of other issues. It is also a quality problem. "

article The two sides signed a historic peace accord in the Cuban capital Havana on Wednesday after 52 years of conflict.
Farc fighters will gather in mid-September for a "conference" to ratify the accord.
A Colombian referendum on the agreement will follow on 2 October.
The Farc's conference will be its tenth since 1965, and will be held in a remote region of southern Colombia between 13 and 19 September.
Hundreds of Colombians celebrated on the streets of Bogota after the signing was broadcast live from Havana, Cuba, where peace talks have been held for almost four years.
The conflict has killed an estimated 260,000 people and displaced millions.
President Juan Manuel Santos called the deal "the beginning of the end to the suffering, pain and tragedy of war".
At one end of the main table, occupying a place he has filled for more than four years, was a slender, bald man with a well-groomed moustache. He listened respectfully to the anthem without singing along although by now he probably knows the words.
But it is not his country's song. He is Dag Nylander, head of the Norwegian diplomatic team which - along with the hosts, Cuba - acted as guarantors for the Colombian peace process.
For long-standing observers of Colombia's negotiations, Mr Nylander is a familiar sight. He has been a ubiquitous presence at every key moment over the past few years, reading out the details of the accords in his flawless but accented Spanish. At points of high tension or finger-pointing, he seemed to bring a calming presence to the proceedings, an external voice and a Norwegian sense of order to an entangled and bitter dispute.
I caught up with him after the heady sense of elation of that night had subsided a little.

The two sides had signed a bilateral ceasefire in June, paving the way for a final agreement.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Farc will give up its armed struggle and join the legal political process.
The left-wing rebels have been fighting the government since 1964.
It is the longest-running conflict in Latin America.

article The 30-year-old shook off fellow Kenyan Emmanuel Mutai with just under three miles remaining to become the first man to run a marathon in less than two hours and three minutes.
Mutai, who finished second in 2:03:13, also broke the previous record.
"I feel good because I won a very tough race," said Kimetto.
"I felt good from the start and in the last few miles I felt I could do it and break the record."
The previous world record had been set on the same course 12 months ago by Kimetto's compatriot Wilson Kipsang, who ran 2:03:23.
Kimetto, who won marathons in Tokyo and Chicago last year, had promised to attack the record in Berlin if conditions allowed.
And in weather perfect for long-distance running, with temperatures around eight degrees centigrade, Kimetto kept his promise, staying in the lead group throughout and sprinting to victory and a new world's best time.
Mutai, meanwhile, believes a two-hour marathon is possible.
"From what I saw today, times are coming down and down. So if not today, then tomorrow," the 29-year-old Kenyan said. "Maybe next time we'll get 2:01."
Scott Overall was the top British athlete in the men's race, finishing 14th in 2:13:00.

article Former Rangers player Naismith, 25, scored his third goal in as many games in a win at Hartlepool on Saturday.
He found himself out of favour at Pompey at the end of last season, but has netted nine league goals this term.
"I'm producing and doing what I need to do," he told BBC Radio Solent. "It feels good to play for this club."
Naismith was given the option to leave Portsmouth last summer at the end of his first season at Fratton Park, which included a loan spell at Hartlepool.
Having previously secured a promotion with Rangers from the Scottish Third Division, he said a second one of his career with Pompey would rank higher.
"No disrespect to the teams in that league, but it's not as good as League Two and this would be a bigger promotion," he said.
Third-placed Portsmouth have a six-point lead over Stevenage in fourth with six games to play, but Naismith is refusing to look too far ahead.
"I know it's an old cliche, but's it's game by game," he said. "We've built up momentum quickly, but you can just as quickly lose it in football."

article About 3,000 demonstrators, mostly Native Americans, say the Dakota Access Pipeline threatens water supplies and sacred lands.
They have until 5 December to quit the Oceti Sakowin camp, says the Army Corp of Engineers, which owns the land.
Separately, North Dakota's governor has issued an emergency order to evacuate.
The emergency evacuation order, signed by Governor Jack Dalrymple on Monday, cites a snow blizzard as the reason for enforcing the removal of the Oceti Sakowin camp.
"Emergency services probably will not be available under current winter conditions," he says, after nearly six inches (15 cm) of snow fell near the protest camp, making nearby roads nearly impassable.
More than 200 tribal nations have united behind the cause, representing the largest alliance of indigenous people in the US in centuries.
Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, called the order "a menacing action meant to cause fear" and called upon authorities to affirm that they will not forcibly remove demonstrators.
"The most dangerous thing we can do is force well-situated campers from their shelters and into the cold", he added, criticising the police's previous use of high pressure water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures.
Protesters have spent months resisting the construction of the $3.8bn (£3bn) oil pipeline, which would cross the ancestral lands of the Sioux Nation and pass underneath the Missouri River.
The protest effort have brought together Native groups from around the US, making it the largest alliance of tribes that the country has ever seen.
The 1,200 miles (1,900km) long pipeline - which will carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois - has already been completed, except for the small section passing near Native American land.
The Obama administration has called upon the pipeline's owners to reroute it, in order to bypass the disputed land.
On Tuesday, local police began to limit supplies from entering the protest camp near the Standing Rock reservation in a bid to close it down.
Facing criticism, Morton County Sheriff's Office has since told Reuters news agency it will take "a more passive role" in enforcing the blockade,
The ban on supplies, including food, fuel, and building materials, was briefly enforced as part of the governor's emergency evacuation order.
Protesters have previously accused officials of embargoing vital supplies through a series of roadblocks - some of which have been in place since August.
The Army Corps of Engineers has also clarified its position on the evacuation of the camp in recent days, stating on Sunday that they have "no plans for forcible removal".
Instead, the federal agency said, resident protesters would be subject to fines.
In the past week, hundreds of US military veterans have arrived with the goal of "protecting the protesters", a Marine Corp veteran told Stars and Stripes.
Their posture at the camp shows "symbolic value", said Anthony Diggs, who is acting as a spokesman for the group.
"Veterans Stand for Standing Rock" plans to remain at the camp until 7 December - after the deadline to vacate.
Police have made nearly 575 arrests since the protest began over the summer, creating a huge strain on the state's legal system.
"We don't have sufficient judges to get all of those cases heard in a timely fashion," said Sally Holewa, North Dakota's state court administrator.
Only about 8% of those arrested come from North Dakota, with nearly a quarter coming from the West Coast, according to arrest figures from Morton County.

article Local TV stations broadcast footage showing the room where death row inmates are hanged.
Analysts say the move is expected to stir public debate over the use of the death penalty in Japan, which is criticised by human rights groups.
Japan's justice minister opposes the death penalty, but official surveys suggest strong public backing for it.
"This reporting opportunity will provide information for public debate on the death penalty system,"  Keiko Chiba told a news conference.
The 30-minute tour showed the red square on the floor where a convict stands with a noose around their neck before the trapdoor opens beneath them.
The visitors were also taken to a room with a Buddhist altar where condemned prisoners can meet a religious representative, and the viewing chamber.
"There was the smell of incense. The impression was that of sterile objects in a clean, carpeted room," said a reporter from broadcaster NTV.
Footage also showed the room where three staff each push a button which releases the trapdoor - although none knows who actually instigated the action.
The noose was not shown.
Japan hanged two death row inmates in July, in the first executions since the new government took power last year.
Ms Chiba witnessed the executions at the Tokyo Detention Centre and announced the formation of a group to review the death penalty.
Her appointment last September - when the new Democratic Party-led government came to power - was seen as a sign that debate could be opened on the issue.
There is also concern because a new lay judge system could allow ordinary citizens, as well as professional judges, to issue death penalties.
A total of 107 inmates remain on death row in Japan. Prisoners are usually executed two or three at a time.
Last year, a report from rights group Amnesty International called for an immediate moratorium on executions in Japan, saying that harsh conditions on death row were driving inmates insane.
Prisoners are not told when they will be executed and their relatives are told only after the sentence has been carried out.
Official government figures recently issued in Japan put public support for capital punishment at well over 80%.

article Clocking up 20 hours a week of TV time appears to be detrimental, the US authors from Harvard say in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
Yet 15 hours or more of exercise a week boosts semen quality, according to the results in nearly 200 college students.
The researchers said more studies were needed to explore the possible causes.
And some experts say men wanting to conceive need to be selective about the sport they do as some types may harm sperm.
Too much time riding a bike or doing long-distance running in tight clothing may not be good, other studies suggest.
Similarly, wearing tight underwear rather than boxer shorts has been linked with lower sperm levels.
In the latest study, the researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health asked 189 young men who were students at a university in New York to record how many hours they had been spending doing physical activity and watching TV in a typical week.
The volunteers, all aged between 18 and 22, were also asked to provide a sperm sample for lab analysis.
When the researchers compared the survey findings with the sperm test results they found the link between sedentary lifestyle and low sperm count.
Men who were the most physically active, doing 15 hours or more of moderate to vigorous exercise each week by playing football, baseball or basketball for example, had sperm counts which were 73% higher than those who were least physically active.
Those who spent lots of time watching TV or DVDs - at least 20 hours a week - had a sperm count that was 44% lower than men who spent little time in front of the box.
None of the men had sperm counts so low that doctors would classify them as sub-fertile.
Sperm motility (how well it swims) and shape were unaffected.
The researchers say their findings are not conclusive but suggest that men who want to improve their fertility might want to look at increasing the amount of physical exercise they do if they currently do little.
It is not clear why sitting on the sofa watching TV might lower sperm count. It might be down to temperature - sperm prefer cooler conditions and production halts if the scrotum gets too hot.
Obesity may also affect fertility - although most of the men were not overweight.
Dr Audrey Jane Gaskins and colleagues say more studies are needed to confirm and explore the possible causes behind their findings.
Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said: "It remains to be seen if coaxing a TV-watching couch potato into doing some regular exercise could actually improve his sperm count. Or whether there exists an unknown fundamental difference between men who like exercise and those who do not which might account for the findings.
"This should be a relatively easy study to perform, but before all worried men hunt for their sports bag it's important to note that other research suggests that doing too much exercise can be harmful to sperm production.
"My advice would be everything in moderation - and that includes time in the gym as well as watching TV."
summary TV watching is not the best way to stay fit, according to a study.

article Earlier in the trial at Preston Crown Court, Cregan admitted killing Greater Manchester PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in a gun and grenade attack.
Later on in proceedings he also pleaded guilty to killing father and son David and Mark Short.
Three other men were convicted over the murders of the Shorts.
Luke Livesey, 28, and Damian Gorman, 38, were found guilty of their part in the murder of Mark Short in a shooting at the Cotton Tree Inn, Droylsden, in May 2012 as well as the attempted murder of three others in the same attack.
Jermaine Ward, 24, was convicted of killing David Short at his Clayton home in August.
Cregan, Livesey and Gorman murdered Mark Short following a decade-long feud between two local families, the court heard.
Fearful of retaliation attacks by the Short family, Cregan then planned the killing of his father David in a gun and grenade attack, the jury was told.
Cregan was cleared of the attempted murder of Sharon Hark, although he was found guilty of a grenade attack on her home minutes after David Short was killed.
The double murderer then went on the run for weeks before luring the two PCs to their deaths with a fake report of a burglary in Abbey Gardens, Mottram, on 28 September.
He handed himself in to police immediately after killing the officers, a crime in which he again used his "calling card" grenades.
Following the trial, PC Bone's father Paul said the killings were "unreal - the level of callousness is beyond my comprehension".
Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy said: "All four of these murders were planned assassinations, meticulously calculated by their perpetrators.
"Those responsible for the murders of Fiona, Nicola, Mark and David Short are established criminals who are a scourge on our society.
"These men, and others like them, make themselves out to be 'Mr Bigs', glamorising themselves as some kind of folk heroes who rule through violence, intimidation and reputation.
"But in reality they spend their miserable lives looking over their shoulders to see who is coming after them and their families."
Anthony Wilkinson, 34, had previously admitted his part in the murder of Mark Short's father, although he was cleared of the attempted murder of Sharon Hark.
He was also found guilty of possessing a gun with intent to endanger life.
Francis Dixon was cleared over the killing of David Short and all other charges.
Leon Atkinson, 35, Ryan Hadfield, 29, and Matthew James, 33, were cleared of all charges including any involvement in Mark Short's murder and the attempted murders at the Cotton Tree Inn.
Mohammed Imran Ali, 32, was found guilty of assisting an offender by taking Cregan, Wilkinson and Ward to hide out in Yorkshire knowing they had murdered David Short.

article Harambe, a western lowland gorilla, was killed at Cincinnati Zoo earlier this year after a three-year-old boy fell into his enclosure.
On Wednesday, Philadelphia Zoo said it would allow the public to vote on a name for the newborn.
Social media users quickly swamped the zoo with thousands of messages.
The newborn is the same subspecies - Gorilla gorilla gorilla - as Harambe.
Zookeepers, however, said the name will be put to a public poll from a selection chosen by staff members.
There has been no confirmation that Harambe will make that shortlist and the competition has not even opened yet.
That, however, has not stopped thousands of calls for the name online.
Philadelphia Zoo said they were "amazed and humbled" by the "outpouring of support and genuine excitement".
The newborn's sex is still unknown, as the baby is being held close by its mother, Honi.
Zookeepers said staff will make suggestions once they know if it is a boy or a girl - and rely on the public to vote from those choices in the coming weeks.
"We are very excited to welcome Honi's new baby," said Dr Andy Baker, the zoo's Chief Operating Officer.
"This birth is an opportunity to engage our visitors in caring about the future of gorillas in the wild."
Harambe's death in May this year, accompanied by sensational video footage of the three-year-old child in danger, made international headlines.
In the wake of the shooting, many questioned the need for killing the animal, despite the keepers at Cincinnati Zoo insisting they had no choice.
That led to a wide range of internet memes and an online campaign of "Justice for Harambe", which later became a joke in online circles.
The zoo itself said it was "not amused" by the online jokes and closed its Twitter account, after months of Harambe references being posted in response to every tweet.

article The Turkish athlete has also been banned for eight years, the Court of Arbitration for Sport confirmed.
An appeal by world governing body the IAAF was upheld after the 29-year-old was cleared in Turkey.
Straight after the race, Britain's Lisa Dobriskey, who finished ninth, told BBC Radio 5 live: "I don't believe I'm competing on a level playing field."
Alptekin's competitive results since July 2010 have been annulled after abnormal values were found in blood samples.
She served a two-year ban after a positive test as a junior in 2004.
Speaking to 5 live after the punishment was announced, Dobriskey, 31, said: "It was unbelievable how good she looked, running the times that she was running and how dominant she was. I just wasn't comfortable racing her.
"Once an athlete has served a drugs ban and they come back running significantly quicker then they were previously it always arouses suspicion.
"Like in any profession, you are a master of your trade as an athlete. You know the sport and you know how good you need to be to be successful and how hard it is to get there.
"When you see something suspicious or out of the ordinary, it is very rare that you can trust it. There was always that element of suspicion and doubt amongst my fellow athletes, competitors and training partners."
The case comes during a series of allegations of doping in athletics made by the Sunday Times and a German broadcaster.
Last week the IAAF said it was suspending 28 athletes as a result of suspicious findings in doping tests.

John Keith Mumberson, her drug worker, told the Milford Haven hearing on Tuesday she appeared to be looking to the future during their last meeting.
But he said she could act impulsively and could be blasÃ© about her own safety.
Mr Mumberson had worked with Seren to address her drug and alcohol use, and would meet her for hourly sessions at her school.
On Monday, the inquest had heard a mental health assessment which highlighted Seren had suicidal thoughts was not shared with her social worker.
But Mr Mumberson told the hearing Seren had never indicated any suicidal feelings to him.
He said Seren's foster parents were providing a "secure and positive" environment and he thought things were improving for the teenager.
"My overriding memory is that she was starting to look forward," he said.
"She was in a safe environment and we could move on from there. That's what I remember of our last meeting."

article They were seized when the jihadists swept through al-Qaryatain in Homs province, monitoring groups say.
Many of the Christians had fled to al-Qaryatain to escape fighting in Aleppo province to the north.
Islamic State (IS) has treated Christians harshly in other places under its control.
The group follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and has previously ordered Christians to convert, pay jizya (a religious levy), or face death.
According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), at least 230 people were seized by Islamic State (IS) fighters in al-Qaryatain.
Some were taken from inside a church, SOHR said. It said IS was hunting down a list of people it suspected of "collaborating with the regime".
The Assyrian Federation of Sweden, whose members have relatives in the town, said about 100 families were being held.
The federation says it has not been able to contact anyone inside the town and the conditions of the captives are not known.
The SOHR said "at least 60" Christians were among those being held.
Earlier this year, dozens of Assyrian Christians were abducted by IS militants in attacks on villages in Hassakeh province in north-east Syria.
A local Christian militia said it believed the captives were taken away to a mountain, but their fate since then is unclear.

article James Purdie was caught with 115 images on his computer after police raided his home in Ardrossan.
The 32-year-old, who had file-shared with other paedophiles, told officers: "Everything you have found is mine."
Purdie admitted downloading and possessing the images at two addresses in Irvine between November 2014 and November 2015. Sentence was deferred.
Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard that several of the pictures were at the highest level of depravity, featuring girls as young as two being abused.
Purdie's name was also added to the sex offenders' register.

article Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008.
He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information.
Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a "reasonable expectation of privacy".
Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy.
Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine "sting" operation.
Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.
In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.
Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private.
On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: "Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts."
Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines.
In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was "not burdensome" to do so.
However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.
On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded.
The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.

article Hundreds of passengers flying with Ryanair, Easyjet and British Airways will continue to face flight cancellations until Tuesday.
Ryanair said it had cancelled about 200 flights while Easyjet said it had cancelled 145 flights on Monday.
The strike is in protest at planned staff cuts.
It has been called by UNSA-ICNA, the third largest French union for air traffic controllers, which has said the cuts are unrealistic due to the "operational needs of control centres".
The union said air traffic was going to grow and it criticised the French Civil Aviation Authority for being too slow to invest in new technology.
Ryanair and Easyjet are two of the five founding members of the newly formed lobby group, Airlines for Europe.
The others are Air France KLM, International Airlines Group and Lufthansa.
Easyjet said in a statement that the group was working with the other carriers "to call on governments and the EU to develop an action plan to minimise the impact of air traffic control strikes on passengers."
Robin Kiely, head of communications at Ryanair, said: "It's grossly unfair that thousands of ordinary European consumers have their travel and holiday plans disrupted by the actions of a selfish few."
The airliner, which has been the most outspoken of the carriers, repeated its demand that the European Commission ban air traffic controllers from striking to prevent passengers being "held to ransom."
Ryanair said the strike was not only affecting travellers going to and from France but also those flying through French air space.
It wants other air traffic controllers in Europe to be allowed to manage flights over French airspace during such action.
The airline also urged consumers to sign its "Keep Europe's Skies Open" petition to the European Commission.
When it has obtained 1m signatures it said it planned to present it to the EU Commission and the EU parliament.
Passengers travelling from Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton Airport are being forced to wait for or reschedule their flights due to the action which started on Sunday.
The DGAC, France's Civil Aviation Authority, said it had requested a third of flights were cancelled to and from Paris-Orly and other regional airports on Monday.
Air France warned of last minute cancellations and delays but said it planned to operate its long-haul services and all flights to and from Paris Charles de Gaulle, which is unaffected.
British Airways refused to disclose how many flights would be affected by the strike, but said it was doing "all we can to minimise disruption to customers affected".
It said it was using larger aircraft where it could.
Gatwick Airport warned customers to check with their airline for flight updates.
summary Flights to and from London Heathrow have been cancelled due to the weather.

article The DB4GT Coupe sold for £3,249,500 in the Bonham's auction at Aston Martin Works in Newport Pagnell.
The car, which retailed for about £4,500 when it was new, had been restored at the works by its last owner.
Bonham's said bidding was rising at increments of £100,000 at a time.
Aston Martin Works said the previous record was for an Aston Martin DB5, which was used in one of the James Bond films, which sold for £2.5m in 2010.
The record is for road cars and does not take racing cars into account as they can go for over £10m.
This record-breaking car, called The Jet, was the last DB4GT off the Newport Pagnell production line and was the only one with coachwork by Italian designers Bertone.
The sale also featured three "barn finds" which had been hidden in storage for over 30 years - a 1966 DB6 Vantage Sports Saloon Project, a 1964 DB5 Sports Saloon and a 1963 DB4 Series V Vantage Sports Saloon.
They fetched £609,300 between them, while overall the auction of 197 lots sold for £10m.
James Knight, Bonham's motoring director, said: "I really did not think we could eclipse the record-breaking total achieved at this sale last year, but I am thrilled that  in Aston Martin's centenary year we have achieved just that.
"To sell every lot in an auction is almost unprecedented."

article The campaign used the slogan "fresh in our memories" over photos of World War One soldiers, echoing Woolworth's slogan "The fresh food people".
Minister for Veterans' Affairs Michael Ronaldson said he had demanded the company take down the campaign.
Woolworths has said it regrets any offence caused.
The row comes as Australia and New Zealand prepare to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings on 25 April 1915.
The Woolworths website had encouraged visitors to change their social media profile pictures by uploading images of past and present servicemen and servicewomen.
The picture generator branded the images with its logo and the words: "Lest We Forget Anzac 1915-2015. Fresh in our memories."
Woolworths' slogan in Australia is "The Fresh Food People", but the company denied it was a marketing strategy.
Many visitors to its Facebook page disagreed though.
Other disgruntled consumers created their own versions of the generated images and uploaded them on to social media.
Analysis: Wendy Frew, Australia editor, BBC News Online
Anzac Day is arguably Australia's most important national occasion. It marks the anniversary of the first campaign that led to major casualties for Australian and New Zealand forces during World War One and commemorates all the conflicts that followed.
The problem is, for some time Woolworths has branded itself "the fresh food people".
The ensuing backlash on social media showed Australians don't want Gallipoli - which in recent years has been elevated to an almost spiritual plane -  tainted by commercial considerations.
That reverence is backed by law. In 1921, regulations were put in place to protect the word "Anzac" from inappropriate use.
Why Australia protects 'Anzac'
Mr Ronaldson said in a statement: "The Australian community quite rightly expects that the word 'Anzac' is not trivialised or used inappropriately and as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I am responsible for ensuring that any use of the word Anzac does not provide commercial benefit to an organisation.
"In this instance, permission was not sought by the campaign proponents, nor would it have been approved. Immediately upon having this campaign brought to my attention, I contacted Woolworths."
The company said in a statement: "The Fresh in Our Memories website has been taken down. The site was developed to give our staff and customers a place to put their stories to mark the centenary of Anzac.
"We regret that our branding on the picture generator has caused offence, this was clearly never our intention.  Like many heritage Australian companies, we were marking our respect for Anzac and our veterans.
"We continue to be proud supporters of the RSL (Returned and Services League) and Camp Gallipoli in this important year and look forward to working with them into the future."

article Thomas McIntyre, 42, attacked 27-year-old James Gunn with a knife at the doorway of his new flat in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, on 4 October 2014.
He denied carrying out the attack but was convicted of attempted murder after being identified by five witnesses.
Mr Gunn required a number of stitches including one to repair an artery.
Jailing McIntyre at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Matthews told him: "I have rarely heard evidence that was so overwhelming."
The court heard that Mr Gunn had invited friends to a housewarming at his flat in the town's Mill Grove.
In the early hours of the morning he answered a knock at the door.
The victim told the court: "It was the neighbour directly above us - Thomas McIntyre.
"He said to me 'the music is too loud... I have been banging down to tell you to shut up'."
The court was told that McIntyre said he had a "wee girl up the stairs".
Mr Gunn recalled apologising and insisted that he had not heard McIntyre before the latter attacked him.
Mr Gunn, who gave evidence from behind screens, told the court: "He swung the knife and I stepped back when I saw it coming towards me.
"It got me on the neck... from the jugular down the jaw line."
The victim managed to slam the door closed, but then slumped into the arms of a friend.
He said: "I saw that there was a lot of blood, so I screamed for help. My friend wrapped a shirt around my neck to stop the bleeding."
Mr Gunn was rushed to hospital and required a number of stitches including one to repair an artery.
McIntyre, also of Hamilton, gave evidence during the trial, but denied being the attacker.
He claimed: "I am being accused of something that I did not do and I do not know why."
McIntyre said he was at his mother's home at the time of the attack but the court heard that five witnesses - including Mr Gunn - had seen and heard him that night.

article Suso had looked set to be AC Milan's match-winning hero with two goals, before Perisic pounced in injury time.
Ex-Liverpool winger Suso curled home Milan's opener before Antonio Candreva smashed in an equaliser.
Suso scored again from a jinking run but Perisic turned home a corner from close range to deny Milan the chance to go 11 points above their rivals.
Read how the action unfolded here.
Former Lazio boss Piolo took charge of a Nerazzurri game for the first time, having been named Frank de Boer's replacement during the international break.
A derby defeat would have been the worst start imaginable, especially one that would have left them 11 points behind their rivals.
But Inter deserved their draw, with Candreva's first equaliser a brilliant 25-yard effort, and they took risks in the end, with goalkeeper Samir Handanovic coming up for the corner which Perisic converted.

article They were moved to an isolated army camp in the north-west last year after surrendering in the volatile east, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says.
They received minimal food and health supplies, some apparently surviving on crops stolen from farmers' fields.
Defence Minister Alexandre Luba Ntambo said the accusations were irresponsible
There had, he told the BBC, been problems funding the government's demobilisation programme.
"We did not purposely leave people to die," he said, adding that international donors had failed to deliver aid.
"Many ambassadors and UN staff have already visited the camp and everyone agrees that access is difficult, which is why the conditions are bad."
The UN says it is now sending teams to the area to evaluate the needs of the camp and will provide help shortly.
Numerous armed groups are still active in eastern DR Congo, despite the end of the civil war more than a decade ago. Militias are able to make money from the region's minerals, some of which are used to make mobile phones.
According to HRW, 941 fighters from various armed groups surrendered and were sent to the Kotakoli camp in September last year along with several hundred family members to await integration into military or civilian life.
This was expected to take about three months, but a year on they remain at the camp.
Supplies ran out after three months - and then getting more provisions proved difficult because the area is surrounded by dense forest and is almost inaccessible by road.
With little to eat and virtually no healthcare, many people became ill and reportedly died from malnutrition and disease.
Research by HRW at the camp in September found 42 demobilised combatants, at least five women and 57 children had died since December.
"People lost so much weight it was like you could see into their stomachs," a 44-year-old former fighter told HRW. "The children were really like skeletons,"
A 28-year-old, who had been part of an armed group in North Kivu, said that people looked like the "photos of the famine in Somalia and Ethiopia".
A father, also 28, told HRW about how his nine-year-old daughter and seven-year-old daughter had become ill and died: "There was no food and I didn't have the means to find [food] for my family.
"I helplessly watched them dying."
The army commander has allowed the disarmed militia members to go into Kotakoli village to try to find food and menial work, but HRW says the remoteness of the area means there is little means of survival.
"Before more people die, the government should immediately move them to a place where they have food and healthcare and are treated with basic human decency," Ida Sawyer, a senior researcher for HRW in DR Congo, said in a statement.
She also called for the UN peacekeeping mission to play a larger role in the programme to demobilise fighters.

article The two teams went into the game level on points in Pool Five - both trailing leaders Wasps by six.
George Ford kicked Bath ahead on three occasions at the Stade Felix Mayol but Toulon's Eric Escande matched him every time from the tee.
And despite a strong second half from Bath, Freddie Michalak landed the winning penalty after 75 minutes.
The first ever meeting between the two sides was due to be played back in November, but was postponed following the deadly attacks on Paris.
Bath came into the rearranged fixture in inconsistent form, having lost two of their last three games in all competitions.
But they put in a fantastic performance in France, against a Toulon side who have not lost in 17 European matches at home.
The Premiership club picked up a losing bonus point but they must now win both their remaining pool games, against Leinster and a return match against Toulon at the Rec, to stand a chance of progressing to the quarter-finals.
Fly-half Ford has been struggling for form since he was dropped by England during last year's World Cup, but the 22-year-old looked rediscovered his confidence against Toulon - perhaps aided by his impressive partnership with Chris Cook, who was brought in at scrum-half in place of the injured Nikola Matawalu.
Ford kicked the opening penalty and landed two out of three drop-goal attempts to give his side a narrow lead in Sunday's contest.
But Toulon scrum-half Escande kept pulling the three-time champions level, and the Toulon defence held off a fired-up Bath attack as the clock ticked down in the second half.
The visitors were also forced into desperate defending. Josua Tuisova went on a blistering run only to be halted by full-back Anthony Watson, while his England team-mate Semesa Rokoduguni was on hand to clear the danger from Juan Smith out wide.
In the end, it fell to replacement Michalak to grab the winner after Bath conceded a needless penalty with five minutes left on the clock.
Bath fly-half George Ford told BBC Radio Bristol: "It's pretty devastating. To come out here and perform like that the attitude was there today and small margins in the game.
"We had good field position but little errors at the end gave them field position to kick the late penalty. I'm unbelievably proud of the boys today to put in a show like that.
"It was more like us, the feel was similar to last year, great energy and enthusiasm. We're still alive in the pool, we just need to prepare right and show up mentally."

article Taylor will make her professional debut at Wembley's SSE Arena on 26 November.
The 30-year-old five-time world champion has signed a deal with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing.
"It depends on the character, the success, their home market, but a UK name can go all the way and certainly earn big money," said Sauerland.
The German promoter, 39, said the likes of Norway's Cecilia Braekhus commanded similar money while American Laila Ali "wouldn't enter the ring under seven figures".
"Katie has got a great mix. She has the potential to go all the way and sell out the big arenas," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
5 live boxing pundit Steve Bunce said Taylor "will be a star", but that matching the Bray lightweight may prove difficult.
"She will sell out arenas all over the world," he added. "She is an absolute icon in Ireland, both sides of the border. She will be perfect."

article Those identified were then subjected to anti-semitic abuse via social media.
The symbol has been described as a secret signal because punctuation does not show up in ordinary web searches.
Google said that the extension was blocked from its store because it broke its hate speech rules.
The tech giant declined to comment further.
It was called the "coincidence detector" - a reference to a conspiracy theory about Jewish people and global control.
The extension was developed by a far-right group called alt-right.
It had around 2,500 users and a database of 8,800 common Jewish names which it could pick out on websites reported tech site Mic.
The symbol stems from a right-wing group called the Right Stuff, who told Mic it was "a critique of Jewish power".
Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor of the New York Times, wrote about his experience of receiving a tweet with his name wrapped around with brackets.
When he asked what it meant the tweeter replied that he was "belling the cat".
"The anti-Semitic hate hasn't stopped since," wrote Mr Weisman, who has now altered his name on Twitter to include the brackets himself. Others are doing the same in support.
"Nobody's telling us to self-identify. We are showing strength and fearlessness," he tweeted in response to a journalist who said it made her uncomfortable.
He also said that much of the hate appeared to come with "self-identified Donald J Trump supporters" - and many had Twitter names which included the US presidential candidate's name.

article Ports, fearing they will not get paid, refuse to let them dock or unload.
That means the ships are forced to wait for Hanjin, its creditors or partners to find a solution.
It's a case of unprecedented scale, with experts expecting the deadlock to last for weeks, if not months.
"[It is] a major disaster for the shipping companies and for the companies that own the goods in those containers," Greg Knowler, maritime and trade analyst with IHS Markit, told the BBC from Hong Kong.
Read more: Shipping giant Hanjin to enter receivership
Not only are ships not allowed to unload, containers waiting to be picked up are also being held back by the ports as collateral over unpaid bills.
And even if the ports did allow them in, Hanjin would probably not as the vessels could expect to be immediately repossessed by the firm's creditors.
Beyond the ships and containers, there is of course the cargo within those containers - in many cases part of a tight chain of supply and delivery.
By September, the global shipping industry is already into what is its busiest time of the year ahead of the Christmas season.
"Just imagine, there are some 540,000 containers with cargo caught up at sea," explains Lars Jensen, chief executive of Sea Intelligence Consulting in Copenhagen.
That means that a lot of the goods en route to the US are geared at the busy year-end holidays and any disruption will be a major headache for the companies that have entrusted their products into the hauls of the Hanjin freighters.
Let's break down the somewhat confusing ownership structure at play here.
Hanjin operates partly with its own ships, and partly with vessels it leases from others. So some of the vessels stuck at sea are owned by other companies who now can't get them back and on top of that have to assume they won't get paid for leasing them in the first place.
The containers on board the ships are also not all Hanjin's own. As the company is part of an alliance with five other cargo firms, there will be a mix of containers on each vessel - some belonging to Hanjin, the rest to the other four partners.
And lastly, there are the firms who own the content of the containers, for instance an Asian electronics firm sending its goods to the US market.
Hanjin's bankruptcy is the largest ever to hit the shipping industry so there's no roadmap as to what will happen now, no precedent of comparable scale.
There are the containers stuck at ports.
Let's take a container brought from, say, the Philippines to Hong Kong, to then be picked up from there and taken to the US.
Berthing and handling of that cargo at the Hong Kong port costs money. If Hanjin can't pay that, the port will hold on to those containers as collateral until someone will be willing to pay.
A possible solution would be that the companies who own the contents of those containers ask other shipping companies to step in and pick up where Hanjin left off. The cost of this would be immense, and would come on top of anything they had already paid to Hanjin beforehand. Part of it might be covered by insurance but it would still be an extremely costly endeavour.
The containers stuck on board the ships are the next problem. While at sea, there is no way to get the cargo off board.
Ships that are only leased by Hanjin could see their actual owner take back control and bring them into a harbour. They would still need to be cleared of their cargo but could then be leased to other companies.
Given that the owners of any leased vessels would probably not want to foot the bill themselves they may try to draft in the four partner lines that have containers on the ship or maybe even the companies whose cargo is inside those containers.
The ships owned by Hanjin itself would most likely have to be sold before anyone would bring in the money to get them into a port and cleared. The fact that they would have to be sold as is, i.e. at sea, and with a load of overdue containers on board would probably weigh down the price of the vessels.
Each stranded ship has about 15 to 25 crew on board. Unable to call at any port, they will have to depend on the supplies they have with them until a solution can be found. While food should last long enough, they will eventually need fuel.
In a worst-case scenario, should they find themselves unable to pay for fuel being delivered by a shuttle, they would risk running into serious trouble. In that case though, nearby ports would likely be forced to accept them.
Aside from the prospect of being stuck for weeks at sea, the sailors will also face uncertainly over their wages. Most of them are not actually hired by Hanjin but by crewing agencies. Those agencies are unlikely to get paid by Hanjin and therefore won't be able to pay the crews.
"Unless someone steps in very quickly - and there is no sign of that - this will last a very long time," according to Mr Jensen.
Ships, cargo and crew might find themselves stuck for weeks, if not months, without knowing when and where their current voyage will end.
summary The Chinese shipping company Hanjin has been unable to pay its workers for months,

article He was on his way to work on a highway west of Cairo on 22 July when his car was stopped by a group of armed men.
The Croatian foreign ministry said the group "forced him to get out of the car and drove away with him in an unknown direction".
Mr Salopek was not heard from again until he appeared in a video last week from Sinai Province, the new Egypt-based affiliate of the Islamic State group.
Speaking in English, he confirmed his identity and said the militant group had threatened to kill him unless the Egyptian government released all female Muslim prisoners.
Following the release of the video, Ardiseis Egypt, a subsidiary of CGG, confirmed he was one of their employees.
Zlatko Salopek, Tomislav's father, in an appeal for his son's release, had said his only motivation "to go to your homeland was exclusively to earn bread for his children. Nothing else".
He is reported to have been married for eight years and, according to AFP news agency, he was described as a friendly young man by neighbours in his home town in Croatia.
It is not clear how long Mr Salopek had been in Egypt, but according to his Linkedin profile he had been working for CGG since last December.
His career profile shows he was no stranger to the region.
Last year, he spent eight months working as a surveyor in Libya for the North African Geophysical Exploration Company (Nageco).
He had also spent time in Syria, Morocco and Iraq.
Announcing his alleged beheading on social media, alongside the publication of a gruesome photo, the militant group said Mr Salopek was killed for Croatia's "participation in the war against the Islamic State".

article The sitcom returned to screens last month after a 13-year break.
The opening episode of the latest series was watched by an average of 5.8 million viewers on the evening it was broadcast and received warm reviews from critics.
Screenwriter Mike Bullen tweeted: "Yay! We get to do this all again! Thanks to all our fans for making this possible."
Production on the new eight-part series will begin in Manchester in March.
Bullen said of the series he created: "We all said we only wanted to bring Cold Feet back if we could maintain the standard previously set.
"I've been blown away by the show's reception among viewers and critics alike. It has exceeded even my hopes.
"This recommission confirms that we didn't screw it up. I shall take a moment to bask in the warm glow... OK, done that. Now the hard graft resumes."
ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said: "It's with some trepidation that you return to much-loved shows, but Mike Bullen's contemporary take on the five friends and their lives has been a wonderful thing.
"We were obviously delighted that the audience agreed, and we're pleased to be able to confirm that Cold Feet will return again for a further series."
The channel said the programme had been their most successful drama launch so far this year.
In August, actress Fay Ripley told the BBC returning to the programme after more than a decade felt like "putting on an old jumper".
Referring to her character Jen and husband Pete, played by John Thomson, Ripley tweeted: "It's official. New #ColdFeet series in pipeline. Don't know about u but I recs @_mikebullen should send Pete @ Jen to the Maldives?"

"It's something you dream about as a little kid," said Westbrook.
A triple-double means a player has recorded a double-digit number in three of five statistical categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.
Westbrook, 28, recently made the highest scoring triple-double in NBA history with 57 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists against Orlando Magic.
His performance against the Nuggets also saw him secure his third 50-point triple-double of the season, which is another record.

article Quite literally - LA-based street Artist Plastic Jesus (famous for his cocaine-snorting Oscar statue) got annoyed with being held up in traffic recently by a paparazzi scrum surrounding one or another of the sisters leaving a shop.
So he decided to do something about it.
He came up with the idea of banning the family from parking in several Los Angeles hotspots.
The artist created several signs which he bolted to other notices around Melrose Avenue, Robertson (near the Ivy restaurant) and elsewhere, reading No Kardashian Parking Any Time.
The artist explained to Newsbeat what the signs were inspired by.
"There is gridlock caused whenever one of the Kardashian family do simple basic things, shopping, eating out or pumping gas.
"The Kardashians have become a media cultural phenomenon, sadly at the expense of real news."
He said that the installation was intended not as an attack on the Kardashians, but on "us, both the media and the consumer".
He went on: "Media is circulation-driven, or more recently by hits on websites. Without our unending desire to consume this content this will continue."
The LAPD reportedly view the signs as vandalism, something Plastic rejects.
"The signs are only intended to be a temporary installation, like many other parking and driving signs around LA, they will be removed in the very near future."
UPDATE: As of Thursday morning, the official Plastic Jesus Twitter account confirmed his team has taken down the signs.

article Devon and Cornwall Police is relying on ??20m from the sale of land to Morrisons to pay for a new criminal justice centre at its headquarters site at Middlemoor, Exeter.
A police source said they were "in the dark" about what Morrisons would do.
The company said it was working to "finalise" the plans.
Devon and Cornwall Police's plans for a criminal justice centre would replace the custody unit at Exeter's ageing Heavitree Road Police station.
A police source said they were "now trying to uncouple that work from the building of the supermarket".
"Morrisons aren't being at all clear about their plans", the source added.
Morrisons failed to start construction work in April, which means stricter new energy efficiency standards will now be required, making the project significantly more expensive to build.
The concerns about Morrisons' plans have put a key part of the modernisation programme for Devon and Cornwall Police in doubt.
Senior officers are preparing for more budget cuts from the newly-elected government, on top of the tens of millions of pounds they've already lost.
This uncertainty represents an extra headache they could well do without.
The supermarket chain said it was continuing to work behind the scenes with Devon and Cornwall Police and Exeter City Council "to finalise the plans" and would "provide an update on its progress in due course".
Devon and Cornwall Police also said they were continuing to work with Morrisons and Exeter City Council "to progress the development".
In March, Morrisons announced an annual loss of ??792m. The chain already has one major store in Exeter.
In a statement, Exeter City Council, the planning authority, said, "Tighter building regulations came into force for buildings started after April. However, none of these buildings have been started yet."

article The extent of Theresa's May victory over the other two candidates makes her the clear favourite to move into Number 10 in September.
It's important to remember though, the contest moves from Westminster now out to the country for Tory supporters to make their minds up. And the party membership is not in any way bound to follow the recommendation of its MPs.
They are, like most British voters, a pretty determined bunch who are not necessarily well-disposed to being told what to do.
Enthusiasts for the home secretary full of delight at the extent of her victory may have to tread carefully, to avoid irking their constituency members by giving them instruction, rather than friendly advice.
The dramatic emergence of Andrea Leadsom as one of the final two marks her as a politician destined for a major job even if she doesn't win the contest.
A few weeks ago, before the referendum, she was not even particularly well known around Westminster, so for her to have reached this stage is a remarkable achievement in itself.
Tory MPs' decisions today also guarantee that the next prime minister will be a woman.
Maybe that shouldn't matter very much anymore, and it may not matter very much to that many people now, but it will only be the second time in our country's history that it will have happened - that alone makes it significant.
And for the political nerds, myself included, one of the wider significances about today's ballot?
It perhaps also marks a brutal end to the commanding influence of the group known as the Notting Hill Tories - who together pushed David Cameron to lead the party in 2005, then into Number Ten five years later.
They have controlled the upper echelons of the Tory party for a decade, and they hoped, if not even assumed that they would control the succession.
With Michael Gove's departure from the race, their power and control fade too, and along with them maybe a particular way of doing politics.
Look carefully at some of faces smiling behind May and Leadsom. That shift in power away from David Cameron's "set" explains at least some of the grins.

Council leader David Parker said the budget reflected an "ongoing commitment to protect frontline services and deliver significant investment".
The spending plans aim to save about £9.5m in the financial year ahead.
The council said an impact on staffing levels was "inevitable" but it would be achieved by managing vacancies, natural turnover and offering redeployment as well as early retirement and voluntary severance.
The local authority has estimated an increase in council tax will raise £1.5m towards funding its services.
The change will see payments for a band D property rise by £32.52 per year.

article She told the German Parliament a "qualified majority" of European leaders would be acceptable.
David Cameron says he will press the issue to a vote if Mr Juncker is nominated at an EU summit on Friday.
But Mrs Merkel said there would be "no drama" if he was chosen by a majority.
Previously, the top job in Brussels bureaucracy has usually only been given with the unanimous agreement of at least the bigger countries, including Britain.
'Not an arch villain'
The British prime minister has fought a lone campaign to block Mr Juncker becoming the next EC president, saying his appointment would "ignore the clear pro-change and pro-reform message" delivered by European voters in last month's election.
If Mr Juncker's name is tabled at Friday's EU summit in Brussels, Mr Cameron has said he would demand an "unprecedented" vote to put on the public record EU leaders' views on the ex-Luxembourg prime minister.
Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, Mr Juncker said he expected to be the next EC president by the end of the week "if common sense prevails".
And in a dig at Mr Cameron, he joked that common sense was "very unequally distributed - so one will have to wait".
Former Conservative chancellor, the pro-European Ken Clarke, said he did not know what Mr Juncker was supposed to have done wrong, insisting he was "not an arch villain".
"The idea that he is an arch-federalist, a sort of public enemy number one, which the media have made him in the last few days, is slightly exaggerated," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.
And Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Cameron's handling of the row had damaged Britain's influence in Brussels.
But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was "proud" to have a prime minister "who fights for Britain".

article In total, 238 incidents were reported in 2016/17 in buildings at least 10 storeys high, down more than half (52%) on 2009/10 when there were 499 fires.
It was also a drop on 2015/16 when there were 314 incidents, Scottish Fire and Rescue figures showed.
The statistics were released as investigations continue into the Grenfell Tower tragedy in London.
At least 80 people were killed when fire tore through the 24-floor tower early on 14 June, with the building's cladding suspected to be central to its spread.
The Scottish fire service's figures also revealed that casualty rates have decreased in buildings of more than 10 storeys, with 45 recorded in 2016/17, almost 30% down on the previous year when the figure stood at 64.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) assistant chief officer David McGown said: "The SFRS attends at every emergency and has an agreed standard operating procedure in place which sets out how fires in high-rise premises should be dealt with, utilising appropriate training and equipment, including high-reach appliances.
"Whilst it is encouraging to note an overall reduction in the number of fires affecting domestic properties, we are not complacent.
"We routinely carry out operational assurance visits at high-rise premises for the purposes of checking facilities and arrangements for firefighting and firefighter safety.
"In addition, we have specific safety information relating to high-rise premises available on the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service website.
"This includes tried and tested national advice regarding what to do in the event of a fire, should the fire occur in the flat you are in or elsewhere in the building."
In the past year, firefighters carried out 70,743 home fire safety visits, which help detect risks in the home.
They have also carried out more than 2,400 operational assurance visits at high-rise properties where communal facilities, such as stairwells, are checked for the purposes of firefighting and firefighter safety.
All high rise building built since 2005 must be fitted with sprinklers but there is no obligation to fit the potentially life-saving systems in older tower blocks.
Earlier this week, BBC Scotland revealed that more than 300 residential high rise buildings in Scotland do not have sprinklers.
It led to calls for the systems to be retrofitted in the buildings. The Scottish government said it would consider evidence about sprinklers as part of a wider review of fire safety in high rise buildings.

article Antony Lowry-Huws, 63, from Kinmel Bay near Rhyl, was described as the driving force behind the scams which took five years to bring to court.
He was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud, alongside his wife, a Conwy business partner, a Flintshire solicitor and a Lancashire surveyor.
The five will be sentenced in September.
The convictions follow a five-month trial in which the jury had to consider 50,000 items of evidence.
The court was told that Lowry-Huws, along with his four co-defendants, had duped mortgage lenders into handing over thousands of pounds on properties across north Wales.
Co-conspirator Frank Edward Darlington, from Barnoldswick in Lancashire, acted as the surveyor in the transactions, providing false property valuations and rental income figures.
Solicitor Nicholas John Jones, 53, based in Flint at the time, carried out the conveyancing work and submitted the fraudulent mortgage applications.
The scams were backed by Lowry-Huws' business partner, property speculator Sheila Rose Whalley from Llanfairtalhaiarn in the Conwy Valley, and also by Lowry-Huws' wife Susan.
In total, 189 mortgage applications were made between May 2003 and June 2008.
The prosecution said the deceit was achieved by inflating the actual value of the property used as security, hiding the fact that in some cases no deposit was put down, or inflating the rental income potential to make the mortgage rate more acceptable.
In some cases the apartments on which mortgages were advanced simply did not exist.
Judge Rhys Rowlands told Antony Lowry-Huws, Darlington and Whalley that they had acted out of "pure greed and nothing more", and warned them to expect "fairly significant" prison sentences.
He said he accepted that Susan Lowry-Huws had been acting under the influence of her husband, and that would be taken in to account during sentencing.
But he told solicitor Nicholas Jones: "Sadly, the same cannot be said for you.
"You plainly knew what was going on.
"An additional feature in your case is that it is a very clear breach of trust that you owed to the lenders, which you breached."
All five were granted bail to await sentencing, under the condition that they surrender their passports and are subject to a curfew monitored by electronic tagging.
The judge thanked the jurors for their diligence in considering the case and said he would excuse them from ever serving on a jury again.
Responding to the convictions, a spokesperson for North Wales Police said: "North Wales Police welcome the verdicts of guilty on individuals convicted of this substantial mortgage fraud, one of the largest investigations of this nature ever to be conducted in England and Wales.
"The investigation took almost five years to complete and get through trial.
"It is inappropriate at this stage to say more save to say thank you to all members of the investigative and prosecution team for their dedication and hard work on a very challenging inquiry."
A second surveyor - George Walker, 58, of Colwyn Bay - was found not guilty of any involvement by the jury.
All defendants denied conspiring to defraud and conspiring to falsify documents between May 2003 and June 2008 to induce false finance and mortgage payments.

article The Scot, who collected £200,000 after winning the China Championship last Saturday, earned another £100,000 after his 10-7 victory on Saturday.
Five-time world champion O'Sullivan, 40, had led 5-4 going into the evening session in the best-of-19-frame final.
Higgins, 41, won six of the next eight frames to beat O'Sullivan.
Four-time world champions Higgins momentarily lost concentration during the presentation.
He dropped the trophy on to the table, much to the amusement of the crowd at the Ricoh Arena.
"I can't speak for Ronnie but I was buzzed up coming into play. I just wish my old man was still here to see me take part in these finals," said Higgins, whose father died from cancer in 2011.
"There is no better feeling than doing it in front of a packed audience, playing against somebody as good as Ronnie."
O'Sullivan, who beat Mark Allen 6-2 on Friday to reach the final, said last month he was "not good enough to compete with the best players in the world".
He won his sixth Masters title in January and the Welsh Open in February.
"I need to find some consistency if I am going to win tournaments again," he said.
"Against most players I might have had a chance of winning but against world-class opposition I make too many mistakes."

article The Serie A visitors had the better chances in the first half but Vidal gave Sevilla a half-time lead when he steered home from the edge of the box after being picked out by Carlos Bacca.
After the break, Vitolo played Vidal in to send Neto the wrong way.
Kevin Gameiro added a third 28 seconds after coming off the bench.
This season's tournament takes on extra significance with the winners qualifying for next season's Champions League group stages. Neither Sevilla nor Fiorentina are on course to qualify through the league.
However, Sevilla already take the tournament seriously, as they look to successfully defend the trophy for the second time in a decade, having won it in 2006 and 2007. No team have ever won the Uefa Cup or Europa League four times.
But the visitors started brighter with Mario Gomez firing over twice in the opening 15 minutes.
They were punished for their wastefulness when Vitolo found Bacca, who in turn played the ball to Vidal to fire in from 18 yards out.
Fiorentina should have been level moments later as Matias Fernandez somehow missed from six yards after being picked out by Joaquin. The Chilean was then denied by keeper Sergio Rico, who also kept out an effort from Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah.
There was a hugely controversial moment on half-time when Sevilla midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak appeared to be fouled by Stefan Savic in the box - just as referee Felix Brych blew the whistle to end the half.
Fiorentina - who brought on English defender Micah Richards at half-time - were not able to take advantage of that good fortune and Vidal burst into the box to score his second.
The champions then put themselves in a great position to reach the Warsaw final when Gameiro converted Vidal's ball with his first touch after coming on as a substitute.
The second leg is in Florence next Thursday. The winners face Napoli or Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, who drew 1-1 in Italy, in the final.

article Dons assistant Tony Docherty joins the national coaching team for this month's fixtures against Canada and Slovenia.
But there are no players from the Pittodrie club, who sit second in the Scottish Premiership.
"I'm disappointed but I seem to be saying the same thing after every squad, so I'm not totally surprised," said McInnes.
"I think they should be in it, some have a stronger case than others."
Last month, McInnes backed Kenny McLean and Ryan Jack for Scotland call-ups after Aberdeen routed Motherwell.
But Scotland coach Gordon Strachan, a former Dons star, who was at Pittodrie to watch the 7-2 victory, has chosen 15 other midfielders in a 30-man squad for the impending double-header.
"We've really developed Niall McGinn [Northern Ireland] as an international player, Jonny Hayes and Adam Rooney [both Republic of Ireland] have become internationals here," added McInnes.
"Danny Ward [Wales] came here and was an international, so we can provide the platform.
"There are other clubs, lesser clubs, getting their players capped [for Scotland]."
Jack, 25, and McGinn, 29, are both out of contract in the summer, along with defender Ash Taylor, while the manager said that second-choice goalkeeper Neil Alexander would be moving on.
"Hopefully, we'll have news after the international break," said McInnes of the negotiations, adding "conversations are ongoing".
Chairman Stewart Milne has indicated that he would like McInnes to extend to his stay in order to lead the club into a proposed new stadium in 2020.
The Dons boss is under contract until 2019, having been in the post for four years.
"It's clear how happy I am here and I do feel we still have a lot of work to do, we want to finish this season strongly.
"If the chairman wishes to talk about it, I'm happy to sit down with him but we have a lot of challenges ahead of us.
"The chairman is busy trying to drive home the stadium and training ground and I'm busy trying to drive home performances on the pitch."

article There are concerns about the prison service in the Belfast Telegraph.
Despite having more staff than inmates, the prison system still struggles to deliver an effective service.
That's according to the Criminal Justice Inspection, which claims that the system is still operating as it did during the Troubles, when the focus was more on security than rehabilitation, with inmates locked up for long periods of time.
In an editorial, the paper says that our jails need reform from top to bottom.
It calls on Justice Minister David Ford to "address the fundamental flaws in the service, ensuring that the right people are at the helm, and that the prison warders' union no longer exerts undue influence on the prison regime".
Wikileaks cable claims about the Northern Bank robbery are still very much to the fore.
The News Letter reports that unionist politicians - such as Gregory Campbell and David McNarry - have called on Sinn Fein leaders to "come clean" about the allegations, while the Mirror leads with Gerry Adams' insistence that he had no prior knowledge of the Â£26.5m bank raid.
The Mirror's editorial says the Americans are squirming, as what they say in public seems to bear little resemblance to what's said behind closed doors.
But it says that all the embarrassment will be worth it, if it helps us to get closer to the truth about the Northern Bank robbery, and also about the murder of Pat Finucane.
The Irish News reports that RTE Digital is coming north.
Northern Ireland is going to get RTE through Freeview.
It is part of a groundbreaking deal which is also expected to include greater access of BBC services south of the border.
The move follows a memorandum of understanding between the British and Irish governments earlier this year.
"Bring it on," says the paper's editorial. "It's right that viewers here should be able to access RTE as easily as BBC or UTV."
There are more questions about the Stockholm suicide bomber in several English papers.
According to the bomber's family, it was his stay in Britain, in Luton, that turned him from an ordinary teenager to an al-Qaeda fanatic.
The Independent asks why Luton has become "the epicentre of the global clash of civilisations".
The Daily Telegraph thinks it has the answer, describing the town as 'a hotbed of extremism" which has "featured in a significant proportion of British terrorism plots over the past decade".
The Times says that it could be to do with the decline of Luton's car-making industry which left the town with "a combustible atmosphere, racial tensions, high unemployment and the highest crime rate in the region".
And finally the Daily Telegraph goes out on a limb and insists that a white Christmas is now a virtual certainty, with a second big freeze on its way.
The Daily Express is already dreaming about it - it says that snow may bring havoc, but "who could deny that a carpet of white on the back lawn is a perfect accompaniment to Christmas lunch?"
Meanwhile, back with the Telegraph, there's news of a couple for whom summer never ends.

article The meeting of cousins Taulupe Faletau of Wales and England's Billy Vunipola is being touted as one of the key confrontations at Twickenham.
Wales captain Warburton agrees with that assessment.
"If either has a very good game it's going to go a long way towards that team winning the match," he said.
Wales coach Warren Gatland has called the game a cup final which will probably decide the tournament.
England are top of the table after winning their first three games and are up against a Welsh side who are also unbeaten after recording two wins and a draw.
Vunipola's performances have been a key factor in England's success, and he is the leading ball carrier in the tournament.
Wales' success has been built on an unyielding defence in which Faletau has been an outstanding figure.
"Toby's one of the best players I've played with," added Warburton.
"He's gifted in the sense that he can do everything. I don't think anyone could find an attribute that he can't do on the field.
"I think that's going to be a massive battle between those two number eights.
"Billy's been a class act for the past three matches and I've always been impressed with him when I've watched him for Saracens and he's always been one of England's go-to players."
Wales second row Alun Wyn Jones, who will make his 98th appearance for Wales at Twickenham, agrees that Gatland's side will have to contain Vunipola.
"Very much so, and hopefully they'll be thinking the same about Toby," he said.
"It's one of the battles within the game.
"Both players are in a fine burst of form, but probably Billy's been the stand out eight in the competition thus far, no disrespect to Toby, I think everyone would agree with that.
"Billy's been the talisman in their pack, he's given them go-forward off the back of a good set piece but also linking up wide with their backline because he's having a bit more licence to play wide and he's been effective doing that."

article The English League One club are understood to have offered £100,000 up front, with add-ons which could have taken the deal to £200,000.
But Kilmarnock's board rejected what Charlton have indicated will be their final offer for the 25-year-old, who is in the final year of his contract.
"It is fantastic news for me," said Lee Clark after their loss to Motherwell.
The manager told BBC Scotland: "Josh was honest enough to say he didn't feel right for today's game, and when you have a player of his quality out of the squad, it has a big effect.
"The board has spoken to Josh, who has said that if the club have turned down the offer, he will give everything for as long as he is here.  Whether that is until the end of the August window, or the end of his contract, we will see.
"But I am hoping to have him in the group next week for the Hamilton game."

article Southampton defender Stephens smashed in on his home ground to bring up a 27th home win in a row for Aidy Boothroyd's side.
England had not beaten Italy at this level since 1997 but were deserved winners in an entertaining game.
Leicester's Demarai Gray and Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker also scored.
England's last defeat came against Italy in June 2015, which ended their European Championship campaign.
Both sides have qualified for the U21 Euro 2017 tournament, which will be held in Poland next summer.
England took the lead when John Swift's cut back was stabbed clear but only to Gray, who side-footed home.
Italy levelled when Swift gave the ball away, Andrea Conti ran at Brendan Galloway and his cross was deflected up over Angus Gunn and in.
Federico di Francesco then tapped Italy ahead from a corner before Baker hit a low equaliser after a one-two with Will Hughes.
And in stoppage time Stephens converted after Calum Chambers' header was pushed out.
Interim England Under-21 manager Aidy Boothroyd:
"We have managed to qualify six times on the spin, what we have to do now is do as well at the tournament. That's the holy grail, isn't it?
"If we can do that then we will be in a good place.
"We learnt a lot about ourselves. We learnt we have plenty of character and can score goals from all over the pitch. We hit the crossbar and the post and we had an appeal for a penalty we thought we should have had (when Demarai Gray went down in the first half).
"I'm not saying it was all rosy because it wasn't; we showed there are a lot of things we still need to work on defensively, but overall we are delighted to play such a major nation and get a result like that."

article Starc took pain-killing injections for an ankle injury during last week's first-Test in Cardiff.
The 25-year-old took seven wickets and batted for an hour in the fourth innings of the 169-run loss to England.
And Clarke says Starc has reacted "positively" to treatment ahead of the start of the second Test on Thursday.
"Spending a bit of time with the Australian physio, he's confident that, although it's a short turnaround before the second test, there's been a lot of positives that have come out of the last couple of days since he was cortisoned, and things are going really well there," Clarke told Melbourne radio station Triple M.
"Starcy obviously had some ankle pain and had an injection to bowl in the second innings, but the positive again was the fact he was able to bowl and do what was needed for the team.
"He batted as well in the second innings and ran between the wickets fine.
Should Starc, who was named player of the tournament at this year's World Cup, fail to prove his fitness, Australia have Peter Siddle or Pat Cummins in reserve.
Australia have already suffered one significant bowling injury during this tour, with Ryan Harris withdrawing and subsequently retiring from the game because of a knee problem.
England have named an unchanged 13-man squad for Lord's.

article Gallacher, 41, has had a troublesome hand injury for more than a year.
The Scot has had an operation and a number of injections to try to eliminate the problem.
"When the surgeon says, 'if you keep swinging the club like this then you may not be playing in later life,' I thought it is time to change," he said.
"I have played a certain way in the wind for years and have to change it and try to remember it.
"If I don't change it, then I am going to be injured again and it may be career-threatening, so it is easy to do if that is put in front of you."
Gallacher has not played since missing the cut at the Nordea Masters in early June but returns at this week's Paul Lawrie Match Play event at Archerfield in East Lothian.
He believes it is the perfect event for his return as he eases his way back into regular play on the tour.
"I think staying at home and playing a course I know well with family here is great," he told BBC Scotland.
"It's a great format and one that's going to be fun and you just hope that you are going to be good enough to do well on the day to progress."
Gallacher, who faces Italian Renato Paratore in round one, is one of seven Scots in the 64-strong field with host Paul Lawrie, Scott Jamieson, Marc Warren, David Drysdale, Craig Lee and Richie Ramsay also competing.
Among the favourites for the event is England's Chris Wood, who is close to securing his place in the European Ryder Cup team that heads to Hazeltine in September to take on the USA.
Wood leapt up the Ryder Cup rankings by winning the PGA Championship at Wentworth in May.
Now ranked as world number 25, Wood says his target for the season has always been to be in contention for selection in Darren Clarke's team.
"I always had a goal of giving myself a chance to make the team," explained Wood.
"No pressure if I don't qualify, I just want to put myself in contention. Since the win I have been well in [the automatic picks]. I have also put in some solid performances since.
"I certainly feel like I have earned the spot if I get it but obviously I want to finish the qualifying well as well.
"I love team stuff. I played a lot of football when I was younger, a centre forward scoring all the goals.
"The Ryder Cup is obviously so unique it's one of the only times you get the feel for that sort of environment again and I thrive on that sort of stuff."

article Peter Burkett, 24, was one of the 96 Liverpool fans who were fatally crushed in the crowd.
He told another fan that it was "murder" on the terraces as he walked away from the central pens.
The court also heard details of 19-year-old Colin Wafer's final movements.
The men were all standing in the Leppings Lane end of the stadium to watch Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final match against Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
Mr Burkett travelled to the match with Jonathan Owens - who also died - and Michael Robertson.
Another fan, Anthony Turner, also spoke to Mr Burkett at the match.
Mr Robertson said, after entering the terraces, the three of them became separated. He moved to the right to try to get away from "all the pushing" but his friends did not follow.
But he said they were "kind of pushed down the flood of people coming in".
The next time he saw Mr Burkett was when he was lying in the recovery position on the pitch.
The jury heard Mr Turner had "bumped into" Mr Burkett as he was walking back through the tunnel leading into the central pens.
Mr Turner said: "He basically said it was very bad. I think he said 'it's murder in there', or words to that effect.
"Basically it was a case of he was coming out because it was so bad."
Mr Turner said the two of them walked back up to the mouth of the tunnel, spoke to a man they believed to be a steward and asked if there was another way into the ground.
He told the inquests: "He pointed back down the tunnel and said 'just go in that way', as if that was the normal way to go in.
BBC News: Profiles of all those who died
"I got the impression that it was as if he had been asked the same question again and again and he was like 'just go back down there'."
Mr Turner said he was not "100% comfortable" with going back that way but did so "with a certain amount of trust that that's the way to go".
He said they were "following the direction and advice" of the steward.
Mr Turner said they were soon "trapped" by other Liverpool fans who had also gone down the tunnel.
Once on the terraces they tried to stay together but were split up "pretty much immediately". Mr Turner said that "there was no way that we could stay together".
He continued: "[Mr Burkett] just looked around with a shrug and a half smile. He just looked at me and he said 'see you later' or words to that effect."
The jury saw video footage timed at 15:19 BST - 19 minutes after kick-off - which showed Mr Burkett lying among other fans who had been caught in the crush.
Andrew Barlow, a South Yorkshire Police officer at the time, was among several people who helped carry Mr Burkett.
A doctor assessed him at the stadium's gymnasium, which was used as a temporary mortuary, and confirmed he had died.
The jury also heard about the final movements of 19-year-old Colin Wafer, a Liverpool bank clerk described by his family as "as lively and bright as his red hair".
The court was told there is no evidence about his journey to the stadium or how he got inside, but police found an unused ticket for the match among his possessions.
He was seen entering the Leppings Lane terraces at about 14:51.
Footage timed at 15:17 showed Mr Wafer lying towards the front of a section of the terraces known as pen three after the crush.
In pictures from 15:19, Liverpool fan Steven Allen was seen helping police pull him out of the pen on to the pitch.
Mr Allen, who was an officer in the Metropolitan Police, said he believed Mr Wafer was dead when he carried him.
Two female officers tried to resuscitate him on the pitch, but stopped after a St John Ambulance volunteer told them he had died.
One of the constables, Glenda Wood, then placed an anorak over Mr Wafer's face "out of respect".
He was later carried on a makeshift stretcher towards the stadium's gymnasium at about 15:30. A doctor there confirmed he had died.
Mr Wafer's brother, Ian Wafer, formally identified his body at 01:30 the following morning.
The inquests, sitting in Warrington, Cheshire, are due to resume on Wednesday.

The in-form striker was set up for a close-range finish by Gary Harkins after 86 minutes.
Ross Draper had given the visitors an early lead, rounding goalkeeper Scott Bain to finish.
Dundee dominated the second half, creating a series of good chances before the late equaliser.
In a congested mid-table, Caley Thistle were four minutes away from leapfrogging their hosts but remain in seventh place, two points behind the Dark Blues.
The Highlanders had started impressively, finding their rhythm and passing the ball crisply and accurately. Their composure was unsettling for Dundee, who spent the opening period trying to hold their defensive shape.
The visitors built much of their attacking play around Jordan Roberts, who was strong but also nimble and assured at centre-forward. By dropping off the front-line, he also joined in the build-up play and it was that versatility that led to the opening goal.
From a deep position, Roberts saw the run of Draper from deep and threaded a pass for the midfielder to collect before knocking the ball beyond Bain and knocking it into an empty net.
The home players and fans claimed for offside, in vain, and discontent grew with the performance of the officials.
The Dundee supporters spent most of the first-half booing Carl Tremarco after the Inverness full-back appeared to kick out at Greg Stewart as the pair tangled on the ground following a tackle.
Referee Andrew Dallas booked both players for the scuffle and had to keep his yellow card close to hand as he tried to manage a lively encounter.
Despite their strength in attack, Dundee struggled to create a clear chance in the first half, and the closest they came was a Stewart effort from distance that flew past.
There was a further set-back for Paul Hartley's side when defender Darren O'Dea went down injured on the cusp of half-time and failed to reappear after the interval.
Dundee were much more effective in the second period and Stewart should have equalised when the ball ran to him inside the area, but he shot wide from 10 yards out.
Rory Loy had a similar chance soon after, when he picked his way into space only for his shot to cannon off the leg of Owain Fon-Williams, the Inverness goalkeeper.
All three of the strikers were frustrated, with Hemmings blasting a volley over from Harkins' pinpoint cross-field pass.
Having been booked in the first-half for time-wasting, Fon-Williams barely had a moment's respite. His sharpness in racing off his goal-line after Gary Warren's miscued header flew straight to Stewart, prevented an equaliser, since the striker's effort flew straight into the keeper's body.
It looked then as if Dundee were going to be thwarted, but a striker as prolific as Hemmings only needs half a chance and he took his when Harkins headed a corner back across goal. Hemmings was first to react and he steered the ball home.

article Across Northern Ireland and France, ceremonies will take place to mark the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.
Thousands of soldiers from across Ireland were killed at the Somme, including more than 2,000 from the 36th Ulster Division on the first day of the battle.
One man who will be making the journey to the battlefield is William Sayers. His relative, Samuel Sayers, died on the western front a few weeks before the battle began in May 1916.
The eerie and evocative sound of the lone bugler comes from his lips as we stand together outside the rural Donemana home where the private from the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers lived, 100 years ago.
"The most synonymous thing is that the field you look onto is actually where he got some of his friends, young farmers in the area, to take up the call and train on," William said.
"He taught them how to crawl on their bellies and to give them some realisation of what they were to expect in the battlefields of the Somme.
"He had a .303 rifle and he got pieces of wood and made a template of the gun and gave them to the men in the field.
"That was so that they would understand the length of the rifle they were using, it was very much forward thinking."
William said his distant relative was very ambitious and wanted to succeed in the army and do well in World War One.
"You can imagine that back then food was scarce, money was scarce. They were promised so much.
"They were told that this would be the better lifestyle, they would come back great men and his intention was to come back a captain."
As far as his family know, Samuel went out in 1914 to fight in the war, but returned home for a short period of time.
On his next stint at the front, he was killed on 17 May 1916.
He was buried outside an army field hospital near the Ulster Tower.
He died as Private Sayers, never making it to his much coveted rank of Captain.
"He was a distant relative but again he was a man from our townland and whether he was a relative or not we're still going to remember him," William said.
"Ten years ago we went out to his grave, the first people ever to visit his grave, and I would just like to leave it that his sacrifice would never be forgotten."
"I tried to imagine myself as the young man Samuel Sayers, leaving here, with the local band marching him to the train station.
"To think that some day you would be in the trenches and the next time you hear a whistle blow over the top it could be all over in a second."
William told me he plans to play the melancholic Last Post over Samuel's grave in a personal tribute to his sacrifice.
"We're going to have an act of remembrance at his grave, my father will put a poppy into his grave and then we'll do the Last Post.
"It's moving in many ways, moving in many ways."

article The seat has been left vacant following the death of long-serving Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman in February.
Labour, who chose North West MEP Afzal Khan to stand in the by-election, are being challenged by the former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway.
Voting will take place on the same day as the Greater Manchester mayoral elections.
Labour's chief whip Nicholas Brown moved a writ in the House of Commons on Tuesday to trigger the by-election which was then approved by MPs.
Lisa Nandy, who is coordinating Labour's campaign, told a meeting of the party's MPs at Westminster on Monday that they were "confident but not complacent" about holding Gorton.
Manchester Gorton has been a Labour seat since 1935. Sir Gerald held it with a majority of 24,079 at the 2015 general election, winning 67% of the total vote.
Sir Gerald, who was the longest-serving MP in Westminster, died aged 86 after serving the constituency for over 30 years.
The Green Party has chosen 36-year-old entrepreneur Jess Mayo as their candidate.
The Lib Dems, who came fifth last time, have selected Jackie Pearcey.
The Conservatives and UKIP, who came third and fourth respectively in 2015, are yet to announce their candidates.
George Galloway announced last week he would stand as an independent candidate.

article The children, starting as young as six years old, come each week to this out-of-school private learning centre in Hong Kong.
They are getting lessons in computer coding not always available within Hong Kong's state schools, with parents paying extra for skills that they hope will keep up with a fast-moving digital industry.
Over the next hour-and-a-half, they are taught how to create characters for a simple mobile game, using "drag and drop" software.
"It's a form of coding," says Michelle Sun, the 28-year-old founder of this coding school, called First Code Academy.
"This way, the kids don't have to type as much. It's much more intuitive for them to learn the concepts and build a foundation."
Later they will begin to learn JavaScript, a programming language that underpins many internet applications.

She sometimes struggles to catch the attention of her young students, some of whom are glued to their screens.
The atmosphere in class is noisy, boisterous and interactive. But she has an easy rapport with the children.
Born and raised in Hong Kong, Ms Sun attended an elite girls' school, succeeding in the city's notoriously regimented, competitive education system.
She was then exposed to western influences, studying at the University of Chicago and then working in California, before returning home to start a coding school.
"When I was growing up, it was about taking in new knowledge and making sure we understand it in tests. But in the information age we are in now, the role of education is different," she says.
Her own experience in Silicon Valley convinced her that there were booming opportunities available to those with programming skills, especially for mobile software.
According to estimates from Juniper Research, the global market for mobile applications will more than double from $47.7bn (Â£30.8bn) in 2014 to $99bn (Â£64bn) in 2019.
Asia, bolstered by strong growth in China, is expected to account for more than half of that market.
Hong Kong is already one of the world's most wired cities. According to government figures, 85% of homes have access to broadband, and people own, on average, at least two mobile phones.
But the education system - while world class according to global tests -  has not been keeping pace with the speed of change in the digital age.
Computer literacy is commonly taught, but computer programming receives far less attention in classrooms, according to teachers.
A syllabus from the Education Bureau that sets out requirements for junior secondary school students in computer literacy was last updated in 1999.
It exposes students to educational programming which is now considered by many to be outdated.
The students at First Code come from families that can afford fees of between $775 to $1,300 per 12-week term, depending on the age of the child.
That is out of the reach of many people here, as the median monthly household income last year was about $3,000.
To bridge the digital divide, the Hong Kong government aims to make computer programming a required subject for students as young as 11 years old.
"What we want to do is to incorporate coding as a mandatory part of early secondary education so as to equip students for the future digital world," said Joey Lam, Hong Kong's deputy government chief information officer.
She declined to give a specific starting date, but said it would happen within a few years.
Other countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and Singapore, are also working out when and how to start compulsory education in computer programming.
Last September, a new national curriculum was introduced in England, requiring students age five onwards to be taught the basics of programming.
Estonia had started the trend a few years earlier by introducing programming in primary schools.
In Hong Kong, private schools and study centres like First Code are filling in the gap.
As for the children who meet on Fridays, they may only be working on basic mobile games now, but they may in he long run be getting one step ahead of the game.

article But we've got it wrong, and contrary to our expectations, we could actually learn from psychopaths, argues Oxford University experimental psychologist Kevin Dutton.
"It's true, when psychologists like myself use the word psychopath, images of killers like Ted Bundy go flashing across most people's minds," he says.
However, he argues that we could all benefit from sometimes being more ruthless, fearless, self-confident, focused, mentally tough, charming or charismatic - all of which are traits of a psychopath.
None of these is a problem in itself, he says, the danger comes when "all these traits are turned up too high, and that's when you start getting individuals who are dysfunctional".
"I am not glamorising violent criminal psychopaths," Prof Dutton points out, "because these guys completely devastate other people's lives."
In his new book, The Wisdom of Psychopaths, he says that adopting certain psychopathic characteristics can help us improve our own performance in the workplace.
Psychopaths tend not to procrastinate or take things personally, "and they don't beat themselves up when things go wrong", he says.
"If you're putting in for a rise, you might feel a little anxious about doing that - what would happen if I don't get it, what would my boss think about me?
"Well, just have the courage of your convictions and go for it. Don't focus on the negatives, focus on the positives.
"By doing that it makes you more confident, and more likely to get what you want in the first place."
Even a lack of empathy with others - common among psychopaths - can be useful in certain jobs.
Source: Kevin Dutton, author of The Wisdom of Psychopaths
"Imagine you've the skill set to be a great surgeon - but can't dissociate yourself emotionally from the person you're operating on," says Prof Dutton.
"One surgeon told me that as soon as you start thinking of that person as someone's wife or husband, you're beginning to walk an emotional tightrope.
"That's where dissociating yourself from people can predispose you to success."
People with these kinds of characteristics are often suited to any number of high profile roles, he argues - such as chief executives, lawyers or even journalists.
Politicians too, can often exhibit certain psychopathic traits.
"Successful politicians need to be remorseless at implementing policies in the face of opposition," says Prof Dutton.
"If you think of it, the most successful politician is someone who says what most people are thinking.
"They are brilliant at slipping into people's air space, they are psychopathic cat burglars."
However, some other psychologists counter that psychopaths only account for about 1% of the general population, and to define them as Kevin Dutton does is too broad.
"It is wrong to describe these people as psychopaths - that's a clinical definition," says Prof Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University Management School.
"They are not going to kill anybody - but indirectly they can damage people because they are so focused on their own success and totally oblivious to the needs of others.
"It is basically an abrasive, bullying management style."
Yet setting aside the question of how psychopaths should be defined, Jonny Gifford, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees with Prof Dutton that we can learn from these behaviour traits.
"Many of us don't like organisational politics, but we need to be realistic, to recognise that sometimes there is a need to be politically wily.
"Sometimes there is a need to be tough. We just need to do that in a way which maintains integrity and is ethical."
Of course, the trick is knowing what is ethical in the first place.
"It's all very well saying you should work to your own values - but your values may stink," says Gifford.

How important is  charismatic leadership at the top of a company?

While those who are out only for themselves and not for their colleagues may bring short-term gains, in the long run they can prove problematic for organisations.
"They do very well, but the team suffers," says Jonny Gifford at the CIPD.
It is important to realise that there will always be cut-throat people within organisations, he says. From a company's point of view, the trick is to control this type of behaviour, to rein in some people so they don't damage the firm by their actions.
For his part, Kevin Dutton says that sometimes ruthlessness and a lack of empathy is exactly what a manager needs to run a big company.
"Imagine if you've got the strategic and financial nous to be a top businessman but you lack the ruthlessness to fire people who aren't pulling their weight, or the coolness under pressure to ride out a storm, you're never going to be a top captain of industry, are you?"
But for those who think they may have a boss with out-of-control psychopathic tendencies, he has this advice.
"If your boss has a tendency to step on those beneath him but goes out of his way to impress those above him - it's time to move."

He said: "There are opportunities for a dual-warranted individual... to carry out the functions of customs and policing providing the necessary training is in place.
"[We're] exploring all the options to make sure it's cost effective policing in Sark, but it's also fit for a modern day society."

article Portsmouth City Council has put up new road signs after a six-month campaign against an enforcement camera near the Queen Alexandra Hospital.
Patients and visitors were fined more than £10,000 a week and argued signs around Cavell Drive were easy to miss.
Campaigner Andrew Peryer was fined two days after his wife's death.
The camera was set up in July last year and regularly caught out drivers using the bus lane.
The campaign began after Mr Peryer was sent a picture of him and terminally-ill wife Wendy, 53, using the bus lane, and a £60 fine after she died from cancer.
He said: "It was quite a shock to have that through the post. I really wanted to make sure it wasn't going to happen again to someone who was unsuspecting."
Mr Peryer confronted the council and said warning signs were partially hidden by a bus shelter and other billboards and drivers were "genuinely making a mistake".
Portsmouth City Council argued the signs complied with legal requirements, but six months on the authority has taken action.
Council figures previously revealed the enforcement camera amassed fines totalling £123,000 within 11 weeks of it being installed.
A further 1,453 tickets had been issued since November, bringing the total fines to more than £210,000.
Councillor Jim Fleming, cabinet member for traffic and transportation, said: "We listened to resident feedback and have made some updates which we hope will address the confusion that some people experiences."
Mr Peryer said it was a "great result" and the signage was "as it should be".
Portsmouth North MP Penny Mordaunt also backed the campaign and said the council should now review any "high-income" sights for driving fines.

"So I've prepared myself as much as possible for a competitor like Serena."
Konta beat Russian 30th seed Ekaterina Makarova 6-1 6-4 to reach the last eight without dropping a set.
She has a 2-1 winning record over Serena's sister Venus - a nine-time Grand Slam winner and former world number one - including a first-round victory at last year's Australian Open.

It will be Konta's second quarter-final at a Grand Slam, after reaching the semi-final in Melbourne last year, compared to 35-year-old Serena's 47th.
"I've been fortunate enough that I've played her sister a few times and I think she's just as incredible," said Konta.
"I was thinking I'd love the opportunity to be on court with her before she retires. But I doubt she's talking retirement.
"She will be playing until the very last ball she can physically hit. Hopefully it won't be the last time I play her before she retires."
Serena, in pursuit of her seventh Australian Open title, had only played two matches between the end of the US Open in August and her first-round victory in Melbourne.
Konta, meanwhile, remained busy on tour and took her world ranking from 49 at the end of 2015 to a career-high of nine.
"I watch her game a lot. She's been doing really, really well, She has a very attacking game and I look forward to it," said Serena.
"I have absolutely nothing to lose in this tournament. Everything here is a bonus for me. Obviously I am here to win, and hopefully I can play better."

article The plight of the double world champion, who some still consider the best driver in the world, was illustrated perfectly over the course of the Belgian Grand Prix weekend - both on track and off.
On the circuit, there was evidence of the best and worst of this complex man. Off it, the McLaren driver's future was one of the key topics.
Essentially, Alonso has found himself in an awkward catch-22 situation, the core of the issue being whether the 36-year-old will even be in Formula 1 next year.
He has lost faith in engine supplier Honda - as the Japanese company's F1 boss admitted to BBC Sport last weekend - but if the team are still using their engines next year, his other options appear limited in the extreme.
McLaren are trying to get out of their Honda contract but are finding it difficult to do so.
"We will see what happens in the next couple of weeks," Alonso said after Sunday's race.
"I am happy with the team. We are having difficult seasons in the last three years but McLaren is one of the best teams in the world. I would be happy to keep working with them but we need to see how things evolve in the next couple of weeks."
Over three days of track action, the Belgian Grand Prix provided a perfect microcosm of the situation in which Alonso and McLaren find themselves.
Their other driver, Stoffel Vandoorne, was hit with 55 places of grid penalties over the weekend for using far beyond the permitted number of engine parts this season.
The first half of the penalty came when an upgraded engine was fitted before the weekend, the second half when that engine developed a problem on Friday and had to be replaced.
Alonso, meanwhile, was surprisingly competitive - in relative terms - at Spa, which is behind only Monza in terms of the influence of engine power on lap time.
He was contending for a position in the top-10 qualifying shootout - thanks to help from 'tows' from Vandoorne to minimise the Honda's deficit on the straights - and would have got it had he not suffered a bizarre engine-related issue on his final run in the second knockout session.
The Honda failed to deploy its hybrid power boost after the fast Pouhon double left-hander because of a programming error in the electronics.
On that lap, Alonso took Pouhon flat out for the first time - something the Ferrari drivers managed but the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers did not, albeit all of them arriving at the corner faster. The problem was the Honda electronics were judging track position - and therefore where to deploy electrical energy - partly by throttle action. As Alonso had not lifted the accelerator, the system did not realise he had taken the corner so did not deploy after it.
In the circumstances, his anguished cries of "no power, no power" were understandable.
For the race, Alonso was promoted to 10th on the grid by a five-place penalty for Renault's Jolyon Palmer, and made one of his trademark brilliant starts to be seventh on the first lap.
Then the inevitable happened - he started to be picked off on the straight by other cars with much more power than his Honda, which sources say is about 80bhp down on a customer Mercedes engine.
This led to a series of grumpy radio messages from Alonso, as he allowed his frustration to show.
By lap 24, he was down to 12th, out of the points and with no prospect of scoring any. He asked if any rain was on the horizon to give him hope, was told no, and a lap later reported an engine problem and pulled into the pits to retire.
Honda says it has found no evidence of any problems on the data. McLaren are not commenting beyond what they said on Sunday - that Alonso retired because he felt an engine problem.
Some believe he 'parked it' - retired a healthy car. This is normally a cardinal sin in F1, where everyone's default position is the driver races as hard as he can until such time as he can no longer, either because the race finishes, he crashes or the car develops a problem.
If he did, it may not be the first time this season - some believe he did the same with a couple of laps to go in Bahrain in April, when he was similarly out of the points after a frustrating race.
Alonso denied this, and will almost certainly do the same if he is asked about Spa. So people are left to draw their own conclusions.
Whether Alonso did or did not 'park it', it has not changed McLaren's desire to keep him in 2018. They continue to refer to persuading Alonso to stay as a "priority".
As such, it seems that whether what happened in Belgium was restricted to a few mardy radio messages, or whether Alonso stopped racing out of sheer frustration and anger, McLaren are regarding it as a reflection of where he is at.
If that sounds surprising, it's perhaps because McLaren are in the same place. After three years of terrible performance and awful reliability, the team's leaders are at their wits' end with Honda.
Again, they are not commenting directly on the issue publicly, but their attitude to the engine they would like to use next year can best be summed up as ABH - anyone but Honda.
This saga started back in March, when the exact scale of the problems Honda had with its new engine first became apparent in pre-season testing.
After a redesign over the winter, the new Honda showed dreadful performance and reliability in testing and McLaren began looking around for an alternative.
First, they approached Mercedes. Initial signs were encouraging. Sources say there was a gentlemen's agreement between McLaren shareholder Mansour Ojjeh and Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche.
But Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff was never keen and that deal has now collapsed.
Ferrari have also said no, so that leaves Renault.
On the face of it, swapping the worst engine in F1 for the second worst, and waving goodbye to a net $100m (£77m) in financial contribution to the team in the process seems an odd decision, but McLaren's bosses believe it makes sense.
They are finding it difficult to source sponsorship with their current performance, and Honda's failings are also costing them constructors' points.
McLaren are ninth in the standings. But they know from GPS traces that their car's cornering ability is one of the best on the grid and they believe that with a Renault engine they would be able to challenge Red Bull for third overall.
Even if they finished fourth, the difference between that and ninth is about £15m. If it was third, that number goes up to £30m. A customer Renault engine would cost in the region of £18m.
McLaren produced poor cars when they had Mercedes engines in 2013 and '14 so it is especially frustrating to have sorted out their design department only to find themselves handicapped by their engine.
The idea is to get themselves into a reasonably competitive position by 2021, when F1's engine formula will be simplified and a number of other options may be available - perhaps even making their own engine.

Then there is the cost of losing Alonso. Yes, his $40m (£31m) salary is expensive, but if he left and McLaren were forced to stick with Honda engines, the ramifications are large.
First of all, there are few alternatives available. McLaren are interested in Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz as a back-up. But he is not contractually free, Red Bull would want money to release him, and he is no Alonso anyway. There are very few appealing alternatives, and none anywhere near Alonso's ability.
Look back over the past three years with Honda and it is clear to see that without Alonso, McLaren would look far worse than they already do.
He is the one who has scored their best finishes, who does remarkable things like qualifying seventh in Spain, who routinely makes sensational starts and puts the car in places it has no right to be.
When he finished sixth in Hungary, Vandoorne was 10th. This year, his average qualifying position is 12.3; Vandoorne's is 14.8. Last year Alonso's was 11.7; Jenson Button's 12.6.
He also provides a level for the car - the team always know where it is competitively, because they know he will always find its limit. There are hardly any other drivers - arguably none - about whom you can say that.
Without Alonso, despite all his baggage, things would look even less rosy than they do now. And that's without even thinking about how much harder it would be to attract sponsors.
McLaren's problem is that dropping Honda is proving difficult. For a start, Honda do not want to go. And F1's senior figures want Honda to stay in the sport. On top of that, the rules forbid manufacturers supplying more than three teams without special dispensation from the FIA.
So if McLaren are going to get Renault engines, they either have to force Honda into a position where it wants to quit - whereby someone else would have to supply them - or cut a deal.
McLaren's current plan is for Toro Rosso to take the Hondas, and McLaren to get the Renaults used by Red Bull's junior team.
Red Bull and Renault are open to this. Red Bull's strategy is to run the Honda with Toro Rosso, then if Honda gets its act together, switch the supply to Red Bull as well and become their works partner.
On the face of it, that's a win-win for Honda - they end a fractured relationship with McLaren, move to a team where the pressure and focus is not anywhere near as great, remove the difficulties created by Alonso's status and personality, and get the chance long-term to move to a team that will offer them at least as much potential as McLaren do.
But it seems Honda does not see it that way, and is proving intransigent. And, right now, the most likely scenario appears to be McLaren continuing with Honda.
Time is running out. There is a new development Honda engine being introduced for this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, which will mean more grid penalties and another frustrating weekend.
On past history, it is unlikely to be a major step forward and so is equally unlikely to change Alonso's mind on Honda.
But he has few other options. The top three teams are locked up and not interested in him. Williams have talked to him, but they are badly struggling at the moment and that would surely be out of the frying pan into the fire.
Renault? There is a seat there alongside Nico Hulkenberg but it would require Alonso to climb down massively on his salary demands and for what? They are nowhere near ready to win either.
IndyCar? Alonso's enthusiasm for a full season there is probably well under control, but he would love to win the Indy 500, after his stellar debut there this year. And there is a seat open at the Andretti team, whom he drove for in May.
Or what about swallowing his pride and sticking with McLaren, even if they are still with Honda, hope Honda can improve in the second year of this engine design, and do a deal whereby he could at least do the Indy 500 if the car was uncompetitive again?
"We will consider all the options," he said on Sunday. "But we did a fantastic qualifying and a fantastic start.
"We won a lot of grands prix, a lot of things in our career and we should not be that far back."

article Audit Scotland has reviewed how the Scottish government and its agencies handle ICT, and found it suffers from a lack of civil service expertise.
The report updates progress since 2012.
It covers Registers of Scotland, the Crown Office, the Procurator Fiscal service and Disclosure Scotland.
It found that the Scottish government introduced an assurance framework two years ago, but it was not clear enough, and the Scottish government "did not oversee its implementation effectively".
There are now revised arrangements and the watchdog believes these need careful management and strong leadership. It was only last August that the Scottish government sought to find out the scale of its ICT skills gap.
In 2013, the 21 largest Scottish government bodies spent Â£739m on suppliers of ICT-related goods and services.  The spend had increased 15% since 2011, as government extended online access to services, partly to improve efficiency.
Caroline Gardner, Auditor General for Scotland, said: "When managed effectively, ICT programmes have the power to transform public services, and make a real and positive difference to people's lives.
"However, the difficulties in managing ICT programmes in both the public and private sector are well documented, and remain a complex challenge for the Scottish government and central government bodies. While steps have been taken to improve, and overcome obstacles such as the shortage of ICT skills in the public sector, today's report shows that significant progress is still needed.
"Our recommendations reflect the continuing work by the Scottish government and central government bodies and are intended to help them achieve the full benefits of effective ICT, particularly in this time of reducing budgets and increasing demand for public services."
A Scottish government spokesman, responding to the report, said: "We welcome that Audit Scotland's report recognises a substantial proportion of their recommendations have already been implemented and that further work is under way.
"We will continue to drive forward reform in the delivery of public services in Scotland, building on our solid reputation for effectiveness and efficiency.
"The Scottish government is committed to continuing joint working across central government to further improve ICT programme delivery, which is helping us deliver tangible improvements in public services."

article The deal includes a 100MW development at the Ness of Duncansby in the Pentland Firth and a 10MW project at the Sound of Islay in western Scotland.
The projects were acquired by Atlantis's development vehicle, Tidal Power Scotland Limited (TPSL).
In exchange, SPR has gained a 6% shareholding in TPSL.
The project assets include lease agreements with The Crown Estate for both sites, while the Sound of Islay development also has a grid connection offer and construction consents from Scottish ministers.
Atlantis said the two projects would sit alongside its flagship 398MW MeyGen tidal energy scheme in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, which separates the north Caithness coast and Orkney.
The firm eventually plans to have up to 269 turbines installed on the seabed there.
Earlier this year, Atlantis bought Marine Current Turbines from Siemens AG, providing it with lease agreements for two further Scottish tidal sites - at the Mull of Galloway in south-west Scotland and Brough Ness, to the north of the MeyGen and Ness of Duncansby sites.
Atlantis is in the process of adding these two projects, with a combined capacity of 130MW, to the TPSL portfolio.
By 2022, the company aims to have at least 640MW of installed capacity in the UK through developing its existing portfolio.
Atlantis chief executive Tim Cornelius said: "The UK is now synonymous with tidal power in the same way tech is with Silicon Valley.
"Thanks to the dedicated support provided by the Department for Energy and Climate Change and the Scottish government, the UK tidal sector is leading the world.
"In a transformational 12 months, we have increased our UK projects portfolio by almost 80% in terms of potential capacity, through the acquisition of Marine Current Turbines from Siemens, and this transaction with SPR."
ScottishPower Renewables chief executive Keith Anderson said: "The MeyGen project has moved the tidal power sector forward in Scotland and Atlantis is now the world's leading developer.
"This agreement will drive momentum in the sector."
In a separate development, Orkney-based Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd announced it had secured a further Â£5.7m from investors to allow it to demonstrate the world's largest tidal turbine.
The company is close to completing the construction of its SR2000 (2MW) system in the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
The machine is due to be launched early next year before being towed to the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney to commence grid-connected testing.
The latest funding was provided by existing shareholders - including ABB, Total New Energies, Bonheur ASA and Ganger Rolf ASA - as well as new stakeholders DP Energy, Harland and Wolff and Scotmarine.

"I walked on the stage and I opened my mouth to sing Goldfinger," she said. "Nothing came out."
Samantha Novak, 21, was found face down in the River Avon, near the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol, in 1985.
Dame Shirley has always maintained that her daughter's death was not an accident or suicide.
In a programme to be shown on BBC One on Christmas Eve, the singer can be seen telling David Walliams that the loss was "just devastating".
She said she decided to perform because she "didn't know what to do with herself" and that being at home was "killing" her.
The 79-year-old now accepts she should have been "staying home and grieving and getting it out my system" instead of expressing her feelings on stage.
The singer paid tribute to a vocal coach who helped her strengthen her vocal cords and resume her career.

article The Respect MP for Bradford West was posing for pictures in Notting Hill when he was assaulted on Friday night.
The MP suffered "severe" bruising to his head and appears to have broken some ribs, his spokesman said.
The spokesman said the attack on Mr Galloway seemed to have been prompted by the MP's views on Israel. A man has been arrested over the attack.
The attacker allegedly called Mr Galloway "a Hitler" during the assault.
The MP's spokesman said the assailant had made reference to the Holocaust.
"George was posing for pictures with people and this guy just attacked him, leapt on him and started punching him," the spokesman said.
"It appears to be connected with his comments about Israel because the guy was shouting about the Holocaust."
Mr Galloway was interviewed under caution by police earlier this month over remarks he made about Israel.
After Friday night's attack, the MP made a statement at Notting Hill police station before being taken to hospital for treatment. He left hospital at about 06:00 BST.
He was feared to have suffered a broken jaw but the MP's spokesman said this was not the case.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed police had been called to Golborne Road at about 19:40 on Friday after a man was assaulted in the street.

article Eight boring machines have been cutting their way through earth to create 26 miles (42km) of tunnels.
Services, which are due to start in 2018, will run as far west as Reading in Berkshire and as far east as Shenfield in Essex.
During a visit to the Crossrail site at Farringdon, David Cameron said the project was "an engineering triumph".
Boring machine Victoria's breakthrough at Farringdon on Wednesday night completed tunnelling through the capital.
The prime minister, London mayor Boris Johnson and transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin walked through the tunnel at Farringdon to take a closer look at the tunnelling machine.
Mr Johnson said the completion was "an historic day" and marked "a huge success for the whole of the UK economy".
Construction of Crossrail began at Canary Wharf in London Docklands on 15 May 2009, with tunnelling work starting in May 2012.
At the peak of construction machines were aiming to complete 100 metres of tunnelling a week.
The fastest day of tunnelling was on 16 April 2014 when boring machine Ellie completed 236ft (72m) between Pudding Mill Lane and Stepney Green.
Crossrail's tunnels are made up of more than 200,000 concrete tunnel segments, with each weighing 3.4 tonnes.
Millions of tonnes of excavated material is being shipped to Wallasea Island in Essex to create a nature reserve.
Ten new Crossrail stations are being built in central London, London Docklands and Abbey Wood, south London.
Crossrail is Europe's largest construction project with thousands of workers operating on dozens of sites.
It is estimated the scheme, which will serve 40 stations, will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities.
The Crossrail project is 65% complete and engineers will now continue upgrading existing stations and building new stations in central London and London Docklands.
summary The first tunnels for the new Thameslink rail network have been completed.

article The American, 34, won three out of four Grand Slam titles last season.
"This is probably the best slam I've played in a year," said Williams, who can match Steffi Graf's Open-era feat.
Britain's Jamie Murray is in the men's doubles final, while compatriot Gordon Reid competes in two wheelchair finals.
Murray, whose brother Andy plays Novak Djokovic in Sunday's men's singles final, takes on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek alongside new Brazilian partner Bruno Soares.
Murray parted ways with Australian John Peers at the end of 2015 after the pair finished as runners-up at both Wimbledon and the US Open.
Fellow Scot Reid is attempting to lift the men's singles and doubles title, competing alongside Japanese partner Shingo Kunieda after he plays Belgium's Joachim Gerard earlier in the day.
Williams will be the centre of attention, however, as she bids to match Graf's Open-era haul of 22 Grand Slam titles, closing in on Margaret Court's all-time mark of 24.
After a tricky first-round encounter against Camila Giorgi, she has been progressed through the draw with a series of emphatic victories, dropping just 17 games and no sets in the next five matches.
She beat five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova 6-4 6-1 in the quarter-finals before seeing off fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0 6-4 to make the final.
"Even if I don't win, I really can take away that I've been really consistent and I want to continue that," Williams added.
German seventh seed Kerber is playing in her first Grand Slam final, compared to Williams' 26th.
The 28-year-old has won just once in six previous meetings - a 6-4 6-4 upset in Cincinnati in 2012 - but believes her status as the underdog and the belief built by a steady climb up the rankings gives her hope.
She will be ranked at least fourth in the world after the tournament and will move as high as number two if she wins.
"I don't have so much pressure like she has. I know I can lose the match. That's why I'm going out there to try to win it," she said.
"I think I grow in the last few years to be a top-10 player.
"Now I'm back in the top five. I think I showed everybody that I deserve it. That's a good feeling."

article The money would ensure anyone waiting 12 months to either see a consultant or start treatment by March 2017 would be seen and treated by March 2018.
Michelle O'Neill said she was confident the money would be agreed after the election on 2 March.
She told BBC News NI she believes the plan is achievable.
The minister published her strategy to tackle hospital waiting lists on Tuesday.
The minister revealed that £1m is being invested in the private sector in order to start tackling waiting lists immediately, although this is not detailed in the action plan.
While welcoming the announcement of the plan, the DUP's health spokesperson Paula Bradley said improvement on waiting lists was being hampered by the lack of a budget and election demands.
"Progress was being made on waiting lists previously," she said. "At the start of 2016, figures for both outpatient and inpatient waiting times were coming down and we need to see a continuation of that kind of progress."
Jo-Anne Dobson from the Ulster Unionist Party claimed the health minister was "engaging in a pre-election stunt."
"Michelle O'Neill is right to say that when she took up office last May lengthy waiting times were a major problem," she said. "Yet under her watch those delays have only worsened."
The SDLP's Nichola Mallon said patients who are waiting for procedures would want to know what the strategy means for them.
"We need to know when people are going to be treated and have cast iron guarantees that the money is going to be there," she said. "Unfortunately we don't have those guarantees."
Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party's spokesperson on health, said more detail and further scrutiny was required.
"It is concerning the lack of a Budget means the allocation of funding which is needed to achieve what the plan sets out to do remains unclear," she said.

article The original estimate for the scheme given at an Assembly committee hearing was £400m over 20 years.
On Friday, the DfE said £490m would be "the maximum burden" on the budget.
The way the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was set up in Northern Ireland meant the subsidies offered were greater than the cost of the fuel.
The green scheme was set up by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment under the stewardship of now First Minister Arlene Foster in 2012 to encourage businesses and other non-domestic users to move from using fossil fuels to renewable heating systems.
In what has been dubbed the "cash-for-ash" scandal, the flawed scheme meant users could legitimately earn more cash the more fuel they burned.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the DfE said: "In regard to the cost of the RHI scheme, the Comptroller & Auditor General's report estimated the 20-year costs of the scheme, if nothing is done, to be £1,150m.
"C&AG stated this involves 'a number of uncertainties' and represents 'the best estimate of the worst case'.
"Based on a forecasted 3% Barnett share of the allocation for the GB scheme, the projected available budget is £660m.  Based on those published figures, the maximum burden on the Northern Ireland budget would be £490m. "
The spokesperson said the department had been  developing proposals for changes to RHI which, if accepted, could lead to a significant reduction in future costs to the NI Executive. The detailed discussion included legal advice and engagement with the European Commission.
Earlier, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir claimed the cost could be "the best part of £600m". He told BBC Radio Ulster that hundreds of people were "using heat in an ineligible way".
"Anyone heating an empty shed has been stealing public money," he added.
An independent audit found issues at half of the 300 installations inspected - 14 of which fell into the most serious category where fraud was suspected and payments to five of these have been suspended.
But the finance minister said the number was much higher.
"The evidence is the payments," he said. "If this was used in an eligible way, we would not be using so much heat."
He said "some people are earning £40,000 a year from this scheme" and those "gaming the system" should be removed immediately.
Mr Ó Muilleoir said while the British government was committed to covering half the scheme's costs, there was an "additional challenge" if the scheme was not being used "for the purposes for which it was intended".
The threat the scheme posed to the budget was "enormous", he said, adding that his department had struggled to get all the RHI information from the Department for the Economy.
The scandal has caused political upheaval in Stormont, with calls for Mrs Foster to stand aside while an investigation is carried out.
Last week, Jonathan Bell, a former enterprise minister, broke ranks with his Democratic Unionist Party colleagues and made a number of sensational claims about how the controversial scheme was handled.
Earlier this week, Mrs Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, survived a vote of no-confidence. On Monday, opposition politicians staged a walk-out protest when Mrs Foster started to make her statement on RHI.
Assembly Speaker Robin Newton has faced criticism after allowing his party leader to continue and during his Radio Ulster interview, Mr Ó Muilleoir said the speaker "brings baggage" to his work.
"I see no future for Robin in that job in 2017," he said.

The first minister said she had set out Scotland's perspective on the EU referendum, saying she was aiming to strengthen Scotland's relations.
The Scottish government is considering its options after 62% of Scots voted to remain as the UK voted to leave the EU.
Speaking following talks with Mr Roth, Ms Sturgeon said Scotland was "an enthusiastic part of the EU".
She said: "Today's discussion has been a welcome and constructive opportunity to strengthen our relations to discuss the way forward for the European Union and how all voices can be heard in that process.
"Scotland chose to remain in the European Union, and the solidarity shown toward Scotland as an enthusiastic part of the EU - demonstrated once again in today's talks here in Berlin - has been very welcome."
Mr Roth said: "This has been a very pleasant and constructive conversation between two dedicated pro-Europeans and has demonstrated once again that a degree of Europe's strength lies in its diversity.
"I hope that the UK finds a way forward that will benefit Europe as a whole in the end."
Prime Minister Theresa May visited Berlin in July for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, which were also dominated by discussion of the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Ms May has pledged to consult the devolved administrations as part of the Brexit negotiations.

article The paper has agreed not to distribute the issues in Liverpool because of the continued anger at the way it reported the 1989 Hillsborough stadium tragedy.
It is understood six members of staff in Skelmersdale were at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster.
The Royal Mail said any concerns would be handled "with fairness and dignity".
The Sun is planning a nationwide giveaway of more than 20m copies of a special free mini-issue across England on Thursday, with the exception of Merseyside, to tie in with the start of the World Cup.
One Royal Mail worker in Skelmersdale said: "If they try to make us deliver The Sun on Thursday we will refuse and will be suspended and lose a day's pay, but we think principles are more important than money."
The postal staff's stance was backed by Skelmersdale North Councillor Neil Furey (Labour) who said: "Skelmersdale has a strong Merseyside connection and people will be disgusted to receive copy of the newspaper whose coverage after the disaster was very damaging and insulting."
Local MP Rosie Cooper (Labour, West Lancashire) added that any attempt by Royal Mail to force staff to deliver the newspaper, "would be a real strain on the integrity of the postal service".
A spokesman for The Sun said it had exempted Merseyside postcodes from its promotion, adding, "the Skelmersdale issue is a matter for the Royal Mail".
A Royal Mail spokesman said: "Any concerns about this delivery in Skelmersdale will be handled sensitively with fairness, dignity and fully respecting the views of individuals."
Carl Webb, the Communication Workers Union's regional secretary, said this was not an official dispute but the union was seeking mediation with management.
There has been a sustained campaign to boycott the newspaper on Merseyside since it published an article four days after the disaster, headlined "The Truth", which made allegations about fans' behaviour at Hillsborough.
It published a full page apology in 2004 and, in 2011, James Murdoch, the then executive chairman of its parent company News International, issued a further apology on the paper's behalf.

article Bale scored two second-half goals with Joe Allen and Sam Vokes netting before the break to send Wales top of Group D.
Chris Coleman's side reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 - their first major tournament in 58 years, since playing at the 1958 World Cup finals.
"It was an important win for us to get off to a good start," said Bale, 27.
Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: "We've enjoyed the past, it's history now. It's time to make some more.
"We know these games are very difficult - the teams can be difficult to break down - but we're learning to cope with that sort of play."
The Real Madrid forward now has 24 goals for his country - with 21 coming in his last 31 caps - and is four behind Ian Rush's record for Wales.
Coleman said: "He will break it. If you look at his record in the last two years, you'd have to say he has every chance of doing it in this campaign.
"He may know he's four goals away. He won't think, 'I've got to beat him (Rush) this campaign' - he'll just go and do what he does."
Monday's result put Wales top of Group D on goal difference ahead of Austria, who beat Georgia 2-1. Serbia and the Republic of Ireland drew 2-2 in Belgrade.
Coleman's team travel to Austrian capital Vienna for their next World Cup qualifier on Thursday, 6 October.
Wales had been expected to see off Moldova - a side ranked 154 places below them in the world rankings - but it took until Vokes' goal in the 38th minute for the hosts to really come alive.
"It was going to be tough. We had to be patient and disciplined and we were," said Coleman.
"We had a good level of professionalism and the supporters were great.
"After 30 minutes I wasn't anxious. Had we come in at half-time 0-0 I may have changed it around to ask different questions - but when we got the goal they had to come and attack us a bit more and we exploited that.
"I know we're expected to beat Moldova but we still have to do the job. The next one is even bigger than this one."
Captain Ashley Williams feels Wales' win against stubborn opposition shows how the team has grown in the past two years.
"It shows the progress we've made when you look back towards the Andorra games in the last campaign, which were similar [Wales struggled to a 2-1 win in Andorra in September 2014]," said the Everton defender, 32.
"We dealt with it a lot better tonight and we took our chances well.
"We took our foot off the gas a little bit in the second half - which is only to be expected I suppose when you're up - but I thought on the whole we did a professional job."
Stoke midfielder Allen, who scored his first goal for his country, added: "It was a convincing win and what we needed.
"We didn't want to come unstuck and wanted to use the momentum we had. The onus is on us now to keep it up."

article The boy, who cannot be named, admitted stabbing 53-year-old Christopher Barry in the chest in The Broadway, Edmonton on 14 December last year.
The Old Bailey heard Mr Barry argued with a group of youths trying to get into a party in his block of flats. He was followed inside and attacked.
The court heard the boy had been in a gang since the age of 10.
The boy and his friends had left a 13th birthday party and had returned later but went to the wrong block of flats, the court heard.
When they were trying to access the flats they came across Mr Barry, known as Jack, who refused them entry causing some "pushing and shoving" between them.
The boy followed Mr Barry into the lift and pulled a kitchen knife from his rucksack and said: "What you saying now? What you saying now?" before stabbing him twice.
The Old Bailey was told Mr Barry had not realised he had been injured and returned to his flat where he later collapsed. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
The prosecution said the boy had previously been warned about handling knives and described the murder as a "cowardly and unprovoked attack" over a "trivial dispute".
During the hearing Mr Barry's girlfriend, Sabrina Finn, who was with him at the time, said her "heart was broken" following Mr Barry's death and "life would never be the same again".
In a victim impact statement she said: "Jack saved my life last year when I had a serious medical condition which required emergency surgery. I could not do the same for him.
"Due to the nature of Jack's death I had to leave my home. It was a home that Jack and I put a lot of time and money into for the future we thought we would have together."
She said that more than 600 people attended his funeral.
In mitigation, the boy's defence team said he was "full of remorse" and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, which Judge Stephen Kramer said he had taken into consideration.
The judge refused an application by the press to lift a legal ban on naming the boy, saying there were "exceptional" circumstances.
Following sentencing Det Insp Andy Kelly from Scotland Yard said: "This is an appallingly tragic incident which demonstrates the dangers of carrying a knife. This event has robbed the family of Mr Barry of a much loved partner and brother.
"The Met Police, led by Trident, are actively discouraging people from joining gangs. This, as I said, is a perfect example of why you should not be in a gang, why you are misguided and why you should not carry a knife in public," he added.
Four boys, three aged 14 and one aged 13, were arrested in connection with the stabbing but were later released with no further action.

Coleman said his "ears will be closed" to anyone but Republic counterpart Martin O'Neill this week.
"He's a shrewd and intelligent man and he's done a great job," said Coleman.
"If Martin says something, I'll pay attention to that as he's one of the managers I respect the most."
Wales go into Friday's game at Dublin's Aviva Stadium third in the group, four points behind the table-topping Republic.

And, though tensions will be high, Coleman is not expecting any incidents on the touchline.
"Sometimes it gets the better of you, but nothing's going to happen," he said.
"I've only ever reacted if the opposition manager or coach has said something derogatory about one of my players.
"If it's going to get a little bit spiky, it's not really my style. I'll be concentrating on what we need to do against the Republic."
Coleman says his team must match their opponents' "togetherness".
"They've probably had more gifted teams, but this is a together team who work for each other," he said. "That's down to Martin."
Liverpool teenager Ben Woodburn has been included in the squad, and the 17-year-old could win his first cap from the bench.
But Wales' main dangerman remains Gareth Bale - and Coleman says the Real Madrid forward has made a full recovery from ankle surgery.
Bale completed Real's 2-1 La Liga win at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, but it was only his sixth appearance since the end of November.
"It's always a worry because when he got injured he was out for three months," Coleman said.
"I was out in Madrid last month and having a chat and watching him train put my mind to rest.
"He's an absolute specimen, a machine. He won't be undercooked. He's ready."

article American firm wHY beat off competition from 125 teams from 22 countries to design the £25m project to revitalise West Princes Street Gardens.
The design will see a series of new green spaces connected by an undulating promenade linked to the Royal Mile.
There will be a new Ross Pavilion and indoor visitor centre.
During the five-month search, seven teams were shortlisted including Adjaye Associates, Bjarke Ingels Group, Flanagan Lawrence, Page Park Architects, Reiulf Ramstad Arkitekter, wHY and William Matthews Associate Architects.
Norman Springford, competition jury chairman, said he was delighted with the whole process.  He said: "As is always the case with initiatives of this size and stature, the jury had a hard job.
"We are confident, however, that we have a winning concept that embodies an imaginative ensemble landscape approach, creating a wonderful stage for our iconic Edinburgh Castle.
"In addition, the design concept offers a creative energy and a series of unique elements which will all combine to create a new and contemporary landscape.
'We thoroughly enjoyed meeting all the shortlisted teams and understanding each approach.
"However with wHY, they demonstrated an impressive collaboration which respects and enhances the historical context and backdrop of the castle and the city, whilst creating new heritage and increasing the green space within the gardens.
"All of which were key aspects for us all and respected the importance of the space within a World Heritage Site."
Kulapat Yantrasast, founder and creative director of wHY, said: "wHY is built around an ecology of disciplines, the convergence of ideas, experience, nature and people.
"The Ross Pavilion and West Princes Street Gardens represent this convergence and this was the perfect ground to further our approach to design. To be selected from so many extraordinary thinkers is an honour.
"We felt a personal connection to the gardens and believe our design embodies how important collaboration and people are to making a place remarkable."

article The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory is expected to rise 325m from the ground.
Its instruments will gather data on greenhouse gases, aerosol particles and the weather in one of the largest continuous rain forests on the planet.
Brazilian and German scientists hope to use the data to better understand sources of greenhouse gases and answer questions on climate change.
The tower is being constructed out of steel that was brought thousands of kilometres from the south of Brazil to the site, about 160km (100 miles) from the Amazonian city of Manaus.
Because of its height, the tower will make it possible to investigate the alteration and movement of air masses through the forest over a distance of several hundred kilometres.
"The measurement point is widely without direct human influence, and therefore ideal to investigate the meaning of the forest region for the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere," said Jurgen Kesselmeier, the project coordinator for the German side, quoted on the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz website.
The Amazon jungle is one of the world's most sensitive ecosystems, with a powerful influence on the intake and release of carbon into the atmosphere.
"The tower will help us answer innumerable questions related to global climate change," said Paulo Artaxo, from the University of Sao Paulo.
The tower will be integrated into an existing structure of smaller measuring towers in the region.
When finished,  it will complement a similar observatory built in 2006 that already stands in Central Siberia.

article Bridge operators Amey said the problem was found during a routine inspection.
A contraflow is in place on the northbound carriageway to allow a single lane of traffic to flow in each direction.
Engineers were due on site at first light on Wednesday morning to do a more detailed assessment of the damage.
Motorists were warned to expect "very long delays" and avoid using the bridge if possible.
Mark Arndt, operating company representative, said: "We've taken the decision to close the southbound carriageway as a safety precaution after one of our engineers spotted a new defect to a piece of steelwork.
"Unfortunately this defect is located in a particularly hard to access area so the full detailed inspection cannot safely be carried out in darkness or during high winds. Our inspectors will however be monitoring the situation overnight and we will be ready to move in as soon as conditions allow.
"We apologise for the short notice to these essential traffic restrictions and are aware that they will result in very long delays, so our advice is to avoid Forth Road Bridge and divert via Kincardine or the A9 and M9, use public transport or travel outwith peak times."
Amey said it would provide further updates when there was new information.
The company said it sympathised with drivers who would be affected by the closure, but that "safety must come first".

article They say that, in the end, memories are all we have left. And yet how many times have you wished you could forget something?
Now new research suggests it may be possible to zap specific memories, with the help of ECT, a controversial psychiatric treatment where electric pulses are passed through the brain.
Dr Marijn Kroes, of the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour at Radboud University Nijmegen, who led the study, says the treatment appears to disrupt the natural process of storing memories in the brain.
"Memories are stored in connections between cells in your brain," he says. However, these connections take some time to become permanent.
"If you disturb [this] process, you lose the connection between cells altogether" - and thus lose the memory.
ECT was developed in the 1930s, after researchers noted that some people with depression or schizophrenia seemed to feel better after an epileptic seizure.
Electroconvulsive therapy is a way of inducing a fit, and was used widely during the 1950s and 60s. Nowadays ECT is usually only prescribed for a small number of serious mental illnesses, such as severe depression, if other treatments have failed.
No-one knows for certain how ECT works. One theory is that it stimulates the release of mood-enhancing chemicals in the brain.
Though it remains a controversial treatment, many health professionals say ECT relieves severe depression where other treatments fail. Since 15% of people with severe depression will kill themselves, they argue that ECT is potentially lifesaving.
Others believe ECT is inhumane and degrading, and that its side-effects - such as memory loss - can be severe. Many would like to see it banned.
Source: Royal College of Psychiatrists ECT fact sheet
ECT is still used in the Netherlands, Britain and many other countries as a last-resort treatment for severe depression.
According to the psychiatrists who use it, the treatment's bad reputation is partly down to films such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, in which a terrified patient is strapped down and forced to endure violent seizures.
The picture is very different in the Rijnstate medical centre where the memory-erasing experiments were conducted.
Inside a bright, modern operating theatre, Dr Jeroen van Waarde treats between 20 and 30 patients every week with ECT.
To administer the treatment, steel pads are attached just above the patients' temples. Wires connected to the transmitter device send electric pulses through the brain, inducing a seizure similar to an epileptic fit.
In earlier times, the whole body would stiffen and thrash about. These days, the combined effects of muscle relaxants and a general anaesthetic mean that most of the body remains still during the seizure. The only visible sign is the twitching of one arm that has a tourniquet attached.
One of the known side-effects of ECT is memory loss. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, that memory loss is normally temporary, but some patients report severe and long-lasting memory losses after ECT.
This study took advantage of this side-effect to see if it was possible to target specific memories.
Dr Kroes and his team conducted the memory-erasing research with patients who were already undergoing ECT as a treatment for severe depression.
Participants were initially shown two sets of picture cards, each telling an emotional story.
A couple of weeks later, just before an ECT session, they were shown just one of the sets of story cards again, in order to activate that particular memory.
When asked to recall the stories 24 hours later, they could not remember the story they were shown just before having ECT. The memory of the other story - which they had not seen for two weeks - was unaffected.
Ineke Brussard took part in the study. She was being treated for debilitating depression at the Rijnstate clinic and and is now "happy." She cannot remember what she was shown before the ECT.
"They showed me something, but I don't remember that it was that card, or such a card, or whatever, no. I don't remember."
The research aims to harness a cognitive process known as memory reconsolidation.
Each time memories are accessed, they are taken out of the storage compartment in the brain and "rewritten" over time, before being relayed to the brain's internal mechanisms.
Results from previous animal studies show that, during that reconsolidation, memories are sensitive to being altered or even erased.
This new Dutch research suggests it may be possible to get rid of specific memories by accessing them - in this case, priming them by looking at pictures - just before receiving ECT.
Dr Kroes is optimistic it could eventually be used by patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating memory-related illness.
"Traditional treatments teach you how to deal with your traumatic memories, but they don't change your traumatic memories. So what we're looking for now is a way to 'erase' these."
There is still a long way to go before patients are prescribed this kind of memory-altering treatment.
The research was based on artificially generated memories using story cards as prompts, so the next step is to find out if real, long-term traumatic memories - which are more deeply ingrained in our brains - can ever be subject to the same targeted or "spot-cleansing" process.
But for those whose memories have an incapacitating impact on their lives, this research offers hope.
Simon Buckden, a veteran of the Iraq and Bosnia conflicts, is haunted by his war experiences.
He now suffers from PTSD, which he describes as "a 24-hour cancer that you have to fight every day until it kills you".
He says he would consider the ECT-based treatment if it were developed for clinical use.
"I wouldn't be the person I am today or have achieved so much if it wasn't for those experiences, but if it could take away the emotions that are connected to those memories then I'd try it, absolutely."
summary The world is a big place, and it's a big place to be.

article A major incident was declared at the Royal Stoke University Hospital at about 18:00 BST.
Six fire engines were sent to the scene, Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
Pictures show evacuated patients, hospital staff and visitors congregating outside the hospital.
University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust said the fire was in the main building, which now needs to be ventilated.
Eyewitness Paul Bradbury had gone to visit his mother in critical care but was told he could not go inside because there had been a fire in a theatre and smoke was coming into a corridor. He saw fire engines arrive about 10 minutes later.
"People were then dragged outside in their beds and on mattresses. It was quite surreal to see really," he said.
"The staff worked incredibly well in getting everybody out.
"There were quite a few nervous patients, but lots of nurses were with them and they were happy to be out and seemed fairly relaxed. There was no panic. It was very well managed."
Patients were being allowed back inside from about 20:15.
People are being asked to stay away from A&E until Thursday and use Haywood Hospital instead.
A hospital spokesman said: "The priority is now to ventilate all the wards affected so patients can be safely returned. We would like to thank all patients, relatives and members of the public for their patience and understanding during this major incident."
West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had a number of staff at the hospital who assisted during the incident.

article The Englishman, who has two years left on his current deal, prioritised a family holiday over fresh talks after their Scottish Cup final loss to Hibs.
"We opened the discussion and then I had to have some family time," he said.
"I had 10 days overseas, three days at home, seven days at St George's Park and then back here. It's nothing more than two parties being very busy."
Warburton, who led Rangers to the Championship title, the Challenge Cup and a Scottish Cup semi-final win over Celtic in his first season at Ibrox, said he expected contract talks to resume "in the coming days".
"Apart from being very close to divorce, it was just some family time," he joked.
"The board and the owner, you see how busy they are with club business and taking the club forward."
The 53-year-old former City trader, regularly linked with English clubs, dismissed any suggestions the pressure of managing in Glasgow had made him consider his long-term future.
"It was an enjoyable season," he said. "If you can't enjoy winning a championship, winning the Challenge Cup, getting to a final, having a semi-final against Celtic, then don't be in the business.
"I heard it in the City about burnout. Nonsense. Enjoy it. I'm in a very privileged position, it's a great opportunity, a fantastic club.
"Of course there's pressure but you just have to enjoy it and recognise it's part and parcel of the job."
The former Brentford manager has already recruited former QPR team-mates Joey Barton and Clint Hill, with another - Niko Kranjcar - expected in Glasgow for a medical on Wednesday.
Liverpool youngster Jordan Rossiter and Accrington duo Matt Crooks and Josh Windass have also arrived, but Warburton hopes to make several more signings.
"We need three or four more and we are very close to two or three, which I hope will get done in the next few days, and then maybe one more later in the window," he said.
"We looked at last season and probably lacked a bit of experience, maturity and ruggedness, and I think in Joey Barton and Clint Hill we have got that.
"But I like young, hungry players with good development potential and in Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh (Windass) we have got that. The balance is good."
Warburton refused to discuss former Tottenham midfielder Kranjcar, who was most recently with New York Cosmos.
But he did reveal a goalkeeper - with back-up Cammy Bell on the verge of a move to Dundee United -  midfielder and striker were on his shopping list.
"We need cover," he added. "We went through last season with two full-backs. Lee Wallace and James Tav (Tavernier) played nearly every minute of every game.
"All credit to them and the support staff, but we were exposed. We have to have a bit more depth and quality, but make sure they are people who buy into what we are trying to do and recognise the responsibility of playing for Rangers.
"The games will be more physical, the demands and intensity will be higher. We recognise there are some very good teams in the division."

Fifa has confirmed it is investigating whether Russian players benefited from the state-sponsored doping programme outlined by the McLaren report in 2016.
Football's world governing body has refused to say whether the members of Russia's 2014 World Cup squad are among the 1,000 athletes implicated by the report - though the Mail on Sunday has said they are.
Fifa did say all players tested at the tournament, including the full Russian squad, returned negative samples.
Sorokin, who chairs the local organising committee for next year's World Cup in Russia, said that meant it was "very bizarre" for media reports to "focus on things from the past".
"Despite the allegations there are clear-cut test results," he added. "That is the most important thing.
"We don't consider this to be a serious matter and it's very strange that it's in the papers."
However, the World Anti-Doping Agency, which commissioned the McLaren report, has acknowledged physical evidence of Russia's doping required to punish those responsible - such as positive samples - may be difficult to find.
That is partly because the system Russia developed included a "disappearing positive" method that involved swapping samples known to be positive with clean ones.
The McLaren report said this system was used across at least 30 sports, including football, and that more than 1,000 athletes potentially benefited between 2011 and 2015.
It said the system was used to "corrupt the London 2012 Olympics on an unprecedented scale", while further techniques, including positive samples being secretly removed from anti-doping labs through "mouse holes" drilled by spies, were perfected at the Winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi in 2014.
The report's findings were based on forensic evidence and witness testimony, including that of a doctor who used to work within that system, Grigory Rodchenkov.
Sorokin described its conclusions as "speculation that has appeared on the basis of an incredible witness".
He added: "If there are facts, let's discuss facts. If there are no facts, let's discuss football."

article Abdelaziz Bouteflika won the presidency in the 1999 polls and secured landslide election victories in 2004 and again 2009. He went on to win a fourth term in office in April 2014, despite doing no personal campaigning and rarely appearing in public after having suffered a stroke in 2013.
Turnout in the 2014 election was said to be 51.7%, down from 75% in 2009.
A coalition of Islamist and secular opposition parties had called for a boycott, describing the election as a sham and saying Mr Bouteflika was unfit to run because of his health problems.
Three other presidential candidates pulled out of the race soon after his candidacy was announced, saying the result would be a foregone conclusion.
In the event Mr Bouteflika took 81.53% of the vote, leaving his main challenger trailing far behind with just 12.18%.
He first took office when Algeria was still caught up in a savage civil war with Islamist insurgents, and is credited with curbing the conflict and restoring economic stability.
However, when he amended the constitution in November 2008 and removed the two-term limit on the presidency, Mr Bouteflika effectively gave himself the option of remaining head of state for life - a change criticised as a setback for democratic reform.
As in many Arabic-speaking countries, the government faced calls for democratic change in 2011, but protests did not reach the scale seen elsewhere. Nonetheless Mr Bouteflika announced a programme of constitutional change to avert pressure for more radical reform.
When he first became president in 1999, he promised to restore national harmony and to end years of bloodshed. He released thousands of Muslim militants and won backing for a civil concord that offered an amnesty to armed militants.
Many of the rebels accepted and violence declined. Voters backed a second amnesty for the remaining militants, laid out in the president's "charter for peace and reconciliation", in a 2005 referendum.
Algeria under President Bouteflika has won praise from the West for backing the US-led "war on terror". At home, many credited him with a return of some security, though attacks by Islamist militants have increased again since 2006.
Mr Bouteflika has overcome years of isolation for Algeria, but his state-orientated economic policies have failed to wean the economy off reliance on oil and gas.
A veteran of the war of independence from France, Mr Bouteflika was foreign minister for 16 years until 1979. He went into self-imposed exile for several years in the 1980s to escape corruption charges that were later dropped.
Power is concentrated in the presidency, with parliament largely a rubber-stamp body. Mr Bouteflika is widely credited with easing the military back into barracks after their domination of government during the 1992-2011 state of emergency.
summary Algeria's former president has died aged 91.

article Keen's side are bottom of League One, having leaked 55 league goals.
"We need to make sure defensively we are tighter and at the same time express ourselves," he told BBC Essex.
"If it means we lose a fraction going forward that might have to be so. The only priority is to win against Southend, Gillingham, then Oldham."
The U's take on a Shrimpers side who are just one place outside the play-off places having won promotion from League Two last season.
Southend boss Phil Brown, who takes charge of his first Essex derby match, said: "We're preparing for this game the same as any other game.
"The importance of it is the fact that we're knocking at the door of the play-offs and they're bottom of the league, and they'll be smarting from that.
"It's a massive game for both clubs - it's a local derby and we just want to give it our best shot."
Keen took his first permanent role in management by replacing Tony Humes at the Weston Homes Community Stadium on Monday after leaving his post as Reading assistant manager earlier in December.
"It's a fantastic game to come in to," added the former Stoke player. "I went to Southend on Friday and was really impressed with them, in the first half especially.
"It's a great challenge for the players and myself to get our teeth into.
"And I think it's tremendous there will be a full house and I hope the Colchester fans get behind the team because we're currently sitting bottom of the league.
"It's time for the true supporter to stand up and say 'come on, we're behind you, let's get going'."

Peter Pawlett slid in the first and was denied a second when his close-range shot was parried, but Anthony O'Connor tapped in the rebound.
Jonny Hayes raced clear and slotted the ball inside the near post, then Niall McGinn fired in a fourth.
Rory McKenzie tapped in a consolation before Hayes rounded Killie goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald to make it five.
You would imagine Aberdeen were running riot from the start, but Kilmarnock more than matched them initially and had the better chances early on.
It was short lived, though, and they were ultimately swept aside by the rampant hosts and the result was in no doubt by half-time.
The opener came at a good time for the hosts, when they were not overly creative and fans were anxious for a lift after recent defeats.
Graeme Shinnie's right-foot shot from a central position was not as true as it might have been, but Pawlett had anticipated the direction of the ball and his touch took it away from goalkeeper MacDonald.
Pawlett saw MacDonald produce an outstanding close-range save, but the ball dropped to O'Connor who could not miss from a couple of yards.
It got even better as an excellent move saw Adam Rooney brilliantly release Hayes on the left, who showed great pace to surge into the box, hold off a challenge and finish.
A fourth arrived through the guile of McGinn, who cut in from the left, saw his first shot blocked but it came back to him in space and the shot was low and on target.
To rub salt in the wounds, Hayes netted his second late on - slotting home from close range after dancing into the six-yard box.
Having reached the top six with a game in hand over some of those below, this was a chance for Kilmarnock to really boost their prospects this season - but it proved a bridge way too far.
Souleymane Coulibaly, Greg Taylor and McKenzie all had early opportunities and they looked to have a good balance between being solid at the back and threatening going forward.
It fell apart and once three behind there was little hope of a comeback.
It was a touch surprising as Lee Clark's side have seemed far more organised and tight at the back.
MacDonald denied Aberdeen a fourth in the first half with a brilliant fingertip save to foil James Maddison.
Credit to the visitors for notching a consolation. Substitute Nathan Tyson cut back to McKenzie who confidently finished.
Some sides just do not seem to like playing particular teams - and for Kilmarnock, Aberdeen are definitely one of them.
Now an important trip to Motherwell awaits.
Aberdeen assistant Tony Docherty: "The boys were terrific. Very clinical in the final third.
"It doesn't surprise myself or the manager; the character and spirit of that squad - that's the kind of response you get from any kind of criticism they've had.
"I thought they went out tonight and answered a lot of critics and I'm just please we're back to winning ways.
"It was a tough one tonight. Our overall performance was outstanding."
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark: "We started very well, created numerous chances and made them look nervy.
"They get a goal and we seem to fold defensively.
"We carried too many passengers. I had some excellent individual performances which might seem strange when you've lost 5-1.
"We were easy to play against. We've just been lambs to the slaughter.
"It looked to me like we had a couple of players who got a little bit giddy because we got a positive result on Saturday. Football doesn't work like that."

article In the 2013-14 season the Premier League generated income of £3.26bn, compared to £1.51bn for La Liga.
"We hope to grow so the Premier League does not become the biggest competition in the world and we can be at the same level economically," said Tebas.
"We do not want the Premier League as a leader one step ahead of the rest."
The United States' NBA is widely considered to be the leading global basketball competition and attracts the best players from the across the world.
Tebas, a 53-year-old lawyer, told BBC Sport: "If we fail to do this [compete economically], the Premier League could become the NBA of football and that would not be good not for us, not for the sport.
"We plan to work harder in the TV rights market and in the sponsorship market to get more money."
Tebas believes Spain's economic problems in recent years have helped La Liga teams become better at spotting talent and getting value for money for players than their English counterparts.
"The economic crisis made the clubs here utilise their capital better in selecting players," he said.
"When you have less you have to work to find cheaper talent in the market. In this Spanish football has done pretty well.
"Barcelona and Real Madrid, but also other clubs like Sevilla, Valencia and Villarreal, took advantage of this market.
"The crisis taught Spanish football to work harder to find talent, whereas the Premier League had it easier and didn't have to work as hard for this."
Tebas pointed to the Premier League's financial clout as a reason why the division attracts the world's top coaches and could compete for some of La Liga's premier playing talent.
"The Premier League can pay the managers more money than they can get in La Liga," he said.
"The best players are already in the Spanish league, but the risk is there, and it is a challenge that we have."
However, Tebas said Leicester City's remarkable title challenge this season proves that the richest clubs do not always succeed.
"It is magnificent. It is literally a miracle what Leicester are doing and that they will qualify for the Champion's League," he said.
"That demonstrates that football is not all about the money, and that is a very positive thing."

article Care home owner Dr Prana Das faced charges after the £11.6m inquiry but is likely to avoid court after suffering brain damage in a violent burglary.
Blaenau Gwent MP Nick Smith has written to the director of public prosecutions to ask him to look into the seven year police operation.
He said lessons needed to be learned.
He said he had been briefed by the police about the case and he was shocked by what he heard had happened to the 103 alleged victims, 63 of whom have since died.
Dr Das, 66, faced charges relating to neglect and fraud at two care homes - Brithdir Care Home in New Tredegar, near Bargoed, and The Beeches in Blaenavon.
But a hearing at Cardiff Crown Court was told the case will probably not go to court after Dr Das was badly injured in the attack at his home last year.
The charges will lie on file, although proceedings could restart against Dr Das if his condition ever improves.
The police operation, which started in 2005, involved 75 police staff, and 4,126 statements were taken.
Mr Smith, whose constituency housed one of the care homes, said he believes the full "harrowing" details of the case should be told so that lessons can be learned.
He has written to the director of public prosecutions asking him to review the police inquiry - Operation Jasmine - and wants answers about why the investigation took so long.
He is also holding a parliamentary debate on the case next Wednesday.
"I think Operation Jasmine's collapse is no justice for the families here," he said.
"Now this case has been left on the table I want to get the full story out so people can understand exactly what happened."
Wayne David, the MP for neighbouring Caerphilly where the other care home was, has also called for a public inquiry into care homes in Wales.
He said it had previously been discussed when he was a Wales Office minister but was not pursued at that time because it could have interfered with the legal case.
But Lorraine Morgan the chair of My Homelife Cymru, which aims to improve the quality of life of those living, visiting and working in care homes, said she did not believe a public inquiry was necessary.
She said a residential care home review had been led by the Welsh government, and minister would be looking into the way inspections are carried out later this year. An advocacy report had also been published by the older people's commissioner.
"I have seen wonderful care," she said, adding that members of the public did not often hear about the good residential homes.
Operation Jasmine was a major Home Office funded inquiry into six care homes in south Wales. It was established in October 2005 after Gladys Thomas, 84, a patient at Bryngwyn Mountleigh nursing home in Newbridge, was admitted to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital after being given incorrect doses of medication. She later died.
A nurse at the home admitted neglect on the basis of not administering the correct medication.
Eight carers and nurses were charged with wilful neglect relating to injuries on her body but the prosecution dropped the case three weeks into the trial in 2008.
Following the inquiry, Puretruce Health Care, of which Dr Das was a director, was charged with two counts of failure to discharge a duty to ensure residents at Brithdir Care Home were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.
The doctor was charged with two counts of consenting or conniving to a failure to discharge a duty as a director at Puretruce, these failures being attributable to neglect.
He was also accused of theft relating to three cheques totalling £23,080.65 due to Woodstock Limited for work carried out and four counts of false accounting totalling £314,656.65.
His co-accused, Paul Black, of Upton St Leonards, Gloucester, will also not stand trial because it was deemed inappropriate to try him alone.

article Mr Obama was speaking in London to an audience of young people.
He was responding to a question from Cliona McCarney, 21, from Belfast.
She asked him about the Northern Ireland peace process.
Mr Obama said: "You know better than I do, but one of the things you see in Northern Ireland that's most important is the very simple act of recognising the humanity of those on the other side of the argument.
"Having empathy and a sense of connection to people who are not like you.
"That has taken time, but you are now seeing that among young people who are interacting more.
"It requires forging a new identity that is about being from Northern Ireland as opposed to unionist or Sinn FÃ©in, just deciding the country as a whole is more important than any particular faction or any particular flag.
"This is a challenging time to do that because there is so much uncertainty in the world right now."
The US President said "one of the most encouraging things" he had seen in Northern Ireland was "children starting to go to school together and having a sense of we are all in this together as opposed to it is us against them".
"It is going to take some time, it will depend on leaders like you to make it happen," he added.
"No pressure, you are going to be fine, you are going to do it."
Ms McCarney later tweeted to say she had been honoured to ask a question to Mr Obama.
CaolÃ¡n Faux, from Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh, was also part of the audience and said Mr Obama was "everything you could have hoped for in terms of how he spoke".
"He engages really well and there was no sort of distance between himself and the audience.
"He gave the impression that he had time to spare on the people on the room, which was massive and I think that was a huge part of his success as president throughout his term in office."

"This frees up more of people's money for them to use as they wish," she said.
The Welsh Government estimates up to 4,000 people currently pay the full cost of residential care and up to 1,000 of them could benefit from raising the limit to £50,000.

article The total is double what it was in 2013 - and means one in nine positions is now vacant, according to the analysis by the Royal College of Nursing.
The union said the situation was dangerous, blaming the stress of working in the NHS and the cap on pay rises for the problem.
But the Conservatives said plans were in place to tackle the issue.
The party has said the extra money being invested - an average of 1% a year between 2010 and 2020 - is enabling ministers to ensure patient safety is prioritised and, despite the vacancies, the number of nurses employed is still rising.
Between 2010 and 2016 the numbers employed have risen by 2% to just over 300,000 full-time nurses.
The RCN, which is holding its annual conference in Liverpool, does not dispute this, instead it has looked at how many nurses NHS trusts needed to employ, but cannot.
It relied on freedom of information requests to obtain data from all types of NHS trusts for the end of 2016 and received responses from three-quarters.
They suggested on top of the nurses employed there were another 40,000 posts unfilled across the whole health service.
This equates to a vacancy rate of over 11% and compares to a total of 20,000 when the RCN last carried out similar research in 2013.
The rate was greatest in mental health services where more than 14% of posts were empty, compared to close to 8% in specialist services, such as cancer and heart hospitals.
Official figures in Scotland and Northern Ireland show a much lower vacancy rate at around 4% in each nation. Figures were not available for Wales.
Feedback from senior nurses showed four in five felt the NHS was only able to keep services running because of the "goodwill" of staff.
The research also suggested the NHS was increasingly turning to lower skilled staff, such as health care assistants, as they struggle to recruit enough nurses.
The RCN said the cap on pay rises, which is continuing until 2019, was a major factor. Results of a poll on strike action over this is due on Sunday.
RCN general secretary Janet Davies said the shortages were "dangerous" as they were now risking patient care.
"A lethal cocktail of factors in the NHS has resulted in too few registered nurses and patient care is suffering."
She said the situation could get even worse in future years because the NHS was so reliant on nurses from Europe and numbers could be affected by Brexit.
Ms Davies said it was now time to introduce strict rules on safe staffing, while lifting the pay cap. These are both things Labour has promised if it forms the next government.
It comes after NHS Providers, which represents trusts, warned last week that retaining staff was a major concern for NHS bosses, with reports of low-paid staff leaving to work in supermarkets.
Sam (not her real name) has only been working as a nurse for 18 months, but already she is looking to leave the profession.
"The pay is an issue, but it's the pressure that is the key thing. I work in an emergency department and we are constantly understaffed. I should have not more than four or five patients, but it is always more than that. And we rely heavily on agency staff and that puts more pressure on - and I am newly qualified.
"It means I can't provide the safe care I want to. I am rushing from patient to patient. We are having to discharge them before they are ready. It is really upsetting.
"The other week an elderly patient came in from a nursing home, but the doctors could not attend to her. She had a cardiac arrest. I had to perform CPR. I just can't keep working in these conditions. I need to get out."
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said the number of unfilled posts was a "scandal".
"The Conservatives are bleeding the NHS dry," he added.
Meanwhile, Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth described it as "terrible news" for patients.
But the Conservatives have argued that the figures put forward on pay ignore the fact that half the workforce receive annual progression-in-the-job rises which bring the yearly rises to 3% on average for those with them.
A spokesman added that introducing safe staffing levels could undermine the "judgement" of senior doctors and nurses, but ministers remained determined to "ensure that standards of safety continue to rise".
He said a Labour government would put NHS services at risk because of its bad economic policies.
summary The number of nursing jobs vacant in England has risen by a third since 2013, according to

article This year, security has been increased because fears of a violent attack are high. There have been three large-scale Islamist terrorist attacks in France in the last year and a half. In July, armed men stormed a Catholic church in northern France and cut a priest's throat while he was saying Mass.
Catholics believe that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was lifted into heaven completely - body and soul. That is what the Feast of the Assumption celebrates, and it is one of the most important feasts in the Catholic calendar.
Lourdes became a site of Catholic pilgrimage after 1858, when a shepherd girl said she saw a vision of Mary there.
The Lourdes area became a place for Catholics to visit especially when they are sick, as they believe water from a local spring has healing properties.
About 25,000 people visited Lourdes on Monday to celebrate Mass. Streets were closed to traffic, to avoid a copy of the Nice attack on 14 July, when a man drove a lorry through a crowd, killing 85 people.
Some 500 security force members patrolled the area and sniffer dogs were on standby.
Organisers said there had been a late surge in bookings, possibly from people who were seeking solace in faith. One believer told the AFP news agency: "We've come to pray for peace in the world, which seems to be in chaos."
Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the Archbishop of Lyon, dedicated his homily to his country and addressed "all the faithful" including Jews and Muslims.
Church leaders have asked Catholics to light a candle in remembrance of Father Jacques Hamel, who was killed at the end of July.

Mr McDonnell was first elected to the seat in 2005.
The South Belfast MP told the BBC's Sunday Politics Show he would talk to party colleagues and "set processes in train" to find a replacement.
"I will be talking to the party about the process of moving now that I have secured the Westminster seat for the third time and that's a major achievement," he said.
"South Belfast is still a unionist majority constituency."
The SDLP also held onto its Westminster seats in Foyle and South Down.
The DUP won the largest number of seats in the general election securing eight.
Sinn Féin won four seats, the UUP two and Lady Sylvia Hermon retained her seat in North Down as an independent.
In 2014, the Northern Ireland Office passed an act banning MPs from double-jobbing.
The section of the law banning double-jobbing comes into force "the first day after this act is passed on which the Northern Ireland Assembly is dissolved".
Barring an early election, the next Stormont dissolution should be in March 2016, ahead of assembly elections in May 2016.

article Nigeria wants mobile phone companies to verify the identity of their customers.
The government says it is concerned unregistered Sim cards are being used by criminal gangs.
The South African company has been in talks with authorities since October when the original fine was imposed.
It said on Thursday it had succeeded in reducing the fine by a third.
The original fine amounted to double MTN's annual profits last year.
Since it was imposed by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), MTN has made a number of senior managerial changes, which included the resignation of the chief executive of its Nigerian unit, Sifiso Dabengwa.
"After further engagements with the Nigerian authorities, the NCC has reduced the imposed fine," MTN said in a statement. It added the fine was now $3.4bn.
MTN has 231 million subscribers in 22 countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, Nigeria is its biggest market.
In September, the company was named as most admired brand in Africa in the Brand Africa 100 awards, beating Samsung, while it was also awarded the continent's most valuable brand, worth $4.6bn (Â£3bn).
MTN was South Africa's second mobile operator when it was set up in 1994 after the end of apartheid.
It began its expansion across Africa four years later with operations in Rwanda, Uganda and Swaziland.

article Myles Bradbury, 41, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted abusing 18 children in his care at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, between 2009 and 2013.
Cambridge Crown Court heard the pen carried 170,425 images of "boys partially clothed... none indecent".
Bradbury's sentencing hearing was told the images were gathered at Addenbrooke's Hospital.
Some of his victims had haemophilia, leukaemia and other serious illnesses.
John Farmer QC, prosecuting, said Bradbury's "abuse of his position of trust was extreme".
Bradbury has admitted 25 offences, including sexual assault, voyeurism and possessing more than 16,000 indecent images.
At the beginning of the hearing, Mr Farmer said Bradbury, who was involved in church and scout groups, had a "longstanding, unlawful, sexual interest in boys" and had "betrayed his profession".
The prosecutor said the familiar routine involved isolating the victims, asking them to remove their clothes and then groping their genitals "for his own personal gratification" and not any medical requirement.
Sometimes the abuse happened behind a hospital curtain, just feet from unsuspecting parents.
A victim impact statement read to the court said: "Since this has happened [my son] has changed a lot. He feels he has no purpose in life any more, he has panic attacks.
"He's changed from a lively boy, to a withdrawn boy."
After abusing another victim, Bradbury offered the child a choice, saying, "You don't have to tell your father but you can if you want", the court heard.
The defendant was first arrested in December 2013 by Suffolk Police.
Canadian authorities had alerted the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in July 2012 that he had bought a DVD containing indecent images of children, but CEOP didn't pass on the information until November 2013.
At that point Cambridgeshire Police were already investigating after concerns were raised about his conduct at Addenbrooke's.
Dr Keith McNeil, the hospital's chief executive, said parents held the doctor "in the highest of esteem", but now they were "reluctant to go back" to the hospital.
The court heard that when confronted by a colleague Bradbury seemed anxious and suggested one of his victims had behavioural problems.
Defence barrister Angela Rafferty said she had not been instructed to put forward any mitigation, adding "the only point I make is a legal point - thankfully, none of the offences were penetrative".
Judge Gareth Hawkesworth replied: "Not penetrative physically, but highly penetrative psychologically".
Ms Rafferty continued: "Clearly, on a human level, something has gone very badly wrong in this man's life and thought processes."
She said Bradbury seemed to have had repressed homosexual feelings during puberty and this had influenced his behaviour.
The case was adjourned until Monday.

article Mr Blunkett backed an opt-in system of censorship, saying the Lib Dems had been wrong to reject it at their party conference last week.
Civilised society risked being undermined by "the most bestial activities", he warned.
He was speaking at a Demos fringe meeting at the Labour conference.
Lib Dem members voted last week to reject a plan for internet providers to block online pornography unless web users "opt in".
The vote put them at odds with their Conservative coalition partners who want UK service providers to impose "default" filters to block pornography. Labour has backed the Conservative position and urged the prime minister to go further and boost the resources of internet pornography watchdogs.
Mr Blunkett told the Demos fringe meeting: "The Lib Dems in Glasgow debated this and decided they were against automatic protection unless people chose to over-ride it, in terms of pornography on the internet and the protection of children. I think they were wrong.
Lib Dems reject porn filters plan
"I think we have a job in this country, in a civilised, free, open democracy, to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation."
Drawing a parallel with Germany before the rise of the Nazis, he suggested a loose moral climate had fed the paranoia and fear that had allowed Adolf Hitler to flourish.
"In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Berlin came as near as dammit to Sodom and Gomorrah. There was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order.
"People fed on that - they fed people's fears of it. They encouraged their paranoia. They developed hate about people who had differences, who were minorities.
"There always has had to be some balance, in terms of the freedom of what we want to do, for ourselves and the mutual respect and the duty we owe to each other in a collective society. I think getting it right is the strength of a democracy."
Helen Goodman, Labour's shadow minister for media reform, reached further back into history to illustrate her point, comparing the internet to a lawless 13th Century forest.
"It would be quite wrong if we were to preserve a special place within the law, where the net could be outside the law. The net today should not be like the forest in the 13th Century.
"Robin Hood and the outlaws - they were called that because they were outside the law - that was not a sustainable position in the 13th Century and it's not a sustainable position now."
She said the same principles of law that apply in the real world should also apply online.
And she made the case for new laws making it easier for internet users to be traced through their IP address, something the government is investigating.
Nick Pickles, director of the Big Brother Watch pressure group, opted for another historical analogy, saying politicians exaggerated the extent to which the internet was a lawless "Wild West".
The real problem, he argued, was a lack of transparency and "privatised surveillance", with internet giants being paid to store data on citizens on behalf of the state.
Britain's outdated security laws were cloaked in secrecy and not publicly accountable - and had little or no judicial oversight, he added.
And he urged Labour to challenge "an outdated culture of surveillance and a legal framework that is struggling to keep up".
Mr Blunkett, who was home secretary between 2002 and 2005, was in expansive mood at the Demos fringe, in front of an audience who felt the last Labour government had not done enough to protect civil liberties (there was a show of hands).
He said he was proud of much of what he had achieved as home secretary, such as the scrapping of the "double jeopardy" rule, allowing retrials of people cleared of serious crimes when new evidence comes to light, which had led to the trial of the Stephen Lawrence suspects.
But he admitted to early "hiccups" with the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which was initially abused by local authorities to spy on householders.
When asked why things had gone wrong, he said: "Because we are human and we are frail and when we pass something we can not guarantee that other people won't misuse it."
He also confessed to using overblown language in response to the terror threat.
"There were times when my rhetoric probably exceeded what was necessary.
"My excuse for this is that actually at a time of considerable threat, when people are fearful, the only way of securing their confidence and reducing their fear is to take sufficient, substantial but necessary action to make sure that they feel that someone is in charge and that they know what they doing and that they deal with those new international threats."
He added: "The idea that somehow the Labour government got it drastically wrong - I would say this wouldn't I? - is a nonsense."

article Tom Jensen, an immigration lawyer in Washington DC, spent a good portion of his day Wednesday on the phone to a frantic client in Iraq.
Jensen was trying to show the man - an Iraqi national who sold supplies to the US military for many years during their time in Baghdad - how to buy a plane ticket online. The man has never flown before.
The man - whom Jensen does not want to name - and his family earned admittance to the US under the Special Immigrant Visa programme, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who worked for the US military during the conflicts there, often as translators and interpreters. Jensen's client had been threatened repeatedly, first by insurgents and then by the so-called Islamic State, and Jensen briefly lost touch with the family after they fled.
In December 2016, after a three-year process, the man and his family were finally approved for resettlement in the US. They are scheduled to board a plane for the US on 7 February.
But on Wednesday, after a draft copy of President Donald Trump's executive action on refugees and immigration from predominantly Muslim countries was leaked to the press, panic erupted around the globe among refugees, their families and advocates.
Jensen's client considered spending considerable money to buy next-day tickets for himself, his wife and his three children in an effort to outrun President Trump's pen.
No such order was signed on Wednesday or Thursday, and Jensen's client ultimately decided to wait.
"[I'm] feeling frustrated and a little embarrassed, actually, that our government would jerk people around like this," says Jensen. "A guy who risked his life to help the US military during the war - I feel like we owe him."
President Trump finally signed the executive order late Friday afternoon.
It differs slightly from the draft version, though the basic tenets remain the same. The order, titled "Protecting the Nation From Terrorist Attacks by Foreign Nationals", has many immigration lawyers scrambling to figure out what will come next.
The most dramatic provisions listed in the draft version suspend all refugee admissions for four months, indefinitely bar entry for Syrian refugees, and suspend all visa entry into the US from several countries for 90 days. Those countries have predominantly Muslim populations, and are reported to be Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen.
Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, spent her Wednesday answering a flurry of emails and phone calls from all over the country.
"Everyone is panicked. No one knows what this means," says Heller. "We have clients whose lives are seriously at risk, who are days away - approved, given visas and simply awaiting travel dates.
"Many of these people are at risk because of their ties to America - either because they have family here or because they worked with American forces."
Sari Long is another immigration lawyer who has been working for months to reunite an Iraqi family - the father entered the US in 2012 under a Special Immigrant Visa for his years of work as an interpreter for both Army soldiers and Marines, and later for American civilian contractors. He has been trying to bring over his wife and sons for years.
Long says she doesn't know if the family would fall under the 90-day ban on visa entry from Iraq, or if they will be classified as "refugees" instead of "immigrants", and have to wait 120 days.
There is also confusion as to what will happen to immigrants and refugees who are already on flights to the US.
Will they be immediately returned to their countries of origin, or given a kind of amnesty?
"They have tickets to fly - we don't know what to tell them," says Long. "We have no information."
Despite the frenzied rumours of what may be to come, Kay Bellor, vice-president of programmes for Lutheran Immigrant Refugee Services, a refugee resettlement agency, says that all of their clients who were booked to enter the country this week have arrived without incident.
She is hoping that her agency will eventually return to business as usual after the Trump administration has a chance to review the vetting processes.
"I was actually working in the US refugee programme on 9/11 and that was just horrific ... and we got through it," says Bellor.
"I think we will get through this. What we've seen of an executive order does not do away with the US refugee programme or the American commitment to refugees. I'm a 'glass half full' kind of person."
However, she, like other refugee advocates, frets that closing the country to refugees and especially to former allies who assisted in US conflicts is actually a threat to national security.
"I think it's really going to hurt our standing in the world," says Heller. "Whatever our next foreign policy adventure is, we're going to need local buy-in. If we abandon our allies on this, we're going to have trouble finding new allies."

article Market leader Flipkart offered $850m (Â£648m) for rival Snapdeal earlier this month, and the sale had been expected to go through.
But Snapdeal said it had now decided to pursue "an independent path" and was ending talks.
With Amazon aggressively getting into the Indian market, it was widely thought only one of the two big local players would survive.
While discussions had been going on for months, it is thought Snapdeal's co-founders, Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, had been opposed to the idea of selling out to their arch-rival.
Softbank, one of Snapdeal's main investors, said it respected the decision, saying that "supporting entrepreneurs and their vision and aspirations" was at the heart of its investment philosophy.
Analysis: Sameer Hashmi, India business reporter, Mumbai
This was tipped to be a blockbuster deal, had it gone through.
Apart from the founders, who were against the deal right from the start, the Snapdeal board was hesitant to accept some of the terms and conditions put forward by Flipkart.
And then last week, Snapdeal sold its mobile payments business for $60m, which gave it financial ammunition to bat off the sale for now.
The company now plans to curtail operations and restructure its business to stay afloat. But it still faces a huge task going ahead.
Even though India is one of the fastest growing markets for e-commerce, online retailers have been struggling to make profits.
Due to tough competition, e-commerce firms have been offering massive discounts to attract customers - making it difficult for them to make money.
Amazon, too, has been using its deep pockets to pursue an aggressive strategy in India, which is piling more pressure on Indian firms.
And that's why many analysts believe that Flipkart and Snapdeal will have to come together at some stage to take on Amazon in this market.
India is the among the world's fastest growing e-commerce markets, driven by the rise of affordable smartphones as well as the sheer volume of people getting internet access.
According to a report by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, the number of internet users in India has climbed by 40% over the past year to about 355 million.
The same report suggested Amazon India would become the dominant firm in the market because of its investment in the country.

article At Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in south London, District Judge Howard Riddle said the extradition would not breach Mr Assange's human rights.
Mr Assange said the ruling, which he will challenge, was due to a "European Arrest Warrant system run amok".
The 39-year-old denies three allegations of sexual assault and one of rape last August in Stockholm.
He believes the claims are politically motivated because of Wikileaks' publication of sensitive material - including leaked US diplomatic cables - from governments and high-profile organisations that has made headlines worldwide.
Mr Assange has been released on bail on the same terms he was granted in December.
Bail was granted then after he had spent nine days in Wandsworth prison in London following his arrest under a European Arrest Warrant on 7 December.
Following the extradition ruling on Thursday, Mr Assange said: "What we saw today at Belmarsh was a rubber-stamping process. It comes as no surprise, but is nonetheless wrong.
By Maddy SavageBBC News, at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court
Julian Assange looked calm as District Judge Howard Riddle read his conclusions. But he remains in limbo as his lawyers begin to construct an appeal. It's likely to be tough - the judge commented that the defence team had already "left no stone unturned".
The media circus that has surrounded this case continues, but fewer supporters turned out this morning compared with previous hearings. Some of those that did made themselves noticed by wearing orange jumpsuits and bearded Guy Fawkes masks as seen in the film V for Vendetta. They insist this case is politically motivated.
Daniel Gianstefani, 16, from Australia, said: "The authorities want him to be sent away to stop him embarrassing them because they are afraid of the truth."
The judge said he was confident Julian Assange was wanted in Sweden purely over sex assault allegations. His most critical comment toward the authorities was directed at Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, whom he accused of "improper intervention".
"There was no consideration during this entire process as to the merits of the allegations made against me, no consideration or examination of even the complaints made in Sweden."
He added: "We have always known that in all likelihood we would have to appeal."
Judge Riddle dismissed the argument that Mr Assange would not receive a fair trial in Sweden that had been made by his lawyers during the two-and-a-half-day hearing earlier this month.
They had argued that criticism by Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt had made Mr Assange "public enemy number one" in Sweden.
But delivering his ruling on Thursday, the judge said: "The defence refer to the alleged denigration of the defendant by the Swedish prime minister.
"For this reason and other reasons it is said Mr Assange will not receive a fair trial. I don't accept this was the purpose of the comment or the effect."
Mr Assange's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, had also argued that rape trials in Sweden were regularly "tried in secret behind closed doors in a flagrant denial of justice".
Clare Montgomery QC, for the Swedish authorities, told the hearing that evidence from a trial would be heard in private but the arguments would be made in public.
Judge Riddle said that did not mean the trial would be unfair or breach human rights.
Dismissing further arguments made by Mr Assange's lawyers, the judge found:
During the hearing two weeks ago, Mr Robertson said his client could ultimately be extradited to the US on separate charges relating to Wikileaks - and could face the death penalty there.
In response, Ms Montgomery said Sweden provided "protection against that sort of threat and violation" taking place.
The European Court of Human Rights would intervene if Mr Assange was to face the prospect of "inhuman or degrading treatment or an unfair trial" in the US, she said.

The four-day traffic jam was caused when workers closed off two local lanes on to George Washington Bridge, ostensibly to conduct a traffic study.
Previously, an internal investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing.
The matter is still subject to a federal investigation.
Investigators for both reports did not have access to key witnesses who may have held crucial evidence.
The lawyer for the special joint legislative committee, Reid Schar, found no conclusive evidence that Christie was aware of the lane closures.
But he said two former Christie aides acted with "perceived impunity" and with little regard for public safety when they ordered the lanes closed.
It is not clear if or when lawmakers will have greater access to evidence and more findings.

They have also been dropped against ex-Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney
The IPCC has been carrying out three investigations based on allegations made by a whistleblower.
Mr Sweeney, who retired during the investigation, was also investigated over his role in the child sex offender case.
An IPCC spokesman said a retired officer had also been told he was no longer being investigated for his role in the investigation into the suspected sex offender.
But a detective inspector and a detective superintendent remained under criminal and gross misconduct notice over their roles in the investigation into an alleged sex offender.
The spokesman said a detective chief inspector had been told he was no longer under criminal investigation but remained under gross misconduct notice.
The IPCC also said an investigation was continuing into GMP's disposal of victim's body parts in the case of serial killer Harold Shipman, without the families' knowledge.
The spokesman added: "The third investigation into whether the actions of a detective chief inspector put public safety at risk is continuing.
"Following enquiries made to date the IPCC is no longer investigating the deployment of a covert listening device having been satisfied that an investigation conducted into this by GMP was appropriate."
Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, welcomed the decision on Sir Peter, adding: "This vindicates the decision I made to ask the chief constable to continue to lead Greater Manchester Police while the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation took place.
"I am grateful to Sir Peter for his professionalism, which did not falter during what must have been a difficult period."

The Plaid Cymru MP is due to lead a Westminster Hall debate on the topic.
She said: "The outcomes, the future that happens to the young people who are recruited into the army in the United Kingdom, they are not good prospects.
"It concerns me that this country still recruits people under the age of 18 when, in all honesty, we are the only country in the EU, in Europe, that does so."
Ms Saville Roberts, who represents Dwyfor Meirionydd, refers to a report released by the medical charity Medact which found child recruits were more prone to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, self-harm, suicide, and death or injury during their career when compared to adult recruits.
The report also found child recruits were more likely to end up on the frontline, and that practices for recruiting children did not meet the criteria for full and informed consent.
Rhianna Louise from Forces Watch, which campaigns for raising the recruitment age limit, was involved in writing the Medact report.
She told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales: "Some people who are young recruits do enjoy their army career and it works well for them.
"But there are other people who were recruited as children who are campaigning for the recruitment age to be raised.
"Overall, people who were recruited as children face greater risks than adults.
"People talk about the army and armed forces rescuing young people who come from a certain background but, actually, if you have an experience of childhood adversity in your background, that's actually a pre-service vulnerability which means you are more likely to suffer from long-term mental health risks such as PTSD and self-harm."
James Wharton, 30, joined the Army as a 16-year-old following a number of years in the army cadet force in Wrexham, where he undertook Duke of Edinburgh awards and learned "self-discipline".
He said: "It took me off the streets of north Wales."
After 18 months of training in north Yorkshire, he was posted to London to carry out duties for the Royal Family.
"It was a wonderful journey and experience to go from a council estate in the north of Wales to riding a horse down the Mall next to Her Majesty the Queen.
"It's all I ever wanted to do."
Mr Wharton said his army experience had set him up for later life.
In a statement, the Ministry of Defence said: "The armed forces offer young people opportunities that aren't available elsewhere, from basic literacy education and support for postgraduate degrees, to high quality accredited training and unique employment prospects.
"Like everyone who serves our country, under 18s - who can only sign up with formal written consent of a parent or guardian - are fully supported throughout their service career."
The Parliamentary Westminster Hall debate is due to take place on Tuesday afternoon.

article The environmental legal group ClientEarth says minsters failed to conduct their recent public consultation on clean air properly.
It also says the government's pollution plans for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are far too vague.
A government spokesman said ministers were committed to improving air quality.
ClientEarth's case centres on the disparity between the consultation document the government produced for the public, and a related technical document from government experts.
The technical document makes it clear that the best way of combating pollution is for councils to set up clean air zones and then to charge vehicles for entering them.
But the consultation document – produced around election time following a court ruling – said councils should try all other measures before imposing charging zones.
Critics said the consultation had been rendered toothless by ministers’ wish to avoid political controversy.
ClientEarth says the difference between the two documents could open the government to judicial review from members of the public or councils who feel they were not properly consulted.
Its spokesman Tim Reid told BBC News: "The government needs to consult on this issue – it's just not behaving properly. We are dismayed to be taking them back to court again."
The group thinks that even a brief consultation of one or two weeks on charging zones would insulate ministers from further legal challenge as they prepare their air pollution strategy by the 31 July deadline imposed by a previous court ruling.
The other issue before the courts is the relationship between the UK and the nations.
Air pollution is a devolved issue, but ClientEarth argues that the UK government must take overall responsibility for EU laws. It says the pollution strategy for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is "plans about plans".
A government spokesman said: "We have jointly consulted with the devolved authorities on proposals to further improve the nations' air quality and will publish a final air quality plan by 31 July.
"The draft plan sets out steps the UK, Scottish government, and Welsh governments and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland propose to take to improve air quality in our towns and cities."

article While there were no Olympic Games or home-grown men's singles champion to get excited about, one thing this year did have was sporting shocks, and lots of them.
There were defeats on the biggest stage that left spectators speechless.
And there were athletes who secured unexpected and uplifting triumphs that no-one saw coming.
Top of the pile was of course the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.
The Australian batsman was playing for New South Wales when he was hit on the neck by a bouncer from Sean Abbott.
He collapsed to the floor and never regained consciousness. He was 25.
Hughes' death caused an outpouring of grief around the cricketing world, and in particular in Australia.
As for results that came as a huge surprise, this year's World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany in Rio de Janeiro takes some beating.
The hosts were far from a vintage Brazil side but they had stumbled into the last four largely on the back of the inspirational Neymar.
He missed the semi-final because of injury leaving his teammates in disarray; they were five goals down within 19 minutes, eventually losing 7-1.
Brazil fans wept and the Selecao were forever tarnished.
Domestically, a sign of just how far Manchester United had fallen in the post-Fergie era came when the red devils were humbled by the MK Dons in the League Cup second round.
That club only came into existence in 2004.
The match finished 4-0 to the League One side and United fans were left fearing that life under Van Gaal could be even worse than during the Moyes era.
Fortunately for them it now seems their fears were unfounded.
Glasgow's Commonwealth Games was flush with home-grown successes, but none came as more of a pleasant surprise than the performance of Jo Pavey.
The 40-year-old was supposedly past her best, with two children at home, yet she impressed in securing a bronze in the 5000m.
It was at the European Championships a few weeks later that she really surprised the experts, with a gold medal in the 10,000m in Zurich.
She was the oldest woman to ever claim gold at the European Championships, at an age when most athletes are long since retired.

article Amber, 13, went missing from her Mansfield home on Saturday evening and her body was found on Tuesday evening.
A Facebook post, which claimed it was not worth searching for her because she had been murdered, was seen at about this time, officers confirmed.
Police have confirmed Amber's death is not being treated as suspicious.
A spokesman said: "We are aware of an offensive Facebook post which was seen yesterday evening by many people supporting our efforts to find missing Amber Peat.
"We would like to let the public know we are robustly investigating and will work hard to bring to justice anyone who publishes such appalling posts to social media."
The force declined to confirm the exact wording of the post, but it is believed to have carried graphic details of a violent attack.
Amber went missing after what her parents described as a minor row about chores.
Hundreds of people volunteered to help with the search and posters were put in shops, house windows and on lamp posts.
Her body was found in a small patch of woodland, close to roads and housing, by a dog walker.
The cause of death has been confirmed as hanging.

article The supermarket giant had expected to see a sales rise of 1% to 1.5% in this financial year.
But despite seeing record transactions in the run-up to Christmas, it now expects growth of "just under 1%".
Although Sainsbury's reported a 36th consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth, its shares fell 2%.
In the 14 weeks to 4 January, the firm's like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new stores, rose 0.2% excluding fuel.
Sainsbury's said the seven days before Christmas were the firm's "busiest ever" trading week, with more than 28 million transactions.
It described the third-quarter figures as a "good sales performance in a tough market".
Rival chains Waitrose and the Co-op also reported rises in sales over the Christmas period.
Late last year, Sainsbury's overtook Asda and moved into the number two spot for the largest supermarket in the UK, second to Tesco.
Chief executive Justin King told the BBC that trading conditions had been "tough and challenging" and there had been an expectation that the firm's sales might have fallen.
However, while October and November had been difficult, the performance over Christmas had resulted in "a small amount of growth for the quarter, taken as a whole".
"We've beaten our competition," he added.
Sainsbury's also reported healthy growth in sales of its own-brand Taste the Difference range, which saw a rise in sales of more than 10%.
By Robert PestonBusiness editor
Other successful sectors included Sainsbury's convenience stores, which grew nearly 18%, and online shopping, which notched up more than 10% growth.
BBC business editor Robert Peston described the sales growth of 0.2% as "a bump in the road after an extraordinary 35 quarters of unbroken growth", but "not one such that [Mr] King is likely to feel desperately uncomfortable".
Joseph Robinson, lead consultant at retail analysts Conlumino, said that Sainsbury's "continues to outperform its main peers".
However, he said the low growth was "reflective of a market where even the outperforming mainstream players are having to sprint just to standstill, amid growing threats at both ends of the value spectrum".
At the same time, rival Waitrose reported strong sales in the run-up to Christmas.
On a like-for-like measure, sales for the five-week period to Christmas Eve rose 3.1% compared with 2012.
Waitrose said it was a record Christmas period, with a 4.1% rise in sales for the 12 days ending 31 December.
Like other retailers, Waitrose has reported a huge increase in online sales, which were up by more than a third compared with 2012.
Waitrose managing director, Mark Price, said: "Every year retailers say that Christmas is late, but with some justification in 2013, as customers phased their shopping in line with the mid-week fall of the main festivities."
The BBC's Steph McGovern said "squeezed-middle" Sainsbury's was seeing its market under pressure both from high-end Waitrose and from discounters Aldi and Lidl.
She said Aldi and Lidl were the "clear winners" of the Christmas period: "They've done brilliantly with double-digit growth."
On Tuesday, the two German-owned firms both said they had seen their best Christmas in the UK to date, although they did not release sales figures.
The Co-op also reported rising sales in its food business over the festive season, "driven by the success of the strategy to strengthen its core convenience offer".
In the 13 weeks to 4 January, its like-for-like sales grew by 1% compared with the same period a year earlier. However, total food sales were flat over the whole quarter as the Co-op disposed of some larger stores.
So far, Debenhams has been the big disappointment in the Christmas trading updates from UK retailers. It warned of a sharp drop in profits due to heavy discounting.

article R&B Distillers is turning Borodale House, a derelict Victorian hotel, into a distillery and visitor centre.
The production of the first whisky at the site could begin in April next year.
The distillery would be one of the largest employers on an island with a population of about 120 people. Raasay lies off the Isle of Skye.
R&B stands for Raasay and Borders. Co-founder Alasdair Day's great grandfather, Allan MacDonald, was from the Hebrides while his other great grandfather, Richard Day, was a master-blender in the Borders in the early 19th Century.
The company secured planning permission for the project from Highland Council in February this year.
Borodale House has been empty since 2006 and once the work converting it is completed it will be the first legal distilling operation on an island where illicit making of whisky was once rife.
The site will have a bat boxes and a "bat hotel", providing a nesting space for the mammals in the roof of the distillery.
These are required to accommodate the UK's most north-westerly population of brown long eared bats, which were found in the vacant hotel during an environmental impact study.

But host Ryan Seacrest wasn't interested in letting them talk about her version of Marvin Gaye's classic track. He wanted to talk about #TheDress - obvs.
"Is this the dress that broke the internet?" he asked.
"I see blue and black," he said pointing at the dress while comparing it to a photo of #TheDress on his phone.
"What do you see in your monitors? In this [pointing to the phone picture] I see white and gold."
Lopez agreed with him but fellow singers Harry Connick Jr and Nicole Kidman's other half, country singer Keith Urban, saw something completely different.
"It's red and pink," said Urban.
"I see a hot guy holding a cell phone," shouted Connick Jr, as Seacrest ushered New Jersey native Jax off the stage.

article The black hole lies at the centre of the Sculptor galaxy, a so-called starburst galaxy where stars are being born at a prodigious rate.
But the X-ray light corresponding to a black hole's snack has dimmed markedly.
The find, to appear in Astrophysical Journal, has mystified astronomers because star formation and black hole activity tend to go hand-in-hand.
The Sculptor galaxy - also known as NGC 253 - hosts a central black hole with a mass some five million times that of our Sun - a quarter again as plump as the black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy.
In 2003, researchers using the Chandra space telescope caught sight of the X-rays that correspond to matter spiralling down into the black hole and heating up to millions of degrees.
Source: BBC Science
Could you survive falling into one?
But as of mid-2012, the X-ray sky has a new observer: a space telescope called the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array or Nustar, already a successful black-hole hunter.
Nustar can spot even higher-energy X-rays than Chandra, and in late 2012, both telescopes were trained on NGC 253 - with the surprise finding that the X-ray emission seems to have stopped.
"Black holes feed off surrounding accretion disks of material. When they run out of this fuel, they go dormant," said Ann Hornschemeier of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, a co-author on the new study.
"NGC 253 is somewhat unusual because the giant black hole is asleep in the midst of tremendous star-forming activity all around it."
The subtle interplay between black hole activity and the birth rate of new stars remains somewhat mysterious, but Bret Lehmer of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, lead author on the paper, said that the Sculptor galaxy could shed new light on these dark galactic corners.
"Periodic observations with both Chandra and Nustar should tell us unambiguously if the black hole wakes up again. If this happens in the next few years, we hope to be watching," he said.

article The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that everolimus, which can prolong life in some cases, was too expensive.
The charity Kidney Cancer UK, which appealed against earlier draft guidelines, said it was disappointed.
Each year, 4,000 patients are diagnosed with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
Two drugs, sunitinib and pazopanib, have been approved for use by the NHS.
Everolimus, also known as Afinitor, has been shown to increase overall survival in cases where the other two have failed.
It costs more than Â£200,000 per patient for a full course of treatment.
Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE chief executive, said: "We regret not to be able to recommend this drug, but we have to ensure that the money available to the NHS, for treating cancer and other conditions is used to best effect, particularly when the NHS, like the rest of the public sector, is under considerable financial pressure."
Dr Pat Hanlon, from Kidney Cancer UK, said his reaction was: "one of deep disappointment".
He added: "We know the NHS cannot afford all drugs, but they are effectively robbing people of a few months of life."
He recommended that doctors and patients apply for help from the government's cancer drug fund, which can be used for medication not approved by NICE.

article Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire police are handing more than 500,000 records, dating back to 1999, to a private software firm.
The East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) said the move would help trace offenders more quickly.
It added that it will save money on staffing and storage costs.
Ian Gledhill, head of Forensic services at EMSOU, said: "We now have the imaging and print quality to satisfy the requirements of the courts, making the need to hold paper records obsolete.
"This process will effectively make our bureau paperless.
"Digitisation enables us to make identifications within minutes of a print being taken from a crime scene, increasing the prospect of tracing the offender."
EMSOU said the move to digitise records is due to a shortage on space for holding paper records.
However, EMSOU claimed storage space is under pressure after the three forces amalgamated their files last year.
It added there was also a "significant annual cost to store them" and staffing costs will also be reduced.
Prior to 1999, all fingerprint records were sent to Scotland Yard for storage.
Northgate Public Services, a private company which also collects 50% of the UK's council tax, will be carrying out the work for the forces which should only take a few weeks to complete.

article The 38-year-old has taken on billions of dollars of vested interest on Wall Street, and won for the little guy.
His successes were detailed in the best-selling book Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, and apt for a tale that could read like a Hollywood movie script, Sony Pictures bought the film rights.
Brad's story started in 2002 when he began working as a stockbroker in New York for the Royal Bank of Canada, aged 24.
Buying shares for his clients, Brad kept running into the same problem.
It went something like this - his team would go to purchase a bundle of stocks at a certain price. But once they pressed "buy", only part of the order was available, and the price for the rest had gone up.
After some investigation he found that the problem was caused by something called "high frequency trading" (HFT).
But what is HFT? And why should we care?
HFT is a system that uses complex computer programs to execute millions of trades per second.
Using information generated at speeds many times faster than the blink of an eye, super-fast computers installed with HFT software can estimate the rising value of a stock before the increase takes place.
Utilising HFT since 1999 has enabled some large investment banks, hedge funds, and other institutional investors to buy stocks microseconds before everyone else. They then make a profit - billions of dollars over the years - by selling the shares on at a higher price.
Brad, who was trading for the likes of pension funds, and didn't have access to HFT, thought it was completely unfair. And he was determined to do something to prevent it.
So with a team of colleagues Brad started work on a way to disable HFT.
Leaving Royal Bank of Canada with its blessing, in 2012 Brad established a stock brokerage called IEX that would utilise a method to remove the advantage of HFT.
What they devised was a "speed bump", a system whereby trades are slowed down by 350 microseconds by using 38 miles of fibre optic cable stored in a compartment the size of a shoe box.
This doesn't sound like much of a time lapse - but it was enough of a delay to even the playing field by stalling HFT.
So anyone buying shares via IEX would not be at risk of an HFT rushing ahead of them. And IEX - like any other stock brokerage - would make its money by taking a small commission.
But while Brad and his colleagues thought they had come up with a great idea, not many people were initially interested.
Starting out in a 200 sq ft (18.5 sq m) windowless office space in downtown Manhattan, the company could barely afford to pay salaries, and struggled to attract start-up funding.
"I think the idea sounded a bit crazier [to other people] than we first thought," Brad admits.
But Brad's competitive nature - honed over years of playing hockey and the Canadian version of American football, wouldn't let him quit.
And IEX eventually began to make headway among traders looking to escape a market that seemed rigged against them.
But the biggest boost for IEX was the March 2014 release of the book Flash Boys by financial journalist Michael Lewis.
Brad says it changed his life but more importantly, it helped the public understand the issue.
Before Flash Boys was released the company struggled to attract new talent. "We had to find people who really believed in what we were doing," he says.
But after Flash Boys became a best-seller, IEX started to receive hundreds of application letters, and it was able to raise $75m (Â£53m) from investors.
Yet the company's higher profile, and then Brad's application for it to become a bona fide stock market, sparked a furious response from many in the Wall Street establishment who defended HFT and attacked IEX.
IEX's opponents said its speed bump was unfair and wrong because it distorted prices.
Jeff Sprecher, the chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, the company that owns the New York Stock Exchange, even went as far as calling IEX's approach "un-American".
Bill Hart, boss of Modern Markets Initiative, a group that advocates HFT, says: "Investors should always know the right price for their stock, by slowing that down we think investors won't see the best price."
Yet despite all the criticism of IEX, earlier this month the US regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, approved it becoming the 13th stock exchange in the US.
IEX, which is profitable but currently handles only 1.6% of US stock trades, expects business to now grow extensively.
One of the numerous benefits of becoming an official stock exchange is that traders are legally bound to send orders to it if the stock prices listed there are better than other markets.
"Brad and his team have done a great job," says share trader Joseph Saluzzi of Themis Trading, and co-author of a book on HFT.
"They have taken some hits from major players who threw everything at them to stop them, and had the money and lobbyists to do it, and after all that IEX hasn't changed its general philosophy."
Now with a team of 70 people, IEX has upgraded its office to the 44th floor of 4 World Trade Center, one of the new skyscrapers built on the site of the former World Trade Center at the southern tip of Manhattan.
Brad's David has certainly beaten Goliath so far.

article Benjamin Taylor, 24, of Seascale, was working at Cumbria's Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway when he started three blazes at the site.
The largest of the fires, in March, 2013, damaged an engineers' workshop.
The court heard he raised the alarm each time, claiming there was an innocent explanation.  He was convicted of arson.
Carlisle Crown Court heard his conduct was said to have "almost destroyed" a business which is home to the famous La'al Ratty rail line.
Taylor denied starting the fires at the railway as well as two others at the Whitehaven home of his then girlfriend.
Judge Peter Hughes QC told Taylor he was guilty of "bizarre and dangerous behaviour".

article Polls have now closed and votes are being counted, with a result expected later.
Most voters, some 6.4 million, were eligible to vote, but around 37,000 Rwandans living overseas were able to vote on Thursday.
The change would allow Mr Kagame to potentially remain in power until 2034.
Rwandans are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of changing the constitution.
As President Kagame cast his ballot at a polling station in the capital Kigali, the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga asked him why it was necessary to change the constitution:
"I did not apply for this, you go and ask Rwandans why they got involved in this," he said.
The New York based Human Rights Watch has warned of Rwandans censoring themselves out of fear of the government.
"No suspense in Rwanda referendum when so many dissidents silenced, civil society stifled" HRW executive director Kenneth Roth tweeted earlier.
People have been steadily streaming in to Rugunga polling station close to State House in Kigali. It is a streamlined and efficient process. Several classrooms in the school here are being used for the ballot, so waiting times do not seem long. The only excitement is the music playing on the speakers put up.
There has been no campaigning in this referendum - the law does not allow it. Public rallies have been carried out around the country to give people information about the ballot.  The government views this as a national non-partisan exercise. Blue, yellow and green colours of the Rwandan flag can be seen everywhere including around the polling booths.
Mr Kagame is praised at home and abroad for bringing about development and economic growth, but his critics accuse him of heavy-handed rule and human rights abuses. The president himself has said he will wait for the outcome of the referendum before making his decision on whether to run in 2017.

Paul Kagame: Visionary or tyrant?
The arrogance of power
One 22-year-old voter in neighbouring Uganda's capital Kampala told AFP: "I came to vote... because we want our president to continue leading us".
But another said voting was a waste of time "because we know the results already".
"Kagame wants to stay in power... he can have what he wants," he said.
1) Presidential term limits:
2) Senators' term limits: To be extended from one eight-year term to two five-year terms
3) Gacaca courts: References to the community courts set up to deal with those accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide are to be removed as they have finished trying nearly two million people
If more than 50% of voters agree to the amendments, Mr Kagame could leave power after 34 years as president - he was first elected to the position by MPs in 2000.
Mr Kagame's Rwanda Patriotic Front, an ethnic Tutsi rebel force, ended the 1994 genocide perpetrated by Hutu extremists and has been in power ever since.
Some 800,000 people - Tutsis and moderate Hutus - are estimated to have been killed.
Donor countries, which support the Rwandan government, have been very critical of the move to change the constitution.
The US urged Mr Kagame to step down in 2017, saying he had "an opportunity to set an example for a region in which leaders seem too tempted to view themselves as indispensable to their own countries' trajectories".
The president has hit back at "other nations" for interfering in Rwanda's internal affairs.
The issue of African presidents seeking a third term in office has caused unrest elsewhere on the continent this year, including in Burundi and Congo-Brazzaville.

article Duncan Banks, 39, was found dead at the property in Skye Road, Dunfermline, at about 17:00 on Monday.
Following a post-mortem examination officers confirmed they were treating his death as murder.
Mr Banks' family said he was a popular character with a "heart of gold who wouldn't hurt a fly" and they had been left "utterly devastated" by his death.
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of the Major Investigation Team, said: "Following the conclusion of a post-mortem I can confirm that the death of Duncan Banks is being treated as murder.
"I ask anyone who was in the area of Skye Road between 11:00 on Sunday, September 27, and 17:00 on Monday, September 28, and who noticed any unusual behaviour to come forward.
"Mr Banks was the victim of a violent assault and we are committed to tracing anyone who was involved in his death.
"Such acts of violence have no place in society and I would again urge anyone who has any relevant information to contact police immediately on 101. Alternatively, information can be passed anonymously through the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
Mr Banks' family  issued a statement through Police Scotland, which said: "Duncan was a beloved son and a much-loved brother and uncle and we have all been left utterly devastated by his death.
"He was a very popular character, who had a heart of gold and wouldn't hurt a fly.
"Whenever he could, he would try to help his friends and family with any problems they had.
"We have been overwhelmed with the support we've received from our friends and the local community during this awful time and we are all so grateful for the messages of sympathy we continue to receive."
West Fife Area Commander Ch Insp Irene Ralston said: "I want to reassure the local community that, although this is a serious and violent crime, it is not a common event in Fife and we are doing everything in our power to bring whoever is responsible to justice.
"We have high visibility patrols in the Skye Road area and have set up an incident bus.
"Anyone who has concerns is welcome to speak to an officer there."

article In the video, a car can be seen mounting the pavement and striking the victim in Mansfield town centre.
Nottinghamshire Police said it was "unbelievable" he suffered only minor injuries and is "recovering well" after the incident, which happened in April.
Officers are appealing to garages which may have repaired a Skoda Octavia with front end damage.
The victim was hit in Leeming Street by a dark-coloured vehicle, which also collided with an electric box before heading off along a bus lane and travelling down Clumber Street.
Police believe the car was parked in Leeming Street before the incident and the driver may have been involved in an altercation with people outside the Bowl in Hand pub.
Det Con Kelly Holloway said: "Had the car not struck the electric box this incident could easily have ended in tragedy."

article Abror Azimov, who is reported to be from Kyrgyzstan, said he simply "followed" instructions, and "did not realise" what he was doing.
It came shortly after his lawyer told Russian media he had "fully confessed" to being behind the blasts.
A total of nine people have been detained over the 3 April attack.
Suicide bomber Akbarzhon Jalilov detonated a bomb between two metro stations.
More than 50 people were injured by the blast.

Who were the victims?
In pictures: St Petersburg explosion
Russian security services previously said they believed Abror Azimov had trained Jalilov, a Kyrgyz-born Russian, ahead of the bombing.
However, speaking in a Moscow court in on Tuesday, Mr Azimov said he "was involved, but not directly".
He denied ever having confessed to organising the attack.
"I did not understand that I was taking part in terrorist activity," he said.
"I was given orders, and I only followed them."
He told the court he was married, with one child, Vesti TV news reported.
He will be remanded in custody until 3 June, while investigations continue.
Police had found Mr Azimov by examining Jalilov's phone contacts, Russian newspaper Kommersant said, citing sources.
Mr Azimov bought two new mobile phones and Sim cards on Monday, but gave away his location to security forces when he activated one of the cards, Kommersant added.
According to Russian media, Mr Azimov was born in Kyrgzstan in 1990, and moved to Russia in 2008. He reportedly became a Russian citizen in 2013.
The other eight people detained in connection with the attack - six in St Petersburg and two in Moscow - are also from Central Asia.

article BBC Sport looks at five things you may have missed on an afternoon that saw MK Dons, Colchester and York City all suffer relegation.
Coventry City extended perhaps the most unwanted record in the Football League on Saturday.
The Sky Blues fell to a 2-0 defeat by struggling Doncaster to ensure that their wait to finish in the top six of any division will now stretch to 47 years.
That's right, Coventry have not finished sixth or higher since registering a sixth-placed finish in the then first division in 1970.
It had all looked so different earlier in the season when Tony Mowbray's side led the way in the third tier in late November.
However, four successive defeats in late February and early March saw them drop out of the promotion places and they have not returned since, meaning a fourth season in League One beckons.
The team's slump has left Mowbray baffled. He told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire: "I feel as disappointed as I've been in the team all year. Where is the team that we saw beat Gillingham 4-0, Millwall 4-0 and Wigan 2-0? Where has that team gone?
"Maybe it's a bit too much for a few young players. I'm really disappointed for the supporters who've come out for them.
"In my mind the promotion push was over quite a while ago, while mathematically you could still do it and you keep going but I don't think it was realistic to think that we were going to do that."
On 28 April, 2015 Wigan were relegated from the Championship without playing, as Rotherham's win over Reading consigned them to a second relegation in three years.
On Tuesday, a little less than a year later, the Latics could be promoted back to the Championship also without playing if Walsall fail to beat Shrewsbury.
In reality, the League One leaders are as good as promoted already as their goal difference is vastly superior to the Saddlers.
Chairman David Sharpe promised that the 2013 FA Cup winners would "bounce back" and that nothing other than promotion will suffice. Fortunately his charges have come good on his words.
Boss Gary Caldwell was delighted with his side's performance in their 4-1 win over Southend on Saturday. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "We've focused on improving over the last few weeks and I thought today the performance was sensational.
"We deserved to win more comfortably than we did in the end."
He added: "Whether we win the league or not it is about improving as a club and moving forward. My focus is on preparing the team for Blackpool."
They all needed a miracle to survive before kick-off today, but there was to be no divine intervention as three teams had their relegations confirmed.
MK Dons went down from the Championship, Colchester were relegated from League One and York City dropped out of the Football League.
Brentford beat Karl Robinson's Dons 4-1 while Colchester and York lost 3-0 to Burton and Accrington respectively.
Robinson, who led the club to the Championship for the first time last year, told BBC Three Counties Radio he "felt sick" by their drop back into League One.
"Everyone knows my dedication to this football club and right now it is as difficult as it can be for me. I've not known the feeling of being relegated before," he said.
"It's not a case of me pointing my finger at anybody or anything. First and foremost I need to be honest with myself."
U's boss Kevin Keen, who saw his team drop to the fourth tier for the first time in 18 years, told BBC Essex: "It's an extremely painful afternoon on the side of the pitch. But the chairman has been so supportive and loves this club.
"There are so many good things about this club and it's got a really bright future. I want the supporters to stick with it."
Minstermen manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York: "You can see why they are up at the top of the league. I don't think we had enough players on their game today. We got what we deserved.
"We're not relegated because of today but because of the season. There's been too many bad performances."
Notts County might have avoided relegation from League Two this season but it has been a pretty disastrous campaign for the Meadow Lane side.
The Magpies have sacked two managers - including Jamie Fullarton after just 70 days - been dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league Salford City and current boss Mark Cooper said the team runs the risk of alienating themselves from the fans.
Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Cambridge, managed by ex-Magpies boss Shaun Derry, means they have now lost six of their last 10 matches to sit 17th in League Two.
Cooper, who said he would not allow the players to cost him his job after Tuesday's 3-1 defeat by Barnet, is only contracted to the club until the end of the season.
Assistant boss Richard Dryden told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We started horrifically. It was ridiculous. You can't work out how we are conceding so many soft goals.
"It's difficult to find a silver lining."

Tamsin Greenway and Pamela Cookey, two of the biggest names in English netball, are spearheading two of Britain's three new top-flight clubs.
But, while their job titles are the same, their circumstances, approach and recipes for success are somewhat different.
Greenway left Surrey Storm after coaching them to a second-successive Grand Final triumph and moved to Coventry to join the Wasps family - or brand, depending on which way you look at it - as one of the country's top rugby union clubs decided to expand into netball.
Cookey, the former England captain who played in Greenway's Grand Final-winning Storm side, retired as a player only for her business career to unexpectedly return her to the sport within months as director of netball at Severn Stars - a club formed as a collaboration between the University of Worcester and University of Gloucestershire.
"It's exciting and I do love a challenge," Cookey, 32, told BBC Sport.
"I want to put my mark on something. And this is something new, something I could bring my ideas to."
The task? To help build an elite squad of 12 players, establish three development sides, build community support, a fan base and club identity from scratch in six months.
Sat in her first meeting with Wasps powerbrokers, Greenway admits she completely failed to "play it cool" as figures around the table discussed their plans to throw their Premiership-rugby-sized resources - including an exhibition centre - behind one of the Superleague's new clubs.
"I couldn't contain myself and think I said, 'oh my God, this is my dream job'," said 34-year-old Greenway.
"When I was sat there and they were telling me all these ideas of what they wanted to do, that is what I was thinking - this is what I've worked towards for 10 or 12 years and I can't believe I'm sat here."
Greenway, capped 67 times by England between 2004 and 2015, left Surrey after seven years to join Wasps, who identified her as the cornerstone figure of their audacious expansion project.
"She was one of the most talented players to play for England, but she's also got the business brain and sporting brain to go with it," said Wasps group chief executive David Armstrong.
"The world is her oyster in terms of netball. As the sport grows in popularity and in participation she is bound to be at the forefront of it, so recruiting her as director of netball was probably my best decision of the year.
"As a newcomer into the sport, the most important decision was always going to be the recruitment of director of netball or head coach because that is what was going to bring the idea to life and help recruit players.
"In Tamsin, we have got that."
Likewise, the Stars made sure their first appointment would be one that resonated in the netball world.
Even before seven-time Superleague winner Cookey arrived with her 114 England caps, Severn Stars were already being moulded by a former international playing great and new head coach, Mo'onia Gerrard - a two-time World Cup winner with the Australian Diamonds.
The pair, once fierce rivals on court, are now the closest of colleagues.
"Oh, I had plenty of battles with her on court. She was a pain," said Cookey. "It was weird, the first conversation we had, because it was like we had known each other for years."
The Australian's arrival was a "major coup" for the fledgling franchise, says founding director Anita Navin.
"She was a massive brand straight away that said we mean business," said Navin.
"I'd got an idea early on in terms of what we needed to do to be seen, as I was worried that we would be a new franchise and wouldn't be seen as a critical part of it and we wouldn't recruit players. That became a big issue early on, plenty of sleepless nights about how you build a brand in two weeks.
"You can't recruit players without a coach because they want to know the style of the coach.
"A lot of our athletes in this country have their own preference of style, they don't like the real authoritarian type of coaching, they want to be empowered, have ownership, so I knew the coach was a real critical appointment for us.
"And it couldn't just be someone that has a tiny element of experience at international level, we needed to get someone that had been there and lived it."
When Cookey walked off the Copper Box court after helping Surrey Storm defend their title in May 2016, did she expect to start retirement as a senior lecturer at the University of Gloucester and director of netball at the then, yet-to-be identified new franchise? No.
"It came at the right time," said Cookey, a figure that Navin had long tried to get involved with the game in Gloucestershire.
"I wasn't thinking about any netball jobs at all when I retired. It wasn't on the radar.
"This is a nice opportunity to stay in the sport and I could create something with netball and could develop my career on the other side."
While Severn Stars might lack Wasps' established professional sporting pedigree, they have the pooled resources of two universities.
They will play at the 2,000-seater Worcester Arena, calling on the netball nous of Navin - one of the country's foremost coaching advisors - while utilising communication, marketing, strength and conditioning, performance analysis and sports therapy expertise at the schools.

As an athlete, Cookey was used to being busy as she effectively lived a double life, juggling an international playing career and club ambitions with business management jobs, which at a time also included commutes from Bristol to France.
Unlike Greenway's post at Wasps, Cookey is less focused on what happens on court as she only contributes as a specialist coach, with former Hertfordshire Mavericks head coach Sam Bird coming in as assistant coach.
Cookey's job is one that ranges from ensuring the complex partnership between the two universities works to helping sign players, establishing links with grassroots netball clubs, generating corporate support, working on events and helping to make sure that everything adheres to Superleague regulations.
She has even had an influence on the creation of Twitter accounts and merchandise.
Asked if she could have chosen a tougher job in netball after retiring from the game, she laughed: "Probably not. I tend to do that to myself, I'm never one to do things by half.
"This job brings together my talents. It's the right fit for me. I can still be in netball but not be playing or coaching."
With franchise bids won and bosses in place, both Wasps and Stars mounted bold recruitment drives.
Last season's top scorer Rachel Dunn is among several Surrey players to follow their boss to the Ricoh Arena, while fellow England international Natalie Haythornthwaite moved to Wasps from Manchester and South Africa captain Bongiwe Msomi returns to the English league to reunite with Greenway.
"It was nice to get my dream team and honestly this is the pick of who I wanted," said Greenway.
"I took a lot of stick for bringing so many players in from different clubs, but I've had relationships with these players, we have worked together a long time.
"We brought in big names, we knew we had to get people talking. I think we have become a target, of course we have.
"I had to work hard to convince some of them. There are some unknowns, we've still got George Fisher to make her mark, Fran Williams, Lucy Harris, Lucy Parize - these are important players because this is not about a one hit wonder, it's a building process."
From the sleepless nights thinking about how to approach and convince players to suit up for the Stars, the club has gone from zero to 100 players - across four teams and development squads and training partners - wearing the Severn colours in six months.
Jodie Gibson was the first player to sign and she was one of three England internationals to leave last season's losing finalists Manchester Thunder to join the new franchise.
"We needed quick wins before we could market who we were," said Navin. "We wanted the right people to share the identity, and that is the conversation we had with those three."
From there, the squad was built, taking in emerging England talent and those with Superleague experience, before looking at players in local trials.
"It feels like the jigsaw has come into place," she said.

article A judge will now consider the deportation of Ethan Couch, 18.
He and his mother were arrested in the resort town of Puerto Vallarta after a phone call for pizza tipped off police.
Couch left Texas for Mexico after he allegedly broke probation. His lawyer had argued a privileged upbringing left him with no sense of responsibility.
An arrest warrant was issued earlier this month for Couch after he failed to report to his probation officer.
His disappearance came shortly after he had apparently been filmed at a party where people were consuming alcohol, police said.
He could go to prison for up to 10 years if found to have violated his probation by drinking.
His mother Tonya Crouch faces charges of hindering an apprehension.
She and her son planned their disappearance and even held a going-away party, said police.
It is not yet clear if she has also sought to delay her extradition.
They were being held at immigration offices in Guadalajara and had been due to fly to Houston on Wednesday evening.
Couch was on juvenile probation after killing four people in a 2013 drink-driving crash in 2013.
He pleaded guilty and a judge sentenced him in juvenile court to 10 years' probation and a stint in rehab.
A psychologist at his trial successfully argued that his privileged upbringing - an unrecognised condition known as "affluenza" - meant his parents had not taught him a sense of responsibility.

article Jonathan Faull, who retired last week, said that access to the single market "is not something that's on sale".
He also warned the UK should not assume it can  broker a deal with Angela Merkel if she wins re-election as German chancellor.
Theresa May plans to trigger the Brexit negotiations by the end of March.
But Mr Faull said that Britain has one important card to play in the EU negotiations - co-operation on European defence.
The warnings by Mr Faull, who served in the European Commission for 38 years, come as the government scrambles to assemble its Brexit negotiating team in the wake of the resignation of the UK's EU ambassador, Sir Ivan Rogers.
He is to be replaced by Sir Tim Barrow, a former UK ambassador to Moscow.
In his interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Faull cast doubt about an idea, which is being promoted by senior Whitehall officials, that the UK could pay for privileged access to the EU's single market.
This would be designed to circumvent the rules of the single market whose members, including Norway which is outside the EU, have to accept the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
David Davis, the Brexit secretary, confirmed last month that the government was considering the idea.
Mr Faull said: "Can you buy access to the single market? It's not something that's on sale in that way. I find that rather extraordinary."
The former European Commission official pointed out that Norway is bound by two core rules of the EU - accepting the free movement of people and abiding by the European Court of Justice.
Theresa May has indicated that she would like to have some access to the single market. But the prime minister is to confirm in a speech later this month that the UK will have two fundamental red lines in its Brexit negotiations - control of its borders and freedom from the ECJ.
Mr Faull suggested that if the UK cannot accept the fundamental rules of the single market it would be regarded as a foreign country: "I don't think it is a question of buying your way somehow into the single market."
"You're a member of the single market as a member of the EU or the EEA. Or you're a foreign country outside it, and you conclude agreements with the EU - if you want to and it wants to - regarding the way in which your goods, services, capital and people move around.
"Or you don't and you have one or two international rules which apply and that's it, that's a choice to be made by both sides."
Newsnight was speaking to Mr Faull as part of a profile of Michel Barnier, the former French foreign minister who is the EU's chief Brexit negotiator.
Downing Street expects Barnier to adopt a hardline stance once the Brexit negotiations are formally under way when Theresa May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
But in private, ministers believe that Angela Merkel will take a more benign approach if she wins re-election as German chancellor later this year.
Mr Faull warns that Theresa May's government could be in danger of repeating the mistake of David Cameron who believed that Mrs Merkel would come to his rescue. Mr Faull was the senior European Commission official involved in the Cameron negotiations.
"I think it would be a mistake to see the EU institutions as somehow wholly different from the 27 countries. These are all actors that will be working together on this," he said.
"I think one should look perhaps at the experience of the negotiations which took place before the referendum. where perhaps some similar thoughts were expressed and turned out not to be fully realised."
Mr Faull's remarks were endorsed by Lord Patten of Barnes. The former European commissioner told Newsnight: "There's an awful lot in the British press about what we'll get from them, what we'll negotiate from them. And I think it overlooks the fact - and I'm not making a 'why we should remain' point - the fact is they'll decide."
"They'll decide and we must hope that we can get as decent a deal as possible. But it's ultimately going to be decided in Paris and Berlin and some of the other member states."
But Mr Faull said that Mr Barnier will be well disposed to the UK in one key area - co-operation on defence led by France and the UK, Europe's two largest defence powers.
He said: "Michel Barnier has done a lot of work in recent years on defence and strategy issues and he believes the UK is absolutely crucial to the defence and security of Europe, the continent."
"And Franco-British cooperation in defence and security matters is extremely important and he will want - and I think all Europeans will want - a way to be found for that to continue."
"But that's more complicated if you're outside the EU, because part of the mechanisms used for this purpose are today EU mechanisms - so all of that will have to be looked into."

Instead of fingerprints, police found the offenders had left a bare bottom mark on a glass door.
Sergeant Shane Martin, from Victoria Police, told The Age newspaper he had never seen anything like it.
"They're having a joke, or they're actually trying to lean up against the door to break in, but I don't know why they'd do it pantsless," he said.
The intruders set off a fire extinguisher before stealing a television.
Police are looking for three people spotted in a black car near the scene.
Wodonga is a town about 300km (180 miles) north-east of Melbourne.

article Councils are calling for more investment in the sector after the chancellor announced an extra £2bn for social care in England.
But Eluned Morgan said extra money was not enough to address growing demand.
Philip Hammond's Spring Budget will see an extra £200m spent in Wales over four years as a result of the extra social care cash and other increases.
Finance Minister Mark Drakeford has said the Welsh Government - which has an overall budget of £15bn - will consider how to spend the extra funds.
A recent report by the Health Foundation said that the social care costs for all adults in Wales are set to rise by £1bn to £2.3bn by 2030-31.
Ms Morgan told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme that creative solutions were needed in the sector.
"I think there's potential for us to marry here economic development with the care service in the sense that we could be starting to build homes, for example, [that are] adequate for a longer term future for housing older people," she said.
"We could build an economic strategy behind that."
She added: "I think we need a creative conversation with the public about what they want [and] how do they want to live when they are older.
"Maybe we can build eco homes where older people won't be spending a lot of money on heating."
The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents councils, has said that paying for social care is the biggest strategic issue facing local authorities over the next decade.
It has called for money coming to Wales as a result of spending announcements in England - amounting to £150m over three years for day-to-day services and £50m over four years for infrastructure - to be passed on to Welsh councils.
It claims that, if the day-to-day cash was spread evenly, Wales would have an extra £50m a year for services between now and 2020.
WLGA boss Steve Thomas said a big cash injection was needed: "We've got a £90m pressure on an annual basis on Welsh social care.
"So even if the whole £50m goes in from Welsh Government from their consequential, it still doesn't meet the entirety of that pressure."
Assembly Public Accounts Committee chairman Nick Ramsay said a new way of thinking was needed to address the growing challenge.
"One way or another we need to tackle this because in a few years' time it may be too late to solve this problem," said the Conservative AM.
"This can't be solved overnight, we need to look five, ten years down the line, we've got to make sure that we've got the right procedures in place so that people in the future can be reassured that they are going to get the social care that they need and, let's face it, they have paid for."
Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth accused ministers of being "far too slow" to act, saying inspiration needed to be taken from "Europe and beyond".
He said that there needed to be a realisation that an aging population would inevitably lead to a different way of doing things.
"We could put all our money into health and social care and it probably wouldn't be enough," he said.
A new body in charge of social care in Wales - Social Care Wales (SCW) - is being formally launched on 1 April.
Chairman Arwel Ellis Owen said social care was being made more sustainable with a greater focus on caring for people at home.
"These are not simple issues, they are very complex issues," he said.
"But I'm confident that we have here in Wales the tools now to get to grips with the challenge that we've got."
summary The chancellor has said the government should do more to help the social care sector.

article John Biggs said Lutfur Rahman, independent Mayor of Tower Hamlets in east London, and his supporters made "unfounded" allegations in opposition.
At the Election Court - part of the High Court - four voters allege that Mr Rahman committed electoral fraud.
Mr Rahman's lawyer has called the allegation "unfounded and false".
Labour London Assembly member and former Tower Hamlets leader Mr Biggs stood as a candidate against Mr Rahman, the incumbent Tower Hamlets mayor in the May 2014 election.
He came second to Mr Rahman, receiving 32.82% of first preference votes.
Giving evidence on the second day of the special hearing, he said he had been referred to as "John Bigot" by Mr Rahman's election agent and mentioned in the same breath as Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists,
But he said he had always campaigned against racism and would "defy anybody" to argue that he had not.
He said the Tower Hamlets election campaign had been "far and away" the "most unpleasant, personally abusive and vicious" he had been involved in.
Speaking about Mr Rahman, he said: "On the face of it he is a personable and courteous, if inscrutable fellow.
"I have learnt that behind the exterior is a quite ruthless and determined organiser."
Four petitioners - headed by Andy Erlam, who stood as a Tower Hamlets councillor on an anti-corruption ticket - have mounted a challenge to Mr Rahman's re-election under the provisions of the 1983 Representation Of The People Act.
Election Commissioner Richard Mawrey - a senior lawyer sitting as a judge - has been asked to declare the result of the May 2014 mayoral election void and order a re-run.
Mr Rahman, who was in court to watch Mr Biggs give evidence, says there is "little if any" evidence of wrong-doing against him.
His lawyers have described the group of four's claims as "invention", "exaggeration" and "in some cases, downright deliberately false allegations".
The hearing continues.

Ch Supt Neil Honnor said: "Due to the national security threat assessment we have reviewed our response."
Additional security also includes more road closures, he said.
The force will not be using concrete blocks, Ch Supt Honnor added.
"Lewes bonfire is a very large event and in the current climate it is not unusual to see armed officers at an event of this size," he said.
The number of visitors to Lewes can be as high as 40,000, though last year numbers fell to between 20,000 to 25,000 spectators because of wet weather.
More visitors are expected this year because 5 November falls on a Saturday.
Lewes holds one of Britain's biggest Bonfire Night events with more than 30 different processions making their way through the town.
It has seven bonfire societies, with six of them taking part in the 5 November celebrations.
This year's celebrations are expected to be affected by a strike on the Southern rail network.
Extra buses will be running and travel advice has been issued for people attending the event.

article He has been with the Championship side for seven years and took over in the role back in 2012.
Coaches Gavin Cattle and Alan Paver, who have both played for the side under Davies, will take charge next season.
"I'm absolutely devastated to be leaving, not only the Pirates but also Cornwall," said Davies in a statement on the club's website.
"I am certain Gavin and Alan will continue to do the fantastic job they are currently doing for us and I have assured them I am at the end of a telephone if they need a sounding board."
Davies has accepted a new role as director of rugby at Christ's Hospital School in Sussex, whose most high-profile graduate in recent times is England international Joe Launchbury.
"(There's been) a lot of soul-searching, a few tears between myself and my wife and then we came to the decision that ultimately I've got to move on," Davies added.
"Ever since I've been here there's been a promise of it (new stadium) being built, and it's still not happened yet - hopefully it does in the future because if it doesn't there are dark times ahead."
During his time with the Pirates, starting as forwards coach, the club won the inaugural British and Irish Cup in 2010 and reached the Championship play-off final in 2011.
"Delays to the 'Stadium for Cornwall' project have created budget pressures for the Cornish Pirates and as a consequence, playing budgets have had to be reduced for next season," said a club statement.
"Priority to signing players has been the key focus and the budget restrictions have imposed some challenging options - a consequence of these budget limitations is that Ian's time at the Pirates cannot continue beyond his current contract."
Davies took over as boss at the Mennaye from Chris Stirling, who returned to New Zealand four years ago.
The Cornish side are ninth in the second tier and reached the last four of the British and Irish Cup on Sunday with a 38-19 win over Doncaster.
"We're hugely indebted to Ian Davies for his major contribution during the Chris Stirling years and for his even greater contribution as director of rugby," added chairman Ian Connell.
"Everyone connected with the Cornish Pirates will wish Ian and his family every good wish as they relocate along the south coast to Sussex."

article Rumours and reports appeared during the one-day international against Ireland, with people writing and talking about him in the past tense while he was on public display. It was humiliating for someone who, regardless of what you think of him as a coach, is a thoroughly good man.
There is supposed to be a new regime in place at the England and Wales Cricket Board, a new start after a year that has seen the public become increasingly disillusioned with the game and the manner in which it is run.
Instead, in the past few weeks, we have had confusion about a possible recall for batsman Kevin Pietersen,West Indies being called mediocre with no apology and potentially a very serious rift developing between Yorkshire and England. Now the coach has been sacked, with the news appearing widely in the media before he was told.
The administration really needs to take a long, hard look at itself and make a determined effort to improve its public relations. A few years ago, the ECB was being held up as the sporting organisation for others to look at and learn from.
At the moment, what is going on, including the various comments from the incoming chairman Colin Graves, is embarrassing. England and the game in this country appear to be no further on from the post-Ashes mess in which Moores arrived a year ago. We are back to where we started, with ill-feeling, rancour and misjudged comments. This was supposed to be a fresh start.
I feel sorry for Moores because he has worked tirelessly to make his second attempt at the job a success. Ultimately the results have not been good enough, with the defeat in the third Test in the Caribbean one too many.
Moores is a good coach - the fact he has won the County Championship with both Sussex and Lancashire tells us that - but there is a general feeling around the game that he has not cut it at this level. He has never played international cricket; that is not a pre-requisite for the coach of a national team, but in his case it has, perhaps, proved to be a disadvantage.
His final mistake came on that tour of the Caribbean. With a little more adventure, England could have won the series.
A different attack, including either the spin of Adil Rashid or pace of Liam Plunkett, might have won the first Test in Antigua, meaning England would have had a 2-0 lead before their final slide in Barbados. Moores must take his share of the blame for the conservative selection policy.
Captain Alastair Cook would have also been involved in that, but he had a relatively good tour and his position looks safe until the Ashes, when he will need to have a good series.
The decision to remove Moores seems to have been taken by the new director of cricket Andrew Strauss. How that appeared in the public domain before Strauss had even started his job is more than just careless. And it is no way to treat an employee and a decent man.
Still, it goes some way to disproving those who think Strauss is too cautious to take the job. Removing the coach before you've got your feet under the table is certainly not an act of caution.
Strauss is instinctively measured and careful. We still know little about the responsibilities of his role, so it is hard to judge how successful he will be - is he to become a selector, for example?
However, what we do know now is that one of his first duties will be to appoint a new coach.
Jason Gillespie appears to be the favourite: a man who has done an excellent job at Yorkshire with some very good players. However taking over a struggling international team very low on confidence would be a different proposition and a huge challenge.
The options of where to look for the new coach are limited because the most talented leaders in the game - the likes of former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and ex-India and South Africa coach Gary Kirsten - are happy working in the various Twenty20 leagues and are not willing to exchange a massive pay cut for a constant slog around the world. People forget that this was a major issue when Moores was appointed for the second time - there was a dearth of high-quality candidates.
A year on, England find themselves in the same position. If they really believe Moores is not the man, it is not too late to remove him before the huge summer ahead. Better now than with an Ashes crisis looming.
But, once again, there is nothing to admire about the handling of the situation.

The stadium, already the administrative home for UK Athletics, has a capacity of more than 12,000 and the city council said 95% of proposed competitive venues were already in place.
As well as hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, it would be the athletics venue for the games.
Its proposed 25,000 seating plan would match that of Edgbaston Cricket Ground.
But Birmingham's bid has yet to confirm which of the optional sports it will include.
The council said it was following guidelines laid down by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport about how to announce key elements of the bid, including disciplines and venues.
The Commonwealth Games Federation has been searching for a new host for the 2022 games since it decided in March that Durban, in South Africa, had not met the criteria for hosting.
Australia, Canada and Malaysia have also expressed interest in being the hosts.
After Birmingham announced more details of its bid on Monday, the Liverpool Echo published an article on why the Liverpool bid was better.
Speaking in Birmingham, European silver medallist Nathan Douglas said he thought it would be "amazing" to have the games in the city.
The triple jumper, who is backing the bid, said: "I've been here since 2004 training here, so to see this actually get.... [a] bit of a revamp would be absolutely brilliant and I think for the future it'd be fantastic."
Ian Ward, deputy leader of Birmingham City Council and Birmingham Commonwealth Games Steering Group chair, said: "We can also leave a legacy behind of grass roots sporting facilities that the people in this city, particularly young people, will be able to utilise in the future."

article Opinions of the gulls range from them being brutish birds to a beautiful species needing our protection.
There have been numerous run-ins with people - and their pets - in the past, often when the gulls feel threatened, are protecting their young or scavenging for food.
The latest victim is Yorkshire terrier Roo, attacked by gulls in a garden in Newquay.
His owner, Emily Vincent, said it resembled a murder scene.
But Roo is only the latest canine to be killed by gulls while a tortoise called Stig has also been fatally attacked in Liskeard.
In May this year the Exeter Express and Echo reported the case of Bella, a Chihuahua puppy pecked to death in her owner's back garden.
Bella's owner Nikki Wayne told the paper the birds, which were regularly perched on her roof,  had made previous attempts to get to the dog, with her vet warning her to always accompany Bella outside.
And earlier this month tourist Natalie Jones captured the moment a gull tried to steal a pasty from her hand while she was holidaying in St Ives.
Noise from nesting gulls caused a problem at Furness General Hospital, with patients complaining of being kept awake.
And businessman Archie Workman planned to paint the roof of his office in Ulverston red, to deter the birds from landing there after repeated problems with droppings and gulls ripping open bin bags.
In June, BBC Radio Cymru reporter Anna-Marie Robinson was interviewing a man on a park bench about gulls in Caernarfon, Gwynedd when one stole his sandwich.
She was following up on the case of Margaret Parry from Moelfre on Anglesey who was attacked by a seagull which felt its chick had been threatened.
Ms Parry said she was left with a deep cut on her face that needed to be glued at hospital.
She also needed a tetanus injection and suffered headaches for three days.
Cathie Kelly launched a lawsuit in March 2014 after she stumbled on steps as she tried to escape a "terrifying" dive-bombing bird in Greenock.
Ms Kelly said the gull was screaming as it flew at her face.
And gulls have also been a problem in Liverpool with pianist Paul Lewis being forced to pull out of a concert after a swooping seagull caused him to injure his hand.
In Bristol a group of gulls delayed the opening of a restaurant by attacking the builders.
One victim in Folkestone likened an attack to something out of Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds while postal deliveries to a road in Cornwall were suspended after a worker was attacked.
Keith Lee called for action after being attacked three times by gulls while walking in Hull and residents of the Roundway area of Devizes in Wiltshire set up a petition due to dive-bombing problems.
Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the RSPB, said he has full sympathy for those affected by gulls but such incidents are rare.
The birds need to be carefully treated, he said, as they are on a "list of concern".
More are nesting in urban areas, but the number of herring gulls in the UK has dropped by 50% in 30 years, due in part to a decline in the fishing industry.
Mr Madge said buildings replicate natural nesting places as they provide good vantage points, take off spots and an abundance of food.
He said they are protective parents and will attack if they feel their young are threatened, and are also quick-witted and cheeky enough to take food from people's hands.
Mr Madge said: "They are not intending be a menace."
summary The gulls have been a hot topic in the UK for years.

article BBC Worldwide said "a small number" of fans had been sent pre-ordered DVDs three weeks early.
It asked those with the DVD not to reveal plot details which would ruin the "viewing pleasure" of others.
It promised footage of current Doctor Matt Smith with predecessor David Tennant "if everyone keeps the secret".
"A small number of US Doctor Who fans have received their series seven part two DVD three weeks early," BBC Worldwide said in a statement.
"We are asking fans who may have the discs not to divulge plot details so that fellow fans who have yet to see the episodes do not have their viewing pleasure ruined."
It said BBC Worldwide was "currently investigating how this has happened".
It added executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat had promised the special video featuring Smith and Tennant if the secret was kept.
Saturday's episode of the BBC One show, The Name of the Doctor - written by Moffat - comes ahead of a 50th anniversary 3D special, due to air on 23 November.
Tennant and Billie Piper, who played his on-screen companion Rose Tyler, are among those who will guest star.
Tennant starred in Doctor Who from 2005 to 2010, while Piper first appeared in 2005 opposite Christopher Eccleston, who played the ninth Doctor.
In May 2011, Moffat criticised those "who call themselves fans" who revealed crucial plot lines ahead of transmission.
"You can imagine how much I hate them," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I wish they could go and be fans of something else."
He said it was "heartbreaking" when a fan, who had been invited to a press screening but asked not to give away spoilers, had posted the entire plot of two episodes on an internet forum "because you're trying to tell stories and stories depend on surprise".
"So to have some twit who came to a press launch, write up a story in the worst, most ham-fisted English you can imagine, and put it on the internet [is heartbreaking]."
The 50th anniversary of Doctor Who was marked at Sunday night's TV Baftas with a video montage while Jenna-Louise Coleman, who plays current assistant Clara Oswald, presented an award.

A "real-time curated timeline" of tweets will bring commentary from BBC experts and BBC Reality Check to Twitter users.
One analyst suggested the move could help engage audiences who might be less likely to watch live TV.
The election debate will be broadcast live from Cambridge on BBC One from 19:30 BST until 21:00 BST.
Seven senior members of leading political parties will appear, including the Conservative Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron.
Labour is yet to confirm who it will put forward for the debate.
"It's going to be reaching different audiences that wouldn't necessarily be watching live TV," suggested Tim Westcott, a television analyst at IHS Technology.
"Live video is something that all the social media websites are interested in exploring - there's been an increase in the amount of live sport for example," he added.
The hashtag for the election debate programme is #bbcdebate and a page for the live stream has been set up on Twitter.
A similar arrangement will be made for two Question Time Leaders' Specials on 2 and 4 June, the Newsbeat Youth Debate on 6 June and the Election Night Results Special on 8 June.

Unite union boss Len McCluskey has rejected claims by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson that it is plotting to help a left-wing group take over the party.
Mr Jones said people do not want parties "spending more time arguing with each other" than working for the people they were elected to represent.
Mr Watson has accused Unite of planning to fund activist group Momentum, which he said could "destroy" Labour, a claims Mr McCluskey called "a complete fabrication".
Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn faced hecklers as he urged his MPs to unite at an angry Monday night meeting.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales on Tuesday, Mr Jones said: "I'm not going to pretend to you that things are going well in Westminster - clearly they're not.
"We in Welsh Labour fought an election last year, we're very united as a party and we're absolutely focused on delivering for the people of Wales," he told the Good Morning Wales programme.
"What people don't want to see in any political party is a political party that spends more time arguing with each other than actually delivering for the people that it's elected to represent.
"We're certainly not going to fall into the trap of arguing with ourselves," Mr Jones said of Welsh Labour.
"We're here to do a job and we intend to stick to it."

article Tess Newall, who had worn her great-great grandmother's dress at her wedding in June, posted a plea on Facebook to help find it, which was shared more than 300,000 times.
Luckily her dress was found but what is the appeal for brides of choosing a dress once worn by a relative? Three women explained why they had ditched trawling the bridal shops for the perfect dress in favour of a borrowed gown.
Kate Ridgway, from Stockport, made the decision to wear her grandmother's wedding dress in 2014.
"I remember it from when I was a child," said the 27-year-old. "I always knew nan had kept it and I tried it on for dressing up, but back then I thought it was a horrid lacy thing."
However, when she got engaged to her now-husband Stu, Joan Chatfield, known as "Nanny Chat", asked if she would like to wear it on her big day.
"I was heavily pregnant at the time, so I couldn't try it on," said Kate. "But she had always wanted me to wear it."
Then, three days after Kate's eldest son was born, her nan passed away.
When she travelled down to Sussex for the funeral, her mother handed her the box with the vintage wedding dress from 1951, and everything fell into place.
"When I tried it on, it fitted perfectly," she said. "I had it cleaned but I didn't have to do anything else to it.
"I had tried on brand new wedding dresses and I had fallen in love with one, but this felt different and so special.
"It meant so much to us as a family for me to wear it and, as you can imagine, it made for a very emotional day."
London-based digital designer Emily Clark also hopes to start a tradition of her own by using her mother's frock for her wedding this October.
The 33-year-old said her mother's dress, which was first worn in 1980, had played a big part in her childhood.
"I used to dress in my mum's wedding dress from the age of five or six to - if I'm truthful - until I was 15.
"It's one of a kind, it's a dress you wouldn't be able to find now and you wouldn't be able to replicate."
The dress was bought by her grandfather, who died last year. She said the dress would act as a way of commemorating him at her wedding to fiance Andrew Stewart.
The dress is currently being altered, and when she heard that Mrs Newall's had gone missing at the dry cleaners she says she "did panic".
She added: "I just think it's wonderful that they've had it returned."
For Rachel Cohen, from Edinburgh, the discovery of her grandmother's dress in the loft spurred on the idea to go retro.
"I knew there were dresses up there amongst a lot of random stuff," she said.
"I even found one dress which much have been from a previous generation, but it just couldn't have been worn."
However, the one Granny Marie Waterston wore in the 1930s was in superb condition and perfect for Rachel's special day.
"I had never been the type of person to dream of a big white dress, so when I found it, packed away all neat and tidy in a box, I had the idea to wear it," she said.
"I had to cut the sleeves off as she had such tiny hands, but otherwise it was the same."
Having her grandmother's dress meant a lot to Rachel when she married in 2009.
"My mother died when I was young and I looked after my grandmother when she was old, so we had a close relationship," said Rachel.
"It was special to have her dress there, even when she couldn't be."
While those three brides opted for the personal touch with their dresses, they join growing numbers of people choosing vintage items more generally.
Louise Croft, ethical fashion blogger at PaupertoPrincess.com - who will be wearing a 1940s gown for her wedding later this year - said going vintage had many benefits, from following fashion cycles to stopping garments ending up in landfills.
She said the growth of online sharing had also led to brides wanting to stand out even more, and going down the classic route often means the dress is one of a kind.
"It feels like giving a precious piece of history a moment in the limelight rather than it being in a museum or attic," added Louise.
"Of course, you always wonder what tales and secrets it holds and if it's from a family member then you are lucky enough to also have all these answers."
Kat Williams, editor of Rock 'n Roll Bride, said although dresses have been passed down for many years, a lot more people were putting their own touches to them.
"We had one woman in the magazine who wore her grandmother's dress and customised it all to make it more modern," she said. "She shortened it, added a big petticoat and made it more fitted.
"It looked great but offered that little bit of family history too.
"Even if you buy a dress from a vintage shop, it means you won't see lots of other brides wearing the same thing and a bride wants to feel unique."

article Craig Mathieson, the first ever Explorer in Residence of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, is to undertake the five-day expedition with his son.
The 45-year-old is using the expedition as training before leading ten North Lanarkshire pupils to Arctic Greenland next year.
Each "Polar Academy" pupil will have to haul their own 40kg sledge.
Mr Mathieson, of Bo'ness, has led various expeditions to the South and North poles in the past, and in 2006 he trained Christ Struthers, a "troubled" 15-year-old from Falkirk, to successfully haul his own sledge to the North Pole.
Ahead of next year's expedition, he is limbering up by rowing 70 miles down Scottish waterways in a 16.5ft PVC collapsible "Ally" canoe with his son Jake.
The pair will camp en route as they negotiate the likes of the Caledonian Canal and the length of Loch Ness, rowing for up to eight hours a day, starting from Fort William and finishing in Inverness.
Former military man Mr Mathieson set up the Polar Academy, a registered charity, last year.
He believes that exposing youths to the mental and physical demands of preparing for and undertaking Arctic exploration can have life-changing benefits.
Five pupils have already been selected for the ten-day expedition next year, with five more to be picked in July.
Mr Mathieson said: "The Polar Academy is all about giving Scotland's 'invisible' school pupils, those who otherwise just drift aimlessly through their school days, a way to discover the confidence and self-belief to fulfil their true potential both within and beyond the school gates.
"It's an exciting period for all involved with the Polar Academy, a unique expedition that will see pupils across Scotland able to track our progress in Greenland and to hear first-hand from the young participants once they return to Scotland.
"The water-borne expedition in the Ally canoe across Scotland with Jake is an opportunity for us to share the excitement and challenge of a family expedition and to give my own son further exposure to the mental and physical demands of undertaking an unsupported expedition."

article The move has been described as "historic", and the regulator will make its decision next month.
Doctors want to make babies from three people to prevent diseases that starve the body of energy, leading to brain damage, muscle wasting and heart failure.
However, fresh evidence suggests it will fail in one in eight pregnancies.
Three-person IVF replaces the defective power packs in the mother's egg - called mitochondria - with healthy ones from a donor woman.
A three-person baby has most of its genetic inheritance from its parents, but also a tiny amount from the donor woman.
Parliament has already legalised the controversial procedure, and a baby has been born from the technique in Mexico.
However, there have been calls for extra checks on the science before it goes ahead in the UK.
Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, one of the researchers who reviewed the evidence, said the moment had come.
"We're not going to learn much more now unless you try it out for real basically - it's at that stage," he said.
"There's no reason why it shouldn't go ahead now, but do it cautiously on selected patients where the risk of having a badly affected child is very high."
Nucleus: where the majority of our DNA is held - this determines how we look and our personality
Mitochondria: often described as the cell's factories, these create the energy to make the cell function
Cytoplasm: the jelly-like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria
However, the technique can still lead to some defective mitochondria ending up in the resulting embryo.
A study, published in Nature, suggests those defective mitochondria could still take over in one in eight babies and cause disease.
Researchers at Oregon Health and Science Unit created embryos from four women who had children with mitochondrial disease.
Samples of those embryonic cells were then grown in the laboratory.
Prof Paula Amato, who published her findings in the journal Nature, said: "Some embryonic stem cell lines did revert back to the mutant mitochondrial DNA."
The scientific review team has recommended extra checks during pregnancy to ensure the baby is healthy.
Prof Lovell-Badge said: "It's likely to be something we have to worry about if the experiments that have been done on embryonic stem cells are representative of embryos that were re-implanted.
"That's why we recommend a pre-natal diagnosis method to check whether reversion is occurring in the developing foetus."
A team in Newcastle has pioneered research in the field and is likely to be the first to be given a licence to make three-person babies.
Prof Doug Turnbull, from Newcastle University, said: "This is obviously great news, and I agree with the report conclusions.
"I think the report highlights the very careful way in which the UK has proceeded with this new IVF technique and hope the HFEA [Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority] approve this at their meeting in December."
Commenting on the report, Prof Bert Smeets, from Maastricht University, said: "It is historic that the independent science review panel concludes that it is appropriate to offer mitochondrial donation techniques as clinical risk reduction treatment for carefully selected patients."

article He told his party devolution had brought "peace and prosperity" and added that he looked back "with pride at all that we together have achieved".
He said after three years of problems at Stormont, the latest 'Fresh Start' deal means "politics can work again".
He is to quit as Northern Ireland first minister and DUP leader within weeks.
Mr Robinson announced his retirement on Thursday, two days after the agreement was struck between the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in and the British and Irish governments.
The Fresh Start document addressed some but not all of the issues that had caused months of political deadlock and placed the future of devolution in doubt.
Mr Robinson told the DUP's annual party conference on Saturday "my work is almost done, and now it is time for the next generation to step forward".
"I wanted to make sure that I was handing over the reins of a political process that was stable and secure for the long term.
"After a seemingly endless process I am delighted that we have finally reached agreement on the way forward.  We have resolved all those toxic issues that threatened the continuation of devolution."
"So as I prepare to bow out I do so in the knowledge that the province is on safe ground and this party is in good shape to take Northern Ireland forward."

Mr Robinson was cheered and given a standing ovation as he took to the podium at the La Mon House hotel, with many of this party colleagues hugging him and shaking his hand.
He told them Northern Ireland's place within the UK is "secure" and congratulated them on maintaining their position as "Northern Ireland's largest party".
"Ulster is no longer at the crossroads - we're on the motorway and on a clear path to a better future," he said.
The DUP leader said the Fresh Start deal had removed "the threat of bankruptcy and collapse" from Stormont.
"The fundamental block on politics these last three years has been the refusal of some to face up to financial realities and accept welfare reform.
"That impasse soured relations; starved key public services of much needed resources, and threatened the executive with financial ruin.
"This deal ends that uncertainty and removes the obstacles to progress."
Outside the conference there was a small protest from same-sex marriage campaigners who criticised the DUP for blocking a recent assembly vote on the issue.
But inside there was nothing but hugs and cheers for the outgoing leader, with some members weeping openly as his last speech drew to its conclusion.
Mr Robinson is one of the founding members of the DUP and his political career has lasted more than 40 years.
He took over as first minister and DUP leader from the late Ian Paisley in 2008.
His formal retirement will not take effect until some time around the end of the year, but he said he intends to remain as a member of the DUP after he steps down.

article The Boulogne prosecutor said Gen Christian Piquemal, who is in his 70s,  was suffering from poor health. He was released on bail, according to reports.
Gen Piquemal is accused of helping to organise the rally on Saturday.
Police had told supporters of the anti-Islamic group Pegida to disperse, and then fired tear gas to break them up.
They were taking part in a Europe-wide demonstration against what they say is the Islamisation of the continent.
The northern port city of Calais is home to thousands of asylum seekers who are living in a camp known as the "Jungle" while they try to slip illegally into the UK.
Gen Piquemal was one of several people arrested on Saturday. News of his release on Monday was greeted with cheers by a group of his supporters gathered outside the court in Boulogne. They than sang the French national anthem.
Some reports on French media said Gen Piquemal had been admitted to hospital on Monday morning, but this was not confirmed.
Gen Piquemal, who commanded the elite French Foreign Legion for five years, is accused of playing a "principal role" in organising the illegal demonstration. He could face up to a year in prison and a heavy fine if found guilty.
Gen Piquemal was one of about 150 Pegida supporters who had gathered in Calais chanting slogans such as "We must not let Calais die" and "Calais is part of France".
At the time of his arrest, Gen Piquemal said he was "shocked" that officers had broken up the protest during the singing of the national anthem.
"I expected you to be at attention, singing with us but not one of you opened your mouth," he told them.
French authorities had banned all rallies in Calais "regardless of the organisers".

article In a BBC interview, Tim Roache urged Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to do more to make the case for EU membership.
It comes ahead of a speech by Mr Corbyn in which he will say workers' rights are best protected by being in the EU.
But Vote Leave chairwoman and Labour MP Gisela Stuart has said workers' rights were "hard won" in the UK, not Europe.
In other developments:
There are just weeks to go until the UK decides on its future in the European Union, in the in-out referendum on 23 June.
The Remain campaign believes that securing the support of Labour voters will be vital to winning the referendum.
How working conditions and pay rates are affected by EU membership.
But there are anxieties within the Remain camp that Labour voters might not turn out to vote, when the levels of turnout could be decisive.
In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Roache said his "biggest concern" was that Labour voters would "stay at home" on 23 June.
"I think they won't see it as the absolutely crucial vote that it is and I also think that they see it as a bunfight in the Tory party," he said.
Asked whether he thought Labour was doing enough to get its pro-Remain message across, he said it "is starting to do more".
But he argued that a bigger push was needed, warning: "The reality is that the more people that stay at home the more likely it is that we will leave the EU. I don't think we can even begin to contemplate that."
By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor
It's rare these days - especially as the referendum debate rages with both sides to varying degrees struggling to tell the public the truth, the whole truth, and absolutely nothing but the truth - that political figures are willing to say exactly what they think in public.
But the union movement, in the recently elected boss of the GMB, Tim Roache, might just have found themselves someone who might.
He's worked for the union for decades, starting as a teenager in the post room. But after years of working his way up, now he's in charge, Roache is clearly determined to change things.
And in an interview with me for Radio 4's World at One programme, he didn't hold back.

On Jeremy Corbyn - who has been urged to make a bolder case for staying in the UK - Mr Roache said he viewed the Labour leader as "a half-hearted Remain" but urged the party to get behind him and campaign vigorously to stay in the EU.
"I think he probably could do a bit more, let's hope he will," he said.
The union leader's call for action comes as the Labour leader prepares to make a speech warning about the impact on workers' rights if the UK left the EU.
Speaking at the Institute of Engineering Technology on Thursday, Mr Corbyn - who has been a long-standing critic of the EU and who is regarded as the most Eurosceptic Labour leader in years - will say British workers benefit from a host of rights and protections because of EU legislation.
He will say the European social chapter and other EU directives have secured:
"It's important to understand the benefit of these gains," he will say. "It means workers throughout Europe have decent rights at work, meaning it's harder to undercut terms and conditions across Europe."
The Labour leader will accuse Tory Leave supporters of wanting to "rip up" workers' protections and say it is the Conservative government that is the real "threat" to Britain - not the EU.
"Everything they have done as a government so far means we could not rely on them to protect the workplace rights that millions rely on.
"A Tory Brexit negotiation would be a disaster for the majority of people in Britain," he will add.
But Leave campaigners, including Vote Leave's Ms Stuart, say the EU has been "a disaster" for workers, pointing out that unemployment levels across the eurozone are "in the double digits".
The Labour MP has also dismissed Remain's argument that workers' rights have been secured by Europe.
"Workers' rights are not something that have been gifted to us by the EU, they have been hard won here at home and should be protected by a Parliament that is properly accountable to voters in the UK."
She has said the only way to "take back control of our economy, our democracy" is to leave the EU.

article Kieron Fallon, 27 of Radway Road, Huyton in Liverpool pleaded guilty to two counts of possession with intent to supply at Exeter Crown Court on Friday.
The drugs runner was caught by police on the M5 at Collompton with Â£5,500 worth of Heroin and cocaine.
Judge Geoffrey Mercer said: "People who involve themselves in the supply of drugs do so with their eyes open."
The court heard Fallon agreed to deliver drugs to Devon and Cornwall from his home in Liverpool because he had lost his job and got into debt.
He was carrying 72 wraps of crack cocaine and 152 of heroin when he was stopped by police.
He has been living with his partner and three-year-old daughter and took a job as a warehouseman since his arrest in July.
Judge Mercer said: "You have a partner and a young family. You should have thought about them before you embarked on this enterprise."
Mr Barry Smith, defending, said Fallon played a lesser role and was directed by those higher up the chain.

article Speaking at the White House, he said the US would keep 5,500 troops in the country when he leaves office in 2017.
Originally all but a small embassy-based force were due to leave by the end of next year.
But the US military says more troops will be needed to help Afghan forces counter a growing Taliban threat.
There are currently 9,800 US troops stationed in Afghanistan.
The US forces will be stationed in four locations - Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad and Kandahar.
Announcing the plan on Thursday, President Obama said the troop extension could "make a real difference" for Afghanistan and Afghan security forces, which he acknowledged were "not as strong" as they needed to be.
He said the ending of Nato combat operations in December last year had come at a price, with many Afghan troops and civilians killed since the Taliban stepped up its insurgency.
"It's the right thing to do," the president said about the policy change. "As commander in chief I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again."
For the Taliban, he continued, it should be clear that the only way to achieve a full pullout of US troops is through a lasting settlement with the Afghan government.
He described the mission in Afghanistan as "vital to US national security interests".
The slowing of the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan means that President Obama will not be able to bring home all US forces before his presidency ends.
A US review of its troop presence there has been under way for some months and is not directly linked to the Taliban's recent success in briefly seizing the town of Kunduz.
But that episode illustrated the continuing need for the US training and mentoring of Afghan forces.
With al-Qaeda again operating in Afghanistan and the so-called Islamic State gaining a foothold, Washington is also eager to retain a small number of bases from which it can mount counter-terrorist operations.
Whatever the hopes of a full US withdrawal, it now looks as though Washington is set to have a continuing military commitment to Afghanistan, where US air power in particular plays an essential role.
President Obama had previously planned to reduce the number of troops left in Afghanistan to about 1,000 by the time he left office in January 2017.
An earlier statement from the US National Security Council said the change in policy was the "result of an extensive, months-long review", and after Mr Obama had consulted "with his full national security team and our Afghan partners".
"This announcement in no way changes the fact that our combat mission in Afghanistan has ended, and we will continue to undertake only two narrow missions: counterterrorism and training, advising, and assisting our Afghan partners," the statement went on.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is expected to welcome the move, as he had been pushing for a slower withdrawal of US troops to allow Afghan forces to be better trained and equipped.
The top US military commander in Afghanistan, Gen John Campbell, expressed concern last week over the "tenuous security situation" and said an enhanced military presence would be necessary if the Taliban were to be repelled.
He was speaking days after the Taliban briefly seized the northern city of Kunduz - their most spectacular military gain since being ousted from power in 2001.
Read more on Afghanistan:
After the Taliban's surprise attack on Kunduz, Afghan government forces managed to retake control of key areas of the city with the aid of Nato special forces and US air strikes.
But the city's brief capture was seen as a setback for the Afghan authorities under pressure to show they can keep the country secure without the backing of international forces.
The south-eastern city of Ghazni has also seen fierce clashes between Taliban insurgents and US-trained Afghan troops in recent days.
Militant violence has increased across Afghanistan since Nato ended its combat mission there in December 2014, leaving a residual force - mainly US troops - used for training and counter-terrorism operations.
The shift in policy comes at the same time as three separate investigations - by the US, Nato and Afghan authorities - into a US air attack on an MSF-run hospital in Kunduz that killed 22 people.
The US said the bombing was a mistake, and President Obama later apologised.

article Brian Irvine is among eight winners who have each picked up Â£50,000 from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.
A musician, composer and conductor, Mr Irvine was named as music laureate for Belfast in December 2014.
He is one of three composers from the UK to receive an award in 2015, while the other five recipients are visual artists.
Earlier this year, his opera 'LovegolfLove', written with playwright Owen McCafferty, was performed in Newcastle during the Irish Open.
A former associate composer with the Ulster Orchestra, his work has been performed at festivals across the globe.
He has worked with a number of local organisations, as well as with prisoners, schoolchildren and marching bands, and was responsible for the Northern Ireland concert as part of the cultural Olympiad which accompanied the 2012 Olympic Games.
His forthcoming compositions include No Comply, a musical installation involving skateboarders which is due to be unveiled in March 2016.
Mr Irvine said the award would allow him to work harder and develop more projects.
"It equips me with an opportunity and a financial infrastructure that quadruples my ambition and desire to make the most exciting, engaging, confusing, connecting, ridiculous and beautiful work I can imagine," he added.
The Hamlyn Foundation Award provides financial assistance for artists and composers to develop their careers.
The award winners were announced in London on Thursday, at an event which included a speech by novelist Jeanette Winterson.

article The government is under immense pressure. Its underpaid and overstretched forces have been on the back foot in their first season without Nato combat support.
They are trying to push the Taliban back, most recently in the key southern province of Helmand - but the way the insurgents took the northern city of Kunduz still weighs on people's minds.
Afghans are watching all this with great concern. It is no surprise that - after Syria - the highest number of migrants in Europe come from Afghanistan.
People here wonder which is the greater gamble - continuing to live in Afghanistan or risking death on the journey out.
In the current climate one group is doing good business: people smugglers. The BBC gained rare access to one - we will call him Abdul (not his real name).
Abdul said a trip out of Afghanistan into Iran, Turkey and ultimately Europe costs between $5,000 and $7,000 (Â£3,250 to Â£4,550).
Abdul gets 10%, the rest goes to other smugglers in the network and pays for transportation. Migrants pay a deposit and their families pay the balance when they reach their destination.
The journey is fraught with danger, something Abdul said he did not hide.
"The most dangerous part is between Turkey and Greece. People get shot by police and sometimes the boats capsize. But Allah guarantees safety, not me," he said.
People from all walks of life and various parts of the country seek him out, he said, but he will not take them if they are unhealthy, too old, with small children or pregnant.
Abdul seems conflicted about what he does - he feels he is helping people, but also acknowledges he is taking their money and sending them to an uncertain fate.
"I smuggled my own three sons. I miss them a lot and I get upset when I see parents crying. I don't like my job very much you know. I feel guilty sometimes," he said.
Standing outside the passport office on a chilly Kabul morning, it is easy to see why people like Abdul are in business.
Queues have already started forming. People crouch on car bonnets filling in forms. Everyone wants to leave - and most don't want to come back.
Arif Mohamady, in his late 20s, is angry and frustrated.
"There are no jobs here, no security and lots of corruption. I'd rather live in an infidel country," he said.
"In 2007 my father was killed in a suicide bombing. My mother and brother were killed by the Taliban. I know it's a dangerous journey but I'd rather die on the way than stay in Afghanistan."
Despite the overwhelming sense of despair, some take a more hopeful view.
A group of young people have started a digital campaign called "Afghanistan Needs You".
Shakib Mohsanyar, 23, said they wanted to stop the brain drain, while Sharam Gulzad, 26, said many Afghans had unrealistic expectations about life abroad.
"I was in Germany and I saw Afghans begging for the first time there. It was heartbreaking. People think once they arrive things will get better. They won't," he said.
Both acknowledged that the problems of corruption, lack of jobs and insecurity are all too real.
"When you go out in the morning you don't know if you're coming back home in the evening," said Mr Gulzad.
"But this is the risk we take. We do have potential. This is not the end of Afghanistan. If we take responsibility and action we will change this country."

article He laid a wreath of white roses at Srebrenica's memorial, alongside Bosniak leader Bakir Izetbegovic.
It was his first visit to the town since he was forced to flee in July.
About 8,000 Muslims were killed in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian war.
Security measures were tight around the memorial and cemetery, just outside Srebrenica, as Mr Vucic paid his respects on Wednesday.
Mr Vucic was also set to speak at an economic conference during his visit.
Srebrenica's Muslim mayor, Camil Durakovic, who joined Mr Vucic at the memorial, said he respected him for returning to the town, according to Serbian media.
He said he was a "brave man" whose visit signified a more positive future for the town.
Mr Vucic fled a ceremony marking the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre on 11 July after people threw water bottles and stones at him.
Speaking in Belgrade afterwards, Mr Vucic said his glasses had been smashed in the incident but he was otherwise unhurt.
Ahead of his latest visit, he called for improved ties between Serbs and Muslims, and announced that Serbia would invest in development projects in Srebrenica.
The Serbian and Bosnian governments held their first joint session in Sarajevo on 4 November.
The Bosnian War saw Bosnian Serb forces, backed by Serbia, fighting the Muslim-led Bosnian government.
In July 1995, thousands seeking shelter in what was supposed to be a UN refuge in Srebrenica were shot dead. It was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
The ethnic Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) are descended from Bosnian Slavs who adopted Islam under Ottoman Turkish rule in the Middle Ages.
Mr Vucic is a former radical Serb nationalist who served under Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the late 1990s.
He is now a pro-Western politician seeking to steer Serbia into the European Union.
His government managed to secure support from its ally Russia to veto a UN resolution calling the events in Srebrenica a genocide in July.

The former Newcastle forward has been plagued by injuries since completing a £15m move from Liverpool in June 2013, but he marked his 50th Premier League appearance since then with the second top-flight treble of his career.

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic added: "Andy Carroll has everything. It's impossible to stop him.
"Watch how many times he tried to get the ball off them. He was keeping the ball, laying it off.
"Heading - he's maybe the best in the world. He has to stay away from those injuries. He's professional but he's got to be totally dedicated to his career and football."
Former Republic of Ireland and Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson on Match of the Day 2 Extra
"Andy Carroll is way down the list of strikers England have got at their disposal. They have a real luxury of strikers. How often does Carroll do what he can do best for West Ham? Taking him to the Euros would be like going back to the dark ages.
"Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck - they are all better players and the game is completely different now. It's not just whack it into the middle and fight for it. When has Carroll ever really been outstanding?"
Former Celtic and Bolton manager Neil Lennon on BBC Radio 5 live
"I would (take him), yes. He's my type of centre-forward. The big man was really up for it and he's been magnificent.
"With 10 minutes to go in an England game, he could be an option for Roy Hodgson."
Theo Walcott, 2006 World Cup: Arsenal paid £10m to sign Walcott from Southampton in January 2006. He failed to make a single top-flight appearance for the Gunners in the remainder of the 2005-06 season, but England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson made him England's youngest international at the age of 17 years and 75 days, and then took him to the World Cup in Germany. Walcott did not play a single minute at the tournament.
Steve Bull, 1990 World Cup: Bull scored 102 goals in two seasons to help Wolves to the Fourth Division and Third Division titles. That form convinced England manager Bobby Robson to call up the striker, who scored on his debut against Scotland in 1989. Bull, whose limited top-flight experience came early in his career at West Bromwich Albion, was included in the squad for the World Cup in Italy. He made four appearances at the tournament - but did not score a goal.
Jack Butland, Euro 2012: Goalkeeper Butland was called up by Hodgson because of John Ruddy's injury and went to Poland and Ukraine as England's third-choice goalkeeper, despite having not played a top-flight game at that stage.

article "I have left the Tardis - it's happened," she told BBC Radio 1 on Friday, following reports earlier this week. "I've filmed my last scenes."
After three years on the show, Coleman revealed her exit would air on BBC One "at some point this season".
She will play Queen Victoria from the age of 18 as she ascends to the throne.
The actress said she was "delighted" to be starring in "ambitious" ITV drama Victoria, which will chart the early years of the monarch's 63-year reign and her courtship and marriage to Prince Albert.
"She is a vivid, strong, inspirational and utterly fascinating woman in British history and I can't wait to tell her story," said Coleman.
The actress, who has also starred in Death Comes to Pemberley, Dancing on the Edge and ITV soap Emmerdale, first joined Doctor Who in 2012 alongside former Doctor Matt Smith.
She told Radio 1 Breakfast show host Nick Grimshaw it had been "emotional" leaving the show and filming her last scenes as Clara Oswald with current Doctor Peter Capaldi.
"It's been in the works for a very long time," she said, "[Writer] Steven [Moffat] and I sat down a year and a half ago and tried to work out the best place to do it and tell a really good story.
"We're not going to give any details but it will happen at some point this season... We worked out a really good story arc out so hopefully people will love it."
Coleman is about to start filming ITV's Victoria in locations around the North of England. It is being made by the producers of Poldark and has been written by acclaimed novelist Daisy Goodwin who makes her screenwriting debut with the series.
"I needed to learn to waltz, play Beethhoven," Coleman said of the role on Radio 1, "It's really fun, it's like bootcamp."
Queen Victoria, who was the UK's longest serving monarch until being overtaken by Elizabeth II earlier this month, has previously been portrayed on screen by Emily Blunt in 2009 film Young Victoria.
Coleman said she was looking forward to getting started but that it had been a tough decision to quit Doctor Who.
"There are not a lot of jobs where you get to have an alien as your best mate and get to run away from monsters... it's been so much fun, I love it," she said.
"It's such a unique beast it's been really special."
The ninth series of Doctor Who, which will be Coleman's last, debuts on BBC One tomorrow night, Saturday 19 September.
"I think I'm in denial," added Coleman. "I see Peter all the time and I still see Matt all the time, so I kind of believe I still have the keys to the Tardis."

Ms Maynard said the former England captain greeted them, got in his car and returned 10 minutes later with cups of tea and coffee.
"We were both very amused and flattered," she said.
Ms Maynard said she had been trying to keep her patient warm as they waited for an ambulance near Endsleigh Street.
"All of a sudden, I looked up and saw someone who looked like David Beckham walking past us," she said.
"He said hello and got in his car. I said to the man I was treating, 'I think that was David Beckham'. Ten minutes later, he came back with a cup of coffee for me and a tea for the patient.
"It was awful cycling around in the cold today and I couldn't believe it when he came back with some hot drinks - I was so chuffed."
London Ambulance Service said Beckham had shown he "respects hard-working paramedics and even a gesture as small as buying a cup of coffee makes our crews feel appreciated".
The patient was taken to hospital where he was treated for minor injuries.

Hamilton added: "The car feels good but the others are much closer this weekend. It's always the case here.
"We'll still be fighting. We just need to work hard and find out where the time is."
Ricciardo said he believed Mercedes had plenty in hand.
"I hope this is their real pace," said the Australian. "But I am sure they will turn it up and find a way. I am sure Mercedes will fool everyone.
"We will aim for [pole]. Whether we will get it or not is another thing. We will do what we can to get as far up the grid as we can possibly get."
Four-time world champion Vettel said: "It was a good day for us. The car seems to work and we can still improve.
"Obviously the Mercedes will be quick. I don't know what happened to them today; they looked a bit slow.
"But I'm sure they will change it for Saturday. We know some of the Mercedes team usually don't show everything on Friday."
Singapore has been on the Formula 1 calendar only since 2008, but already it has become a modern classic.
The key was to hold the street race in the south-east Asian city state at night.
The combination of futuristic skyscrapers across the cityscape, colonial buildings lining the circuit and the lighting on the paintwork of the cars is stunning.
The tight and twisty track does not always produce the greatest race, but as a challenge it is among the toughest in the sport - the combination of tropical heat and humidity, the bumpy track and the longest event on the calendar tests the drivers to their limit.

The 54-year-old has already been sacked from Dorset Police for gross misconduct following a force disciplinary hearing.
Dorchester Crown Court heard he had been receiving psychiatric treatment.
Smith, who also admitted a charge of using the police national computer for personal reasons, was suspended from duty after being charged in September.
He has been issued with an indefinite restraining order preventing him from contacting his victim.
The court heard he bombarded her with threatening text messages and phone calls between January 2013 and September 2014.
Supt Peter Windle, of Dorset Police's professional standards department, said: "Our thoughts and sympathies are with the victim in this case.
"We would like to thank her for her bravery in coming forward and reporting these offences and supporting the prosecution.
"Allan Smith was working in a position of trust as a frontline officer. He betrayed that trust and let down his colleagues and the police service.
"His arrest and prosecution reinforces the fact that Dorset Police expects the highest standards of professionalism and integrity from its staff."

article I admit that consuming alcohol can be involved, just occasionally.  But normally that's only after the cameras have been packed away. Not so this time.
My twin brother, Dr Xand and I have a long standing debate:
Given that blokes like us are "allowed" three to four units of alcohol a day, is it better to get a whole week's worth out of the way in one binge and give your liver a chance to recover afterwards?
Or to spread the booze across the week, just a couple every night, but never giving your liver a rest?
It seemed like a question BBC's flagship science show Horizon could answer, so we shared it with them… and walked straight into a serious challenge.
The first thing we found out as we started to look into this idea, was that there's very little medical evidence supporting the recommended daily guidelines.
This was a worry from the start - what were we going to find out, and how long would we need to find it?
Obviously you can't do this sort of thing without guidance, so we were pleased that Horizon put us in the hands of a team of specialists at the Royal Free Hospital.

Source: NHS Choices
They had some experience of this kind of thing after a running a pilot study the year before.
With their help we devised a plan. Xand and I needed to get our livers to a level playing field to start with, and that lead to the first hardship … a whole month completely dry. No cheating.
After a very dull month off the booze, Xand and I went to the Royal Free for the first of many medicals, a kind of liver-MOT.
Your biological set-up
Find out what traits make you more or less prone to the effects of alcohol.
BBC iWonder – Why do some people get drunk more quickly than others?
This is actually where it started to get really serious.
As I watched Xand get pricked and poked and scanned, my mind ran through the gallons of beer and wine that must have been through my body, and the hammering my liver must have taken through medical school.
I actually grew quite apprehensive about the results - of course all I really wanted to hear was that my liver was healthier than his.
But I needn't have worried. Incredibly, both Xand and I passed the medicals with flying colours.
After one month off the booze our livers were soft, healthy, and most important for the test ahead, they were identical.
But then the drinking started.
I was pretty pleased with my lot, an enforced three units  - one big (250ml) glass of wine - every night for a month.
To be honest, that's probably less than I normally drink over an average month, but I don't think I've ever gone so long without a day off.
I was genuinely interested to find out whether I'd start to go off the idea after a week or so. On the other hand, Xand was only going to be allowed to drink once a week.
Xand and I met up for the first session. While I supped my three units, he was to down a whole week's worth - 21 units  - in that one night.
On camera. I think it's fair to say we were both quite looking forward to it.
We opted for vodka, as it was going to be easier for him to drink 21 shots over the few hours we had with the camera crew than eight or nine average-strength pints.
And then one of the strangest nights of socialising I've ever experienced began. Basically we sat alone in a bar, with a crew of burly camera men watching, while I suffered the company of my increasingly incoherent brother as he consumed three quarters of a bottle of vodka.
I went through so many emotions that night. It was funny to begin with. Xand really was pretty far gone. But it really made me think about what the alcohol was doing to his liver and his heart and his brain - and what it does to mine every time I overdo it like that.
By the time I got Xand home, he was pretty helpless. I had to play the responsible brother and help him get to bed. And at that stage I was starting to get concerned for him - but the next day was even more sobering.
Luckily for Xand the camera crew didn't arrive until late in the morning so he had a bit of a lie in.
But when we looked at all the readings we'd taken, he'd clearly been in a dangerous state the night before. He was actually at his worst a few hours after we'd gone to sleep, when the level of alcohol in his blood was, according to the text books, enough to put him at danger of death.
That wiped the smiles off our faces - along with his inability to recall anything about the journey home, or his descent into a blubbering idiot. And this was just the first of four binges he had ahead of him.
While Xand started his week-long recovery, I got into my daily routine of three units a night. To start with it wasn't difficult. In fact it felt odd to stop at just three units.
That's precisely the point where I normally start feeling such a warm glow I think "Ooh yeah, come on let's have another …" So it was actually quite frustrating having to stop there.
What I did notice was that my work started to suffer quite quickly. At the time, I was processing data in a laboratory, so it was quite easy to measure my productivity.
Although I didn't feel much different I was certainly achieving less, and that really surprised me.
After that, I started to find drinking a bit of a chore, like taking medicine. And so by the second week I began finding ways to add some variety - I spread the drinks out over a day, had a glass of wine at lunch for example. But it wasn't quite as easy as I'd expected it to be.
Plus, I began to feel protective of Xand, especially when it was apparent how much he came to relish his binges after six days of recovery.
The results of the final tests truly shocked us. And the medics. Sure, Xand's binges did him no good at all. But they actually affected him for many days afterwards, meaning he never fully recovered between binges.
But even more shocking were my results - which were almost as bad as Xand's. I got the feeling my liver had basically returned to its normal state- and it wasn't any better than Xand's binge-bashed liver.
So what now? To binge or not to binge? Well there are two things I learned from our test.
First, the current guidelines of three to four units a day for a man like me need looking at. It's a good job they're under review right now, and I look forward to seeing the results announced this summer.
Second - our livers can bounce back, but they need much longer to recover. This was so clear, that the medics behind our test have launched a full clinical study.
They're measuring the effects of a dry month in well over 100 volunteers. Watch this space to find out what that study reveals.

article The Association of Quality Education (AQE) and the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC) have issued a joint statement announcing the move.
"We believe this to be in the best interest of pupils, parents and schools," it said.
Sources told the BBC that talks would begin in early March.
The aim, they said, was to have a common test in place by November 2019.
Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the move, saying he hoped to see "a common entrance test within the very near future".
In turn, the AQE and PPTC statement said they appreciated his "input and support".
In October 2016, the minister appointed Prof Peter Tymms, from Durham University's school of education, to begin a process to find a common test.
Prof Tymms' subsequent report to the Department of Education (DE) has been obtained by the BBC.
It provides an outline of the form a common test could take, although it states that this is "solely intended to form the basis for initial discussion".
It suggests that:
However, the report also recommends that pupils should continue to sit the tests in post-primary schools rather than their own primary schools.
Currently, primary school children aged 10 and 11 can choose to sit either test, both tests, or decide not to sit them.
It is estimated that about 2,000 pupils sit both tests.
They are used to decide which pupils are admitted to the vast majority of grammar schools.
However, there are some significant differences between the current AQE and PPTC tests.
Parents pay a fee to enter their child for the AQE tests, unless they are eligible for free school meals.
In 2016 that fee was Â£46, whereas PPTC do not charge a fee for entrance to their test.
The formats of the tests also differ.
The PPTC test involves two multiple choice papers taken on one day set by GL Assessment, a company specialising in educational tests.
The AQE test involves three papers taken over three Saturdays which pose a series of English and Maths questions and tasks.
Prof Tymms' report acknowledges that these represent "major differences of opinion" between the two testing organisations.
"But there is good will and it does not, to the outsiders who wrote this report, seem that the two groups are very far apart," he states.
Academic selection, however, remains a contentious issue.
Recently, a policy group run by the Department of Education (DE) criticised the impact of selection.
A significant number of children, though, enter the transfer tests each year.

Full-back Paul McGinn crashed in the opening goal after running on to a neat Gary Harkins pass.
Harkins then crossed for Kane Hemmings to double the hosts' advantage from close range on 29 minutes.
Greg Stewart slammed in a shot after the interval and fired home a late free-kick after Kevin Holt had tucked away a rebound.
Dundee dominated from the outset with the Championship visitors struggling to cope with the movement of Stewart, Hemmings and Rory Loy up front, while Harkins was given far too much room to dictate play from the middle of the park.
Paul Hartley's side had been held to a goalless draw in the rain-soaked original tie but this was a one-sided contest.
The breakthrough came on 16 minutes and from an unlikely source.
Harkins played in a reverse pass for McGinn who beat goalkeeper Mark Brown at his near post with a fierce strike for his first goal of the season.
The Sons squandered their best chance within a minute of the restart as Scott Taggart's cutback fell perfectly for Jordan Kirkpatrick but the midfielder rushed his shot and the ball fell tamely into the arms of Scott Bain.
Another blank leaves Dumbarton with just one goal in their last six outings, while Hemmings grabbed his 13th in 11 games after more good work from Harkins.
The midfielder clipped the ball into the near post where the in-form striker slid the ball beyond Brown for his 19th of the season.
Stewart had been seeing plenty of the ball and he fired in number three five minutes into the second half.
The striker ghosted into the box from the right before sliding the ball into the left hand corner of the goal as the Dumbarton defence looked on.
Loy worked tirelessly throughout and looked to have won a penalty when he tumbled to the ground after a challenge by Darren Barr.
But referee Stephen Finnie stunned the home crowd by booking the former Rangers and Falkirk striker, the third yellow card of the evening for alleged simulation.
The fourth goal arrived with 10 minutes remaining as Brown saved from substitute Craig Wighton only to be beaten by left-back Holt who was following up.
The rout was complete in stoppage time when man-of-the-match Stewart fired home a free kick from 25 yards, with the defensive wall falling apart.
It rounded off a fine evening for Stewart and Hartley's men, who will travel full of confidence to Ibrox for their first visit since 2004.
Dundee's Paul Hartley: "It was professional, it was clinical. It was a good night for us.
"I thought our movement was terrific, we had some great combination play.
"It looks like a penalty when Loy is caught in the box but we're not complaining too much.
"It's great to be in the quarter-finals but we have some important games before that."
Dumbarton's Stephen Aitken: "We're bitterly disappointed in the manner in which we lost the game.
"Dundee were ruthless but they are cheap goals from our point of view. The reality is Dundee were better than us on the night.
"We stick together, we have done all season, and we'll bounce back."

Former Chelsea youth coach Drummy signed a two-year deal to replace Mark Yates as Reds boss in April 2016.
Crawley, who host Mansfield in their final game of the season on Saturday, are 21st in League Two and seven points clear of the relegation zone.
Drummy, who had no previous managerial experience in the EFL, won 15 of his 54 games in charge of the club.
A club statement said: "The club would like to thank Dermot and Matt for their hard work in the last 13 months and wish them all the best for their future careers."
BBC Sussex & BBC Surrey Crawley commentator John Barnett
"The appointment of Drummy, whose background was as a vastly experienced development coach, was an interesting one, not least in terms of the style of football he had pledged to instil.
"The early signs were promising, with the club reaching fifth place by mid-October and fans clearly appreciative of the brand of football on offer.
"Despite some poor away form, the home record remained strong into February, but once a losing sequence at the Checkatrade Stadium stalled their progress somewhat, the passing game seemed to abate.
"Just three wins since mid-January started to frustrate the supporters, and clearly Turkish owner Ziya Eren, who parts company with a second manager in little over a year.
"Drummy's contribution to matters off the field and the club engaging with its fans should not be overlooked, and some important groundwork and more has been laid in that respect."

article Shiromini Satkunarajah, 20, who was born in Sri Lanka but has lived in the UK for eight years, is due to finish her electrical engineering degree this summer.
She was arrested on Tuesday and taken to a detention centre to await deportation on 28 February.
The Home Office said it did not routinely comment on individual cases.
Miss Satkunarajah arrived in the UK in 2009 as a dependant on her father's student visa.
He died in 2011 but she and her mother were allowed to stay while she completed her secondary education and started a university course.
Further grants of Leave to Remain and of asylum were denied, but Miss Satkunarajah has been allowed to stay in the UK while appealing.
On 21 February, she was told that her asylum application had been rejected and has now launched a petition calling on the home secretary to reconsider.
More than 11,500 people had signed it on Saturday night.
"I was handed the refusal letter which states 'You do not have a right to appeal or administrative review against the decision to refuse your application'," she said.
"I seek for help from everyone to overturn the decision to deport me on 28 February."
A family member, who asked not to be named, told BBC Wales: "It is not fair that she only has three months left to finish her degree. At least let her finish that.
"Shiromini came here when she was 12, her friends and family are here. She knows no-one and has nothing at all in Sri Lanka."
Iestyn Pierce, head of electrical engineering at Bangor University, described her as an "exceptionally able and diligent" student on course for a first class honours degree.
"Shiromini figures among the very best students, having secured very high grades in her examinations this January," he added.
"If allowed to graduate she would be sure to be a valuable member of the workforce in what is a world-wide shortage subject."
Student groups and the acting Bishop of London, Pete Broadbent, have also spoken out on Miss Satkunarajah's behalf.
Bishop Broadbent said: "To deport her weeks before she finishes her degree and to remove her from the community that supports her seems draconian and harms both her and our church community.
"I would urge the authorities to exercise their discretion to enable this bright young woman to finish her degree."
Arfon MP Hywel Williams accused the Home Office of showing "heartless indifference" to Miss Satkunarajah.
"Her imminent deportation is not only unjust and unfair but will deprive Wales and indeed the UK economy of the contribution she will make," he said.
"Sri Lanka is still a very dangerous place and Shiromini has had no real ties with the country."
A Home Office spokesperson said: "The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it, and every case is carefully considered on its individual merits."

article Instead, a study concluded, the only way to prevent a hangover is to drink less alcohol.
More than 800 students were asked how they tried to relieve hangover symptoms, but neither food nor water was found to have any positive effect.
The findings are being presented at a conference in Amsterdam.
A team of international researchers from the Netherlands and Canada surveyed students' drinking habits to find out whether hangovers could be eased or if some people were immune to them.
Among 826 Dutch students, 54% ate food after drinking alcohol, including fatty food and heavy breakfasts, in the hope of staving off a hangover.
With the same aim, more than two-thirds drank water while drinking alcohol and more than half drank water before going to bed.
Although these groups showed a slight improvement in how they felt compared with those who hadn't drunk water, there was no real difference in the severity of their hangovers.
Previous research suggests that about 25% of drinkers claim never to get hangovers.
So the researchers questioned 789 Canadian students about their drinking in the previous month and the hangovers they experienced, finding that those who didn't get a hangover simply consumed "too little alcohol to develop a hangover in the first place".
Of those students who drank heavily, with an estimated blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.2%, almost no-one was immune to hangovers.
According to lead author Dr Joris Verster, from Utrecht University, the relationship was pretty straightforward.
"The more you drink, the more likely you are to get a hangover.
"Drinking water may help against thirst and a dry mouth, but it will not take away the misery, the headache and the nausea."
Dr Verster said part of the problem was that scientists still do not know what causes a hangover.
"Research has concluded that it's not simply dehydration - we know the immune system is involved, but before we know what causes it, it's very unlikely we'll find an effective cure."
He said the next step was to carry out more controlled trials on hangovers.
Dr Michael Bloomfield, from University College, London, said the economic costs of alcohol abuse ran into hundreds of billions of euros every year.
"It's therefore very important to answer simple questions like, 'How do you avoid a hangover?'
"Whilst further research is needed, this new research tells us that the answer is simple - drink less."
The paper is presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference.

Querrey, seeded 28th, completed a 7-6 (8-6) 6-1 3-6 7-6 (7-5) third-round win after rain had suspended play on Friday evening.
It was the Serb's first loss at a major since the 2015 French Open final.
Britain's Andy Murray, seeded second, made it into round four with a 6-3 7-5 6-2 win over Australia's John Millman.
Djokovic had hoped to win his third straight Wimbledon title and secure the third leg of a calendar Slam.
The 29-year-old has already won the Australian and French Opens this year, and was also trying to become only the second man to win five successive major titles.
Asked whether he was 100% healthy, Djokovic said: "Not really. But it's not the place and time to talk about it. The opponent was playing on a very high level and he deserved to win."
"It's incredible, especially to do it here at Wimbledon," said 28-year-old Querrey after ending one of the most dominant runs in tennis history.
"I'm so ecstatic, so happy. I played the break points well and every time he had a break point I was able to come up with a big serve.
"He came out and got the first four games, fortunately for me we had another rain delay and I got to regroup. I'm just taking it one round at a time, I'm not even sure who I'm playing next."
The 6ft 6in Querrey has a huge serve, and grass-court pedigree as a former Queen's Club champion, but there was no reason to think he might be the man to finally derail Djokovic.
Even when the world number 41 headed off with a two-set lead on Friday evening, having played superbly, there were few at the All England Club confidently backing him to finish the job.
Djokovic had looked strangely out of sorts in the first chapter of the contest but he took advantage of an edgy Querrey to build a quick 4-0 lead on Saturday's resumption.
The third set was duly taken either side of another rain delay but try as he might, the 12-time Grand Slam champion could not break away in the fourth.
The pair shared 16 break points before Djokovic finally moved ahead with a forehand for 5-4 - only to give the break straight back with a poor attempt at a drop volley.
When the rain returned just after Querrey had held for a 6-5 lead, it left Djokovic heading for the locker room knowing he would have to serve to stay in the match on the resumption.
A little over an hour later, the top seed played a nerveless service game to force the tie-break but once again he could not find his usual clinical edge.
A 3-1 lead disappeared and despite Djokovic saving a first match point with an ace, it was Querrey who was leaping in the air in celebration when the Serb pulled a forehand wide on the second.
Tim Henman, four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist:
"You were waiting for Sam Querrey's level to drop and it never did. That was when you saw the first signs of Djokovic not engaging mentally.
"When we came back after the rain delay that was when you felt Querrey was aware that he had something to lose. Then he lost the first four games in a row in that third set.
"Once it got to the end of that fourth set, and Djokovic was serving for the set, you thought that was the moment he would turn it around. Querrey always had belief that he could hang in there and all credit to him.
"Querrey had to give himself an opportunity and he hit 31 aces. Djokovic is probably the best returner in the history of the game.
"So to serve as well as he did, as aggressive as he did and keep going in the important moments was unbelievable.
"If I was going to question something about Djokovic, it was more mental than physical. There was a lot of eye contact with the box.
"Normally he is so clear in his mind and the consistency of his performances in the majors has been unbelievable. It was a bizarre performance."

article Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) found that one in four of those under the age of 30 is at risk of financial hardship.
Its report said the poverty faced by young adults contrasts with an improving picture for other age groups.
For those over the age of 65, poverty rates were found to have fallen by almost half.
Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil welcomed the report and called on businesses to follow the Scottish government in paying the living wage to get people out of poverty.
Labour's shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran said the report "has shown that the Tories have completely failed Scotland's young people".
The JRF report, Monitoring Poverty and Social Exclusion in Scotland, found a rising number of young people in poverty and persistently high levels of disadvantage in health, education and work.
JRF chief executive Julia Unwin said: "Falls in child and pensioner poverty over the past decade in Scotland show that poverty can be reduced.
"But sustained action must be taken to stop a lack of high-quality work, and a shortage of affordable homes from trapping a generation of young people in poverty.
"All of us in government and local government as well as employers, housing providers and the NHS, need a shared focus to alleviate the impacts of poverty across all age groups."
The key findings of the report include:
Dr Peter Kenway, director of the New Policy Institute and author of the report, added: "Organisations across Scotland, local councils, the NHS and businesses are accepting a responsibility for acting against poverty and are making plans accordingly.
"The challenge is to turn words into deeds. Involving people with direct experience of poverty themselves is vital to this."
The report recommends more encouragement for employers to pay the living wage; better training for people in low-paid work and a reduction in the use of sanctions against benefit claimants.
Labour's shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran said a Labour government "would invest Â£1bn for more opportunity for Scotland's future - our young people".
Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil said the JRF "acknowledges the positive effects of the Scottish government's effort to mitigate the worst of the UK Government's welfare cuts".

article The girl, known as X, will be moved to a special unit on Thursday after doctors managed to find her a place.
Sir James Munby, head of the family courts in England and Wales, said the provision of care "should not be dependent" on legal involvement.
The secure unit where the 17-year-old has been living has spent Â£125,000 on extra staff to care for her.
The unit - which has not been named - said the Youth Justice Board "failed" to provide additional resources to maintain X's safety despite repeated requests.
The details were revealed in the latest judgement in her case.
Three social care staff were said to be off work suffering from "stress and anxiety" due to the "unusual experiences" they had observed with the girl.
Sir James, who previously criticised the lack of supervision available for the girl, said the latest development was "not a matter for congratulation".
He spoke out last Thursday to say there would be "blood on our hands" if the teenager did not receive adequate supervision upon her release from secure custody.
He made his comments after finding out a secure unit place had not been found for the girl, who had made several suicide attempts.
In Sir James' judgement, he said: "I feel shame and embarrassment; shame, as a human being, as a citizen and as an agent of the State... that I can do no more for X."
The judgement in the case of X - who is in the formal care of Cumbria County Council - revealed she was convicted at a youth court and has been detained in custody for almost six months.
An earlier ruling heard how unit staff had witnessed "a profoundly disturbing and distressing scene when X self-harmed by repeatedly banging her head and face against the wall".
Staff said she must be checked every 50 seconds when she is in the shower.
The unit has said 13 young people who were also being detained at the centre complained the quality of the care they were receiving was "in breach of their statutory rights" because staff had to attend to X and had less time to organise activities for them.
Following the latest ruling, the judge said X should not be "privileged" because her case came before a senior judge.
He added: "I emphasise this because a mass of informed, if anecdotal, opinion indicates that X's is not an isolated case and that there are far too many young women in similar predicaments. How are they to be protected?"
Sir James said the publication of his judgment last Thursday had "prompted substantial coverage", with his "blood on our hands" warning making front pages.
He added: "This seems to have had some effect."

article The revelation came during questioning of a senior detective who led the investigation into the murders.
Ten Protestant men were shot dead by the IRA in the attack in County Armagh in 1976.
They were shot after gunmen stopped their bus on their way home from work.
The inquest heard on Wednesday about a list of names of those involved in the attack, supplied by a self-confessed IRA man in December 1976.
Among those named on the list was a man given the cypher "s104".
He had  "usually travelled" on the minibus with the other workmen said a barrister for the families of the victims.
This could mean that he was involved in setting up his workmates for slaughter, he added.
The list of names was put to the detective who led the investigation following the murders.
Det Ch Insp James Mitchell said he could not confirm whether or not he had seen it before, but he identified all of those named as members of the Provisional IRA.
He added that most, if not all of them, would have been living in the Republic of Ireland and so would have been beyond the reach of the RUC as on the whole the government in the Republic of Ireland were not co-operating when it came to extradition.
The former senior officer was asked about his resourcing, given that it has been reported that 1,000 officers are involved in the recent Manchester suicide attack investigation.
He said the manpower available to him was totally inadequate with nine additional detectives sent from Belfast for only a period of weeks.
Last Friday Det Ch Insp Mitchell apologised to the victims' families for not getting the satisfaction they had hoped for.
He said the "workload at the time" and "depleted resources" led to weaknesses in the investigation.
In 2011, a review of the case was carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).
The HET investigation established that no evidence remained.
It also said that some of the original evidence had been destroyed in a fire at the laboratory eight months after the killings.

article The broadcast regulator's decision is a blow to the party's bid to be included in the TV election leader debates.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said he does not want to take part in the debates unless the Greens are included.
The current proposals only include the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
Ofcom published a consultation on which parties should be accorded "major status" ahead of the general election.
Those which are granted that status are entitled to at least two party election broadcasts on each of the TV and radio channels covered by the system.
In addition, the BBC, ITV, Sky and Channel 4 have proposed three leaders' debates with combinations of David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. The Greens, who are not included in the broadcasters' initial plans, are threatening legal action.
Ofcom said the Green Party had not demonstrated significant support in previous general elections.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said Ofcom was ignoring the Greens' strong support in sections of the community.
At the moment the regulator's list includes the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats across Great Britain, the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales.
In Northern Ireland, the major parties are the Alliance Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Fein, the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party.
The regulator is seeking views on whether others should be included in its lists for the elections on 7 May and says it thinks UKIP will qualify in England and Wales. A final decision is due in March.
Its initial view is that the Green Party has "not demonstrated significant past electoral support in general elections".
If UKIP was included it would be the first time this has been the case at a general election campaign. Ofcom pointed to the "significant support" for UKIP in the 2014 European and local elections and to the party's two parliamentary by-election victories.
"This is the first time nationally that UKIP has been recognised as a major party. I am very pleased indeed," UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the Telegraph.
Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she was "deeply disappointed" by the draft Ofcom ruling.
"The media regulator has failed to grasp the fast-moving, fluid state of British politics today, and that fact that voters are seeking out the choice of real change," she said.
"Ofcom should not be making that option harder to find, but ensuring that voters have the chance to hear and judge the full range of political options today.
"It is also important to note how Ofcom is ignoring the strong support for the Green Party in particular sections of the community, particularly the young and students. Their engagement in the political process is vital for the future, and they will rightly expect to hear their views represented and explored in the mainstream media."
Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, a prominent environmentalist, joined criticism of what he called a "disgraceful, indefensible decision by Ofcom".
Ofcom also considered and rejected the idea of recommending major party status for Northern Ireland's TUV party.

article "I am really proud of Bafana Bafana. Yes, I was hoping for a win but they played really well and have done the country proud," said Isaac Maphalle, 21, after the final whistle.
The past week has been particularly impressive here - as though the reality of what it means to hold an event of this magnitude has finally sunk in. The entire country is drunk on World Cup fever.
Words can scarcely describe the electricity in this country at the moment.
The energy has even spread to South Africa's poorest areas.  Diepsloot is located near the affluent suburb of Fourways on the outskirts of the city.
"The game was fantastic. A draw is okay, we're happy Bafana Bafana didn't lose," said local resident Lefa Pienaar.
Just two years ago, there was a violent outbreak of xenophobia here, leaving many foreign nationals without homes and several dead - but today all of that seems forgotten.
In pictures: World Cup voices
Though the streets are lined with shacks and poverty remains evident, today it was all about the game.
Local residents, other South Africans and foreign nationals danced side-by-side in a local park where some 3,000 people had gathered to watch the match between South Africa and Mexico.
"The issue of xenophobia is no longer bad - football has unified the community," said community leader David Maseko.
The park was a sea of colour as thousands of fans - many of them wearing the Bafana Bafana colours, green and gold - watched the game on a giant screen.
Colourful vuvuzelas, blankets made in the colours of the national flag and multi-coloured wigs added to the scene.
A heavy police presence kept an eye on the afternoon's proceedings, with officers carefully searching all those who walked into the park.
"Yes there are problems here like poverty and no jobs but we are putting them aside for Bafana Bafana, we are focusing on football. It is all about them and the World Cup," says 18-year old Kgofelo Mahlatse, who is struggling to get into university because of a lack of money.
Large crowds cheered as the referee's whistle announced the start of the much-awaited match being held at Soccer City stadium on the other side of Johannesburg.
"It is here," some screamed as the game started.
But a few minutes into the game, the noise levels dropped as thousands of eyes were glued on the screen - nervousness etched on many of their faces - a theme that dominated the first half.
A few minutes after the start of the second half, Siphiwe Tshabalala scored the first goal of the match, causing an eruption of screams - many jumping up and down and throwing themselves on the floor in excitement.
Although Mexico went on to equalise, the euphoria was still evident at the end of the game.
South Africa has a lot of challenges. It has one of the highest crime rates in the world, poverty still haunts many as the gap between the rich and the poor widens - but the country is nowhere near breaking point.
For now South Africa seems oblivious to its challenges, determined to savour the moment.
"We have waited for this moment for years. Win or lose, this World Cup is ours - we are behind Bafana all the way," said Monica Masisi, 48.
What made South Africa special was its ability to move past the negative and focus on what lay ahead, she said.
"Today we are able to celebrate our freedom as South Africans by hosting the world in our own country."
Many have speculated about the World Cup over the years, worried about the lack of infrastructure in Africa to host such an event.
Naysayers predicted that none of the 10 stadia would be ready on time and that the country would not be able to accommodate the thousands who would be descending on its shores.
But over the past few years South Africa has surprised even itself by delivering world class stadia, hundreds of hotels and a multi-billion dollar railway system.
These will remain in the country long after the final whistle is blown.
Many South Africans believe one man should be thanked for bringing the World Cup to Africa - Nelson Mandela.
"This is a first for Africa and maybe the last. We owe Mandela a lot," says schoolgirl Lebohang Sekhu.
Mr Mandela was unable to attend the opening match as many had hoped due to the loss of his great-granddaughter Zenani, 13, who was killed in a car crash while returning from a World Cup concert in the early hours of Friday morning, but many here said they still felt the "Madiba magic".
"Mandela taught us unity - that's why we are here today as Africans. We are celebrating the match but our prayers are with him during this time," said Ms Mahlatse.
When Mr Mandela was released from prison in 1990, some believed there would be a civil war in South Africa but instead there was change of governance as democracy was ushered in.
The first fruits of South Africa's attempts at unity was the 1995 rugby World Cup, where black and white South Africans stood side by side cheering on the Springboks.
2010 has brought back many of those good old feelings.
Until now, football was seen as a black man's sport and rugby as a white man's sport, but the unity this football event has brought has blurred the lines between black and white and instilled a sense of national pride.
Whatever the outcome, Africa will be remembered as the continent where blacks and whites danced, cheered and cried along side each other - grateful to have been part of South Africa's golden moment.

article The contracts are part of £3bn already set aside to start work on the replacement of the UK's fleet of four Trident nuclear submarines by 2028.
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said this was "an important step" towards renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent.
The Conservatives are pressing ahead despite objections from the Lib Dems.
The Tories' coalition colleagues have long argued for a cheaper alternative to replacing the Royal Navy's ageing submarines that carry Britain's nuclear deterrent and which are due to reach the end of their lives in the next decade.
As part of the coalition agreement, the Conservatives said they would look at alternatives and delayed a final decision on replacing Trident until 2016, after the next general election.
But in reality the MoD is already pressing ahead with work on the next generation of nuclear armed submarines, says BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale.
The Lib Dems are expected to publish a review looking at other options.
The first Successor submarine is due to be delivered in 2028, replacing the Vanguard Class submarines which currently carry Trident, the UK's nuclear deterrent.
The largest contract, worth £328m, has been awarded to BAE Systems Maritime - Submarines, which will work on the overall submarine design.
Babcock has been awarded £15m and will focus on designing parts of the in-service support.
More than £4m has been awarded to Rolls-Royce which will be responsible for the integration of the reactor design.
The MoD said that although a decision on the final design and build would not be made until 2016, detailed work had to take place now to ensure that the Successor submarines would be the most technologically advanced.
Mr Hammond told MPs the contracts announced were a step towards ensuring the UK had a nuclear deterrent "into the 2060s".
Eric Grove, director of the University of Salford's Centre for International Security and War studies said: "It's without commitment in theory but of course it is with commitment in practice. We wouldn't be spending this kind of money on design if it didn't look as if it was going to go forward."
He added: "We have a world-class submarine-building industry in this country and this programme will help to sustain or create more than 1,900 jobs across the UK.
"By making the core equipment programme fully funded and affordable, we are able to confirm additional equipment projects which help safeguard our national security."
He has also included the final cost of the replacement submarines - expected to be at least £20bn - in his latest budget plans.
The first of the four Trident submarines had been due to leave service in 2022 but the government extended the vessels' lives as part of the 2010 defence and security review.
BAE Systems managing director John Hudson said the new contract would "help sustain the jobs of over 1,000 skilled employees currently working on the programme [and] also provides the opportunity to grow our workforce by a further 280 in 2012".
These jobs are based at its site in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, said: "The Royal Navy has been operating continuous at sea deterrent patrols for more than 40 years and the Successor submarines will allow us to do so well into the future with cutting edge equipment."
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described Britain's nuclear weapons as a "bottomless pit" for spending.
General secretary Kate Hudson said: "A majority of the public want to scrap Trident now. The last thing they want to do is replace it. And yet they are being forced to fund its replacement while they see local services cut.
"The sad truth is that, as shocking as today's announcement is, £350m is just a drop in the ocean compared with the total cost of replacing Trident, which will amount to well over £100bn over its lifecycle."
summary The UK has awarded two contracts worth £2.5bn to build a new nuclear submarine.

article Suso had looked set to be AC Milan's match-winning hero with two goals, before Perisic pounced in injury time.
Ex-Liverpool winger Suso curled home Milan's opener before Antonio Candreva smashed in an equaliser.
Suso scored again from a jinking run but Perisic turned home a corner from close range to deny Milan the chance to go 11 points above their rivals.
Read how the action unfolded here.
Former Lazio boss Piolo took charge of a Nerazzurri game for the first time, having been named Frank de Boer's replacement during the international break.
A derby defeat would have been the worst start imaginable, especially one that would have left them 11 points behind their rivals.
But Inter deserved their draw, with Candreva's first equaliser a brilliant 25-yard effort, and they took risks in the end, with goalkeeper Samir Handanovic coming up for the corner which Perisic converted.

article Sources cited in Belgian media say Abrini is also likely to be the "man in the hat" seen on CCTV  before the blasts in the Brussels airport departure hall on 22 March.
Prosecutors confirmed that several arrests had been made in connection with the Brussels attacks.
The attacks on the airport and a metro station left 32 dead.
The gun and bomb attacks in Paris on 13 November killed 130 people.
Although the Belgian federal prosecutor confirmed that "there have been several arrests in the course of the day in connection with the attacks on the airport and metro", they would give no further details.
Local media reports suggest that Abrini, on the run for five months, was arrested in the Anderlecht district of Brussels.
The Associated Press quoted French police as saying that he was one of the arrested men. He had not been directly linked to the Brussels attacks until today.
Some media say that one of the other men arrested is suspected of helping suicide bomber Khalid el-Bakraoui at the Maelbeek metro station, but this has not been confirmed.
Belgian authorities had on Thursday released new video footage of the "man in the hat", appealing for the public's help in finding him.
The individual in the footage was seen beside the two suicide bombers at Brussels airport. He left the airport shortly before the blasts.
Abrini, 31, a Belgian national of Moroccan origin, is believed to have been filmed at a petrol station with Salah Abdeslam, another arrested Paris attacks suspect, two days before the attacks there.
Abrini and brothers Salah and Brahim Abdeslam were all childhood friends from Brussels.
Abrini is believed to have driven twice with the brothers from Belgium to Paris and back on 10 and 11 November.
Salah Abdeslam was detained in Brussels in March, days before militants launched attacks in the Belgian capital.
Brahim Abdeslam blew himself up at the Comptoir Voltaire restaurant after a shooting spree.

article Gladys Tingle was seriously ill with double pneumonia when she was young, and was told she could not do any sport at school.
Now a grandmother, she started doing marathons in her 70s and is known for walking around her home in Horncastle in Lincolnshire every day.
She has raised thousands of pounds for Lincs and Notts Air Ambulance.
She intends to "power walk" the half marathon rather than running it.
"I go about three-and-a-half miles an hour, something like that," she said.
"It's like a power walk, between a run and a walk.
"I don't want anybody to walk with me. If people say 'Come on walk with me' I say 'No, you go your way and I'll go mine'."
Gladys has done the Great North Run at least ten times.
When she competes in events people shout "Go Glad Go" at her, because she wears a t-shirt printed with the slogan.
She is also used to cars beeping at her when she goes walking around Horncastle.
"You get a lot of cars peeping but I don't know who's in it because they are going fast," she said.

article The Vine star - real name Daniel O'Reilly - was recently seen in the ITV2 series Dapper Laughs: On The Pull.
He has provoked outrage with jokes about rape and homeless people.
An ITV spokesman told Newsbeat: "We have given careful thought to the recent criticism of the character Dapper Laughs, which has focused on his activities outside of the ITV2 programme.
"We have taken the decision that we will not be considering this show for a second series."
An online petition has been calling on ITV to scrap the show.
The man behind the campaign told Newsbeat the show wasn't risquÃ© comedy and described it as "dangerous".
Tom Zephyr - who asked us not to use his real name - said: "We need a civilised fightback against this 'laddish' culture".
His campaign said the Dapper Laughs show used "misogynistic views, all under the guise of harmless comedy" and argued that the comedian's work frequently depicted "real-life harassment of women".
"While I am glad that there will be no more Dapper Laughs on our screens, I cannot regard the petition a success until ITV recognise their errors. People are worried about lad culture in general, not just Dapper Laughs, and ITV haven't yet admitted that they failed their duty of responsibility towards their viewers."
ITV's decision comes as a video was posted online showing Dapper Laughs saying to an audience member that she was "gagging for a rape".
We've asked Daniel O'Reilly for an interview and are still waiting for a response.

article They will be presented with their awards by King Carl XVI of Sweden at a ceremony in Stockholm on 26 August.
The million kronor prize (Â£82,000) was founded 25 years ago by Stig 'Stikkan' Anderson, the publisher, lyricist and manager of Abba.
The first Polar Music Prize laureate was Sir Paul McCartney.
The aim of the award is to "break down musical boundaries by bringing together people from all the different worlds of music.'
In a career spanning seven decades, pioneer Berry has released a string of classic songs such as Roll Over Beethoven and Johnny B Goode.
According to the award committee: "In the course of three minutes he conjures up an image of the everyday life and dreams of a teenager, often with the focus on cars. Chuck Berry, born in 1926, was the first to drive up onto the highway and announce that we are born to run."
Acclaimed opera, theatre and festival director Sellars is known for his re-interpretations of classic works.
Sellars is working with the English National Opera later this year for the world stage premiere of John Adams's latest work, The Gospel According to the Other Mary.
He is, said the award organisers, "a living definition of what the Polar Music Prize is all about: highlighting the music and presenting it in a new context".
Previous laureates include Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, BB. King, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen.

article The hosts were 2-0 up after just 17 minutes thanks to goals from Julien de Sart and Darren Bent.
Kadeem Harris scored either side of half-time to bring the visitors level, and Craig Noone put them ahead with a fine curling effort.
Bent's header made it 3-3 but Ralls' injury-time penalty won it for Cardiff.
Victory lifts Neil Warnock's side up to 12th in the Championship table, just one place and five points behind Derby, who fall to 11th and are now eight points adrift of the top six.
Steve McClaren's men had recovered from 3-0 down to draw 3-3 at home to Bristol City on Saturday, but on this occasion it was the Rams who were on the receiving end of a dramatic turnaround.
Derby looked in total control when De Sart struck on the rebound and Bent converted from Tom Ince's pass to put the home side 2-0 up.
But four minutes before the interval, Harris gave Cardiff hope when his deflected strike looped over Scott Carson in the home goal.
Harris then scored less than two minutes after the restart as he pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.
Cardiff led for the first time when Noone skilfully found the top corner from the edge of the box, but Bent appeared to have salvaged a point for Derby when he rose higher than Sean Morrison to head in.
However, there was a final twist in added time as Bluebirds substitute Rhys Healey was tripped by Alex Pearce, allowing Ralls to calmly stroke his penalty into the bottom corner.
Derby County manager Steve McClaren:
"You score three goals at home and you expect to win but we haven't done that in the last two games. Why? Because we conceded seven goals.
"We've gone from a team who were hard to beat and defended very, very well to conceding seven in two games and you don't collect points doing that.
"This is the first defeat at home since September so let's not panic and over-react and say the wheels have come off, but we have to work hard on the training field."
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock:
"That's what you call old-fashioned football, end-to-end stuff and that's why I love the game. It was great to be involved in one like that, especially coming out on the right side.
"It gives me a lot of pride when I see us come to a place like this and stand up and be counted, and that's why I love the Championship more than any other league because you get genuine lads in this level.
"The goal before half-time helped us enormously. We talked about not thinking about drawing the game but trying to win it. I think we can go anywhere and give people a good game now. The biggest problem we've got is ourselves."

article The bronze sculpture, named Earthly Messenger, will be unveiled later this year in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
It will be installed under the arches in Market Square, referenced by Bowie in the song Five Years.
The work features a likeness of Bowie in 2002 looking down at Ziggy, alongside of some of his other looks.
LIVE: Updates on this story and other Buckinghamshire news
Funds for the statue, designed by sculptor Andrew Sinclair, have been raised through a Â£100,000 crowdfunding appeal, plus grants.
When completed, speakers mounted above the life size artwork will play one of 2,000 tracks every hour.
Some changes are expected to the design before the finished product is officially unveiled in March.
Bowie unveiled two albums and his Stardust persona during gigs at the Friars venue in the early 1970s.
He played a gig there in September 1971 where he gave the town the world debut of his album Hunky Dory.
Four months later he played the venue again where the majority of the set was made up of songs which featured on the Ziggy Stardust album.

Honduran special police force spokeman Anibal Baca, said they had been tipped off by Greece about the men's imminent arrival.
Greek diplomats in Honduras say none of the five speak Greek.
They were held at the international airport in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa.
According to Honduran police, they were planning to travel to the northern city of San Pedro Sula.
From there, they intended to cross into Guatemala and then Mexico before reaching the US border, some 2,000km (1,2000 miles) away.
"The passports were stolen in Athens," said Mr Baca from the Police Investigations Division (DPI).
"Those are not their real names. We are still trying to establish their identities," he told La Prensa newspaper.
The names on the passports are: Charalampos Kyrimopoulos, Alexandros Tzempelikos, Vasileios Bouzas, Konstantinos Marinakis and Anastasios Bellios.
Interpol will assist Honduran police with the investigation.

article Simon Kirby will take up the role of chief operating officer, reporting to chief executive Warren East.
Mr Kirby has earned a reported Â£750,000 salary at HS2, which will link London with the Midlands and northern England.
He said it had been a "huge honour" to work on the project, which critics say threatens swathes of countryside.
HS2 Ltd said it would miss Mr Kirby's "experience and leadership", while Rolls-Royce boss Mr East said the appointment would "strengthen management capability ahead of a period of significant expansion".
But Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin accused Mr Kirby of "getting out before the true scale of the mess he has presided over is realised".
"The departure of Simon Kirby will be a serious blow to those who champion HS2, though many of us are at a complete loss to see just exactly what it is he has done to justify his three-quarter of a million pay packet."
The first part of the HS2 project will link London and the West Midlands, carrying 400m-long (1,300ft) trains with up to 1,100 seats per train.
They will operate at speeds of up to 250mph - and would travel up to 14 times per hour in each direction.
This will be followed by a V-shaped second phase taking services from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds.
Intermediate stations in the East Midlands and South Yorkshire are also planned.

article There will be extra officers in the centre of Tenby at weekends, and on the trains coming into the town.
Arriva Trains Wales will also deploy extra security guards.
The idea of Operation Lion is to try to stop some anti-social behaviour before it even reaches Tenby.
It is in its fifth year, but has been getting bigger every time.
The town centre has been a "controlled drinking zone", where drinking on the streets is banned, since 2014.
Insp Aled Davies, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said: "The population of Tenby is normally around 5,000 to 6,000, but in the summer that can go to 60,000.
"Ninety-nine per cent of people who come to Tenby want to come down and enjoy the town as holidaymakers and as visitors, and all we ask is that people who come down here respect the town.

article They estimate Scottish farms will produce 3.3 million tonnes of cereals - including two million tonnes of barley and one million tonnes of wheat.
The rise in production was attributed to an expected 5% improvement in overall yields.
This is despite a 4% decrease in the total area of land sown.
The figures released are provisional estimates.
Oats have seen the largest estimated rise in production, increasing by about 17% to 180,000 tonnes.
Just over a million tonnes of wheat are expected, up from 990,000 tonnes last year, while winter barley production is expected to rise from 410,000 to 430,000 tonnes.
Oilseed rape crops have seen a small production rise from 148,000 to 151,000 tonnes.
Spring barley is the only major cereal crop to see reduced production this year, with wheat replacing barley in some areas.
Production is expected to fall by about 100,000 tonnes to 1.57 million tonnes.
Despite high production volumes overall, industry exports raised concerns over grain quality at the Scottish government's annual crop report meeting.
It heard that the 2015 harvest was late to start and, once underway, was halted several times by poor weather conditions.
This was found to have restricted crop development, which contributed to reduced grain quality in some cases.
Rural Affair Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "This year's cereal harvest estimates are testament to the professionalism and hard work of Scotland's farmers.
"They are a great achievement, especially considering the poor growing conditions we have had in Scotland, with some parts of the country experiencing the wettest summer in a century.
"I am pleased to see such high yields being reported this year, undoubtedly helped by the recent spell of more settled weather conditions.
"However, I am aware that producers in some areas, such as Shetland, have yet to harvest their crops, and the Scottish government, NFUS and other stakeholders continue to closely monitor the situation through our wet weather working group."
Final harvest estimates will be announced by Scotland's chief statistician in December.

article "Cedric" is only a basic prototype but could be developed into a machine which is smaller, faster and more efficient than today's silicon models.
Nanotubes have long been touted as the heir to silicon's throne, but building a working computer has proven awkward.
The breakthrough by Stanford University engineers is published in Nature.
Cedric is the most complex carbon-based electronic system yet realised.
So is it fast? Not at all. It might have been in 1955.
The computer operates on just one bit of information, and can only count to 32.
"In human terms, Cedric can count on his hands and sort the alphabet. But he is, in the full sense of the word, a computer," says co-author Max Shulaker.
"There is no limit to the tasks it can perform, given enough memory".
In computing parlance, Cedric is "Turing complete". In principle, it could be used to solve any computational problem.
It runs a basic operating system which allows it to swap back and forth between two tasks - for instance, counting and sorting numbers.
And unlike previous carbon-based computers, Cedric gets the answer right every time.
"People have been talking about a new era of carbon nanotube electronics, but there have been few demonstrations. Here is the proof," said Prof Subhasish Mitra, lead author on the study.
The Stanford team hope their achievement will galvanise efforts to find a commercial successor to silicon chips, which could soon encounter their physical limits.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are hollow cylinders composed of a single sheet of carbon atoms.
They have exceptional properties which make them ideal as a semiconductor material for building transistors, the on-off switches at the heart of electronics.
For starters, CNTs are so thin - thousands could fit side-by-side in a human hair - that it takes very little energy to switch them off.
"Think of it as stepping on a garden hose. The thinner the pipe, the easier it is to shut off the flow," said HS Philip Wong, co-author on the study.
But while single-nanotube transistors have been around for 15 years, no-one had ever put the jigsaw pieces together to make a useful computing device.
So how did the Stanford team succeed where others failed? By overcoming two common bugbears which have bedevilled carbon computing.
First, CNTs do not grow in neat, parallel lines. "When you try and line them up on a wafer, you get a bowl of noodles," says Mitra.
The Stanford team built chips with CNTs which are 99.5% aligned - and designed a clever algorithm to bypass the remaining 0.5% which are askew.
They also eliminated a second type of imperfection - "metallic" CNTs - a small fraction of which always conduct electricity, instead of acting like semiconductors that can be switched off.
To expunge these rogue elements, the team switched off all the "good" CNTs, then pumped the remaining "bad" ones full of electricity - until they vaporised. The result is a functioning circuit.
The Stanford team call their two-pronged technique "imperfection-immune design". Its greatest trick? You don't even have to know where the imperfections lie - you just "zap" the whole thing.
"These are initial necessary steps in taking carbon nanotubes from the chemistry lab to a real environment," said Supratik Guha, director of physical sciences for IBM's Thomas J Watson Research Center.
But hang on - what if, say, Intel, or another chip company, called up and said "I want a billion of these". Could Cedric be scaled up and factory-produced?
In principle, yes: "There is no roadblock", says Franz Kreupl, of the Technical University of Munich in Germany.
"If research efforts are focused towards a scaled-up (64-bit) and scaled-down (20-nanometre transistor) version of this computer, we might soon be able to type on one."
Shrinking the transistors is the next challenge for the Stanford team. At a width of eight microns (8,000 nanometres) they are much fatter than today's most advanced silicon chips.
But while it may take a few years to achieve this gold standard, it is now only a matter of time - there is no technological barrier, says Shulaker.
"In terms of size, IBM has already demonstrated a nine-nanometre CNT transistor.
"And as for manufacturing, our design is compatible with current industry processes. We used the same tools as Intel, Samsung or whoever.
"So the billions of dollars invested into silicon has not been wasted, and can be applied for CNTs."
For 40 years we have been predicting the end of silicon. Perhaps that end is now in sight.

British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland will help out with pre-season coaching on his return to Wales.
WRU head of rugby Geraint John is helping with player recruitment, targeting "Welsh exiles and young Welsh talent".
Dragons, Scarlets, Ospreys and Blues were formed along with Celtic Warriors as Welsh rugby's top echelon was reduced to five teams in 2003.
A year later the Warriors, made up of a combined Bridgend-Pontypridd team, folded.
Ospreys dropped Neath-Swansea from their title in 2005 and Scarlets did likewise when Llanelli was removed from their moniker in 2008.
The WRU takeover, including the Rodney Parade ground, takes effect on 1 July, 2017.
But the name change takes immediate effect and with it comes a set of targets laid down by the governing body's chief executive Martyn Phillips and his Dragons counterpart Stuart Davies.
In year one those targets include:
Beyond that, the targets include:
A statement read: "The overriding message within the detailed plans is that rugby should thrive at all levels in the Dragons region, with the amateur and professional game aligned at every turn with men's, women's, boys' and girls' rugby given equal status in Gwent."

article The sentence "over-emphasised" the crimes, and Hewitt's age and health should be considered, his lawyer said.
The prosecution said it was opposed to the sentence being reduced.
The 76-year-old, who is out on bail, was convicted last year of raping and sexually assaulting girls he coached in South Africa the 1980s and 1990s.
The trial judge gave him permission to challenge his sentence, but not conviction, in the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Last month, the Australian-born Hewitt was expelled from the International Tennis Hall of Fame because of his conviction.
"The crux of the matter is that age is supposed to be taken into account," his lawyer Johann Engelbrecht told a panel of three judges who are hearing the appeal.
"Our submission is that the sentence over-emphasises the crime and the retribution," he added.
'No remorse'
Mr Engelbrecht also argued that Hewitt had not committed one of the "worst offences", and was not a danger to society, South Africa's privately owned Times Live news site reports.
The judges questioned the lawyer's views, with one remarking that the trial judge could have sentenced Hewitt to life in prison for raping a minor, it reports.
Prosecutor Carina Coetzee said Hewitt did not deserve a lower sentence because he had failed to show remorse, and had breached the trust of children.
Hewitt was found guilty in March last year of raping two girls and of sexually assaulting a third.
The trial judge said at the time that the striking similarities between the three victims' testimonies showed that his conduct was calculated.
The appeal court reserved judgement. It has the power to maintain the six-year sentence, reduce it, or increase it.
Hewitt played initially for Australia, later moving to South Africa and taking citizenship there.
He was a member of the South African team which won the Davis Cup by default in 1974.
India, their opponents, refused to travel to South Africa for the final as a protest over the government's apartheid policies.

article Corramore Construction Ltd was fined Â£750 for causing pollution on the Altagoan River near Draperstown.
Inspectors found silage effluent being piped into the river from a site where an anaerobic digestion plant was being built.
The company pleaded guilty to the offence from March 2016.
Officers went to the Gortnaskey Road near Draperstown after a pollution report.
They found fungal growth in the river and recorded a strong agricultural odour from the water.
A pipe was discovered that was discharging a dark coloured liquid to the river.
Further examination found two other pipes also discharging effluent.
It had gathered at a construction site where the anaerobic digester plant was being built.
Samples of discharge were collected from three different points.
All were found to contain poisonous, noxious or polluting matter that was potentially harmful to fish.
Anaerobic digesters use organic material like slurry or silage, which are broken down in the sealed units to produce a biogas.
It can be burned to generate heat and power.

article It has also indicated that EU payments to farmers will be upheld until 2020.
The Treasury statement comes after Northern Ireland's finance minister raised concerns that Stormont was not being consulted about future EU funds.
Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said the money was to be handed out between now and 2020.
He told an audience in Belfast that he did not believe the Treasury would underwrite half of peace and cross-border funding.
But the Treasury has now said it will stand by structural and investment fund projects signed before November.
Chancellor Philip Hammond also said universities bidding competitively for EU projects would still have their payments underwritten even if those projects continue after the UK leaves the EU.
Responding to Mr Hammond's announcement, Mr Ó Muilleoir said it did not go far enough.
"While the decision will help some applicants for EU funds, it will leave a question mark over scores of other vital projects and means potentially up to £300m of future funding is in peril," he said.
He added that he had spoken to Mr Hammond to ask that Northern Ireland "would not lose a penny of EU related funding streams".
Funding from the EU has helped to improve transport links between Belfast and Dublin and build Londonderry's Peace Bridge.
EU money has also been a major source of funding for peace-building and the voluntary sector in Northern Ireland.
Chancellor Philip Hammond said: "We recognise that many organisations across the UK, which are in receipt of EU funding, or expect to start receiving funding, want reassurance about the flow of funding they will receive.
"That's why I am confirming that structural and investment funds projects signed before the autumn statement will be guaranteed by the Treasury after we leave [the EU].
"The government will also match the current level of agricultural funding until 2020, providing certainty to our agricultural community, who play a vital role in our country."
While the UK voted to leave the European Union by 52% to 48%, 56% of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain.

Once the new service is running, passengers can expect to travel at an average of about 310mph.

article She will be joined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at the ceremony on the Queensferry Crossing on 4 September.
The £1.35bn bridge will open to traffic on 30 August, but it will close on 2 and 3 September to allow pedestrians to cross.
The opening ceremony will take place exactly 53 years after the Queen opened the Forth Road Bridge.
The new crossing will replace the existing road bridge as the main route between Edinburgh and Fife.
On the day of the Queen's visit activities will take place on both sides of the 1.7 mile bridge.
They will include a welcome address by the first minister and a blessing by the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
Scotland's Makar, Jackie Kay, will read a poem specially commissioned for the occasion and there will be live music performances.
Ms Sturgeon said: "It is very fitting that the Queensferry Crossing will be officially opened by The Queen, exactly 53 years to the day from when she opened the Forth Road Bridge.
"Importantly, this celebratory event will recognise the thousands of people who have been involved in the construction of the new bridge.
"The Queensferry Crossing is a symbol of a confident, forward-looking Scotland and - as well as providing a vital transport connection for many years to come - it is a truly iconic structure and a feat of modern engineering."
Source: Scottish government
The new bridge will be closed to traffic on 2 and 3 September to allow 50,000 members of the public walk across the bridge as part of the Queensferry Crossing Experience.
Around 250,000 applied for a ballot to take part in the one-off event.
A "community day" on 5 September will give another 10,000 people from local schools and community groups an opportunity to walk across the bridge before it re-opens to traffic, with no pedestrian access, on 6 September.
Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said "Scotland will celebrate a moment in history" when the Queen opens the bridge.
"At this unique moment, the country will become the world's first destination to have three bridges spanning three centuries in one stunning location," he said.
"It is a time to not only celebrate Scotland as a nation of pioneering innovation, design and engineering, but also give thanks all those who have worked tirelessly to create this unique new structure.
"People are fascinated worldwide by bridges, whether it's for their beauty, grandeur or breath-taking engineering prowess. The addition of the Queensferry Crossing consolidates the Forth Bridges as global icons of Scotland and we look forward to showcasing all three awe-inspiring structures to the world for many years to come."

Congress in Yucatan on the other hand banned same-sex marriage in 2009.
Seven out of ten authorities in Colima approved the constitutional change, which had been passed by the state's congress earlier this month.
Only two Congressmen voted against the change, arguing the state should legalise gay marriages rather than restricting same-sex couples to civil unions.
News of the change in the law in Colima came on the same day as Pope Francis told reporters that gay people should not be marginalised but integrated into society.
Speaking to reporters on a flight back from Brazil, the Pope reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but homosexual orientation was not.
Gay marriage was legalised in Uruguay earlier this year, and in Argentina in 2010.
In Brazil, the Supreme Court in May voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage.
However, full legalisation of gay marriage in Brazil still depends on the passage of a law in Congress.

article He is the first prime minister to make details of his financial affairs public in this way, prompting calls for other politicians to follow suit.
But what has he had to say about tax avoidance - which is legal - and tax evasion - which is illegal - in recent years?
April 2012: Sources close to the prime minister said Mr Cameron was "relaxed about the idea of the tax returns of senior cabinet ministers being published - but wants the opportunity to explore how this might work".
January 2015: "I am very relaxed about publishing these things. There's no secrets about my status. I am paid very handsomely as your prime minister and that's my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street and I rent that out and I get income from that. I don't have other sources of income. There will be no surprises in terms of my tax affairs."
April 2016: "I will be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but the years gone past because I want to be completely open and transparent about these things. I will be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that and I think it is the right thing to do."
June 2012: Responding to media coverage of Jimmy Carr's tax arrangements amid claims the comedian was among a number of high-profile figures using legal but aggressive tax avoidance vehicles, Mr Cameron said:
"Frankly some of these schemes where people are parking huge amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimise their tax rates is not morally acceptable.
"Some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong. People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets.
"He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."
June 2013: Announcing that the US, UK and other G8 members had agreed to a series of tax transparency agreements following a summit in Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron said:
"Let me commend Britain's NGOs and charities for the campaigning work they have done for years on campaigning against tax secrecy, campaigning for openness, campaigning for transparency in extractive industries.
"This is a cause I have long espoused and have long believed in.
"The declaration says that tax authorities across the world automatically share information, that companies should know who owns them, tax collectors and law enforcers should be able to get this information easily.
"These are really strong commitments that have never been written down in this sort of way and then signed. This is words on a page that the G8 is going to be judged on year after year after year."
June 2013: Announcing that the UK had reached an agreement with the UK's Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies to sign up to a tax evasion clampdown, Mr Cameron said:
"It is important we are getting our house in order. It is a very positive step forward and it means that Britain's voice in the G8, and campaigning on this issue around the world for proper taxes, proper companies, proper laws... will be stronger."
June 2013: Speaking at an event highlighting the damage that tax evasion does to global trade and developing countries, Mr Cameron said:
"The extraordinary thing about this tax, transparency and trade agenda is that it's not just the right thing for us to do morally it's right for our economies too.
"Because when some businesses don't pay their taxes, it corrodes public trust. When some companies don't play by the rules, that drives more regulation and makes it harder for other businesses to turn a profit...
"It means getting companies to report to tax authorities where they earn their profits and where they pay their tax. It also means transparency about who owns which companies and who benefits from it - so called beneficial ownership.
"Why? Because some people use complicated and fake structures to hide their profits and avoid taxes."

article Lee Connors, 30, pointed a handgun at Grant MacBeth and tried to discharge the weapon in Barn Park, Edinburgh, on 25 October 2014.
Connors had denied attempting to murder Mr MacBeth.
He lodged a special defence of alibi claiming he had been at his mother's home and then a girlfriend's house.
Connors was found guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh.
When police recovered the revolver they found that there were three bullets in the six chambers of the gun.
Kimberley Dow, 23, who also had the gun pointed at her by Connors, told the court: "He pulled the trigger three times at Grant."
Ms Dow said: "I heard the clicks. Click, click, click. I can still hear the clicking in my head today."
He was also found guilty of assaulting Ms Dow by pointing the gun at her.
Connors, a prisoner, was also convicted of a breach of the peace and firearms offences, including illegal possession of the gun and ammunition.
Judge Lord Uist told Connors: "You have been convicted by the jury of very grave crimes. It is likely you will receive a very long prison sentence for these crimes."
The judge said because Connors had not previously been jailed he was required to get a background report on him before sentencing.
Ms Dow said that, before the murder bid, Connors had contacted her and said he needed help and could not ask anyone else. She said he sounded "really distressed" and agreed to meet him.
She said: "I was going to put him up. I was scared for his safety the way he was acting.
"I felt so bad because he said there was people after him."
They went to her flat in Barn Park where she saw the gun for the first time. "He was sitting on the bath unloading the gun," she said.
"Lee had it in his hand. I was like 'You can't have it in here.' I saw the whole gun when he took it out the bag."
Ms Dow said Connors left but returned the next day.
Mr MacBeth had come to her home, which Connors was unhappy about.
Connors then pointed the gun at both of them.
Connors described Ms Dow as "poisonous". He said: "It's not just me. It seems to be anyone she gets into a relationship with."
Sentence was deferred on Connors, who remains in custody, until next month.
Det Insp John Kavanagh, of Police Scotland, said: "Lee Andrew Connors was responsible for causing considerable fear and alarm to his victims when he pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.
"His conviction should serve as a reminder to others that Police Scotland will not tolerate gun crime."

article Among the more recognisable names are Lucie Jones and Danyl Johnson, who both featured in the 2009 series, which was eventually won by Joe McElderry.
Jones's song has the best pedigree: Never Give Up On You is written by 2013 Eurovision winner, Emmelie de Forest.
TV talent has good form at Eurovision, with two previous winners graduating from singing contests like X Factor.
Swedish singer Loreen, who won the competition in 2012, was previously a runner-up on Swedish Idol, where she performed under the name Loren Talhaoui.
More recently, Mans Zelmerlow triumphed at the 2015 contest  - having earned his stripes on Swedish Idol and Let's Dance, which is his home country's version of Strictly.
This year's UK's entry will be selected on Friday, 27 January, in a live BBC Two show hosted by Mel Giedroyc.
A combination of viewer and jury votes will decide the winning song - with Bruno Tonioli and Sophie Ellis-Bextor forming part of the eight-person jury.
Danyl Johnson - Light Up the World
Former schoolteacher Danyl Johnson was, at one point, the bookies' favourite to win X Factor 2009. He eventually came fourth - losing out to Joe McElderry and runner-up Olly Murs - and earned brief notoriety after being (sort-of) outed by Danni Minogue.
The singer, who currently works as an ambassador for  the People's Postcode Lottery, enters Eurovision with a empowering dance track about "shining a light in the darkness" - harking back to Katrina and the Waves' Eurovision-winning song in 1997.
It aims for anthemic but ends up sounding anaemic.
Key lyric: "We couldn't see, yeah, standing in the dark."
Holly Brewer - I Wish I Loved You More
Holly has previously sung at the wedding of Mark Wright (The Only Way is Essex) and Michelle Keegan (Coronation Street) - and received four "yeses" from the X Factor judges in 2015.
However, producers axed her from the programme by phone in a pre-bootcamp contestant cull - Cowell and co presumably underestimated the cost of accommodation in Wembley.
Never fear, for now Holly is returning with a power ballad co-written by Courtney Harrell, a former contestant on The Voice US. A decent effort which sounds like it could have been found on Kelly Clarkson's studio floor.
Key lyric: "You're the sunlight the the preacher talks about. Ooh-ooh, Amen."
Lucie Jones - Never Give Up on You
Lucie Jones will be remembered by the die-hard X Factor enthusiasts for coming eighth in the 2009 series - finishing behind fellow Eurovision hopeful Danyl Johnson and, er, Jedward.
While she might have crashed out of the live finals fairly early, she should be more confident of winning the UK Eurovision race - as her song is co-written by Emmelie de Forest - the Danish singer-songwriter who won the song contest in 2013.
Her vocals have improved remarkably since 2009, but the song is untroubled by percussion and ends up a slightly dreary piano ballad (not necessarily an obstacle to Eurovision victory).
Key lyric: "Together we'll dance through this storm."
Nate Simpson - What Are We Made Of?
"You opened your mouth and Jesus came out," said Nicole Scherzinger when Slough-born Nate Simpson auditioned for the X Factor last year.
That didn't stop her kicking him out at the judges's houses round, though. Maybe if he'd kept Jesus in there for a little longer...
The 23-year-old is hoping to go to Eurovision with the piano ballad What Are We Made Of?. It has a key change before the first chorus, which gives you an indication of what you're in for.
Key lyric: "We're breathing underwater and the struggle makes us stronger."
Olivia Garcia - Freedom Hearts
Canadian singer Laurell Barker has been busy on the songwriting front this year because, as well as penning Holly's song, she has writing credits on Olivia Garcia's.
Olivia is fresh from the most recent series of X Factor. She made it as far as judges houses, but Simon Cowell sadly didn't take her through to the live shows.
She's now joined the Eurovision race with a propulsive ballad that could lend itself to a dramatic staging (we're thinking acrobats and a tug of war). Garcia's vocal acrobatics, meanwhile, do a good job of showing Cowell what he missed.
Key lyric: "Shiny hair and shoes, how about me and you?"
Salena Mastroianni - I Don't Wanna Fight
A distant relative of the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni (La Dolce Vita; Divorce, Italian Style) Salena has a degree in fashion, but ditched the runway to pursue a career in music.
After working as a wedding singer for four years, she auditioned for X Factor in 2012 but failed to progress beyond the initial stages.
Instantly catchy, her song I Don't Wanna Fight is the most contemporary of this year's Eurovision entries, with a trance-house beat that's proved successful for other countries in recent years.
Although the lyrics appear to carry an anti-war sentiment, Mastroianni says the song is about a relationship.
Key lyric: "Why can't we put our weapons down?"

article Buildings at Newcastle upon Tyne and University College London Hospitals NHS trusts have been found to have combustible cladding.
They will now have to take action and continue with 24-hour fire warden patrols in the meantime.
It brings the total of failed sites to five - none of the buildings has patients staying overnight.
One is an office building, while the others see and treat patients during the day.
In all the cases - except one - the cladding is being removed. The exception is UCLH, where a building at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery has failed tests. Other options are being explored because of the size of the building involved.
Thirty-eight of the highest risk sites have now been checked. NHS bosses said the review of sites would now be expanded to other hospitals, with another six added to the high-priority list.
A spokesman for NHS Improvement, the regulator in charge of carrying out the checks, said: "Patient safety continues to be our absolute priority, and we'll make sure the NHS is supported to carry out the urgent fire safety checks required."
The urgent checks were ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt following the Grenfell Tower fire.
In Scotland, health boards have confirmed combustible cladding has not been used on any buildings.

article The price of Brent crude rose 4.5% to $54.19 a barrel, its highest level this year, after soaring 8.8% on Wednesday.
The deal, Opec's first output cut for eight years, is designed to reverse a slump in global oil prices and will see the group reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day from January.
But analysts have raised doubts about its chances of succeeding.
"Compliance is key and it's worth noting that Opec members don't have the best record on that front," said Neil Wilson of ETX Capital.
The price of US crude has also risen, trading 4.3% higher at $51.54 a barrel after jumping 9% on Wednesday.
"Opec has delivered an agreement," said Jason Gammel of US investment bank Jefferies. "For the time being, oil prices have received a huge support."
The output cut follows several years of depressed oil prices due to a supply glut on the market, which has seen prices more than halve since 2014.
The agreement rests heavily on Saudi Arabia - the world's biggest oil producer - which has agreed to slash about 4.5% of its output, or 500,000 barrels per day.
But non-Opec countries are also party to the deal and will be expected to reduce production by a further 600,000 barrels a day.
So far Russia has pledged to cut 300,000 barrels from its output of more than 10 million barrels a day, but it is unclear who else will also scale back.
Despite the rises, analysts noted that prices had only returned to levels seen in September and October - when plans for a cut were first announced - and raised doubts about the deal.
Mr Wilson said oil-producing countries that were not party to the deal, such as the US, were likely to increase production as prices rose, offsetting efforts to curb oversupply.
"Russia says it will cut 300,000 barrels per day... but we don't know where the other 300,000 barrels a day from other non-Opec members is going to come from," he added.
"Opec has suggested the deal is contingent on getting this cut... we don't yet know if [the deal] could unravel if this doesn't happen."
Opec said it would hold talks with non-Opec producers on 9 December, and hold another meeting in May 2017 to monitor the deal's progress.

article Approval from the European Commission was the last big regulatory hurdle Dell needed to overcome to close the deal.
Dell hopes the purchase of EMC will allow it better compete with IBM, Cisco Systems, and Hewlett-Packard in cloud computing and cyber security.
The EC said the combined company would still face strong market competition.
EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said: "I am pleased that we have been able to approve Dell's multibillion dollar takeover of EMC within a short space of time while making sure that there would be no adverse effects on customers."
The deal won approval from US regulators earlier this month.
The two companies are still waiting regulatory approval in smaller markets.
EMC shareholders also need to approve the deal, but a spokesperson for Dell said that European approval was "a strong sign the deal was running on time and under the original terms".
The transaction is expected to close before Dell's third quarter ends in July.
The purchase of EMC is part of a series of changes founder Michael Dell and his partners, Silver Lake, have made since taking the company private in 2013.
Mr Dell founded the company in 1984.
He has a combined Dell/EMC would create a "powerhouse" in the $2 trillion IT sector.

English Heritage wanted to close the road to "restore the dignity" of the World Heritage Site.

article The Ferguson Brown, worth up to £20,000, is one of 100 vintage tractors for sale in Dromore, County Tyrone on Saturday.
The collection owner spent 40 years lovingly restoring the vehicles but has now decided to sell them off.
And the sale has attracted interest from the US and Germany.
David Graham of Euro Auctions said there has been "huge interest" in the sale.
He said he believed it was due in part to people's nostalgic connection to the land.
David Marshall from Omagh is hoping to buy the Ferguson Brown for a customer in Cumbria.
But he was not prepared to say what he would be prepared to pay for the "iconic little lady".
"It'll definitely go for more than the £226 it was worth when it was new," he said.
The Ferguson Brown revolutionised farming as it was the first tractor which allowed implements like ploughs to be connected directly to the vehicle and raised and lowered using a gear system.
Also in the sale are 15 racing red Porsche tractors - with a top speed of 20mph.
They were built under franchise in the Republic of Ireland in the post war years.
They are expected to make between £10-20,000 depending on the model.

article Businesses have placed banners on verges along the A591 close to the Staveley junction near Kendal, in Cumbria, in a bid to attract trade.
Firms said they had seen a dip in trade since  Storm Desmond in December.
The Lake District National Park Authority has suggested a compromise of a single shared sign.
Michael Tullis, joint-owner of Inglefield Plants, said: "Everybody is struggling. Before I put my sings out our trade was 50% of normal. Since then it's improved, but it's not good.
"I know it is against the law to put these things up, but we've got to try to survive until this is over. I thought when I put them up they would see reason under the circumstances."
South Lakeland MP Tim Farron said businesses in Staveley had faced difficulties since the loss of a bridge which was damaged by the storms.
He has written to the park authority calling for a "common sense approach" and for the village to be treated as a "special case".
The park authority has written to traders informing them the signs contravene national planning regulations, which say adverts must be on the premises to which they relate.
Dave McGowan, from the authority, said: "We have asked a small number of businesses to play by the rules to reduce the clutter at the junction.
"We are really sympathetic to the plight of businesses in the village - there are over 60. You can imagine if all of them had signs what a situation we would have."
He added Cumbria County Council had indicated it would be willing to provide "a single sign or a couple of signs so everybody can benefit from the publicity".
The authority, which can allow such a banner "at its discretion", will meet next week with the parish and county councils to discuss the matter.

article The decision was made after discussions of the benefits a new stadium and leisure complex would bring.
Grimsby Town FC's preferred site is 22.7 hectares of council land between Peaks Parkway and Weelsby Avenue.
The authority said more than three potential sites were being considered but declined to disclose the locations.
It said it would examine the whole of North East Lincolnshire and would publish its findings in a report, which is expected to be released later this summer.
Under council plans, the club could move to the new stadium.
Leader of North East Lincolnshire Council Ray Oxby said: "It's clear that a thriving local football club makes sense - it's good for business, creates a lasting legacy and provides a catalyst to boost to the borough's general wellbeing.
"I'm pleased that we can now take the next step and take an objective look at the most appropriate sites."
In 2012, the authority agreed to carry out an independent survey of land for the development.
A planning application is yet to be submitted.

article Kate Chisholm, of Skerne Park Academy, Darlington, made the appeal after she noticed more and more adults wearing pyjamas at the school gates as well as at meetings and assemblies.
She said her aim was to help set a good example for pupils.
Parent Phil Naylor said wearing nightwear to school was "disgraceful".
Ms Chisholm said the final straw came when parents wore pyjamas to the Christmas show and to recent parents' evenings.
"It just got to the point when I thought 'enough's enough'," she said.
"I'm not trying to tell people what to do with their lives, but I just think having a really good role model first thing in the morning, getting yourself up, getting yourself dressed, ready for business, out to school is a really good example to set.
"I'm afraid wearing pyjamas, going to school, maybe doesn't reinforce that somehow."
In her letter, Ms Chisholm wrote: "If we're to raise standards it's not too much to ask parents to have a wash and get dressed.
"I have had loads of support from the community and people saying it's about time something was done. I have had far more positive responses than negative," she said.
"If I get the parents on board then we often get the children too and in order to get the best chances for the children we have to raise the bar with the parents."
School parent Mr Naylor said Ms Chisholm had his support: "It's disgraceful, we should be guiding our children not giving them bad habits."

article Mr Bell made allegations in a interview with Stephen Nolan on Thursday.
Mr Bell said a whistleblower civil servant told him references to Arlene Foster were removed from a document about the ending of the scheme.
Mr Hamilton said the allegations were serious and warranted investigation.
On Monday, he released another document to the NI Assembly library.
"There are are many technical details here involving the machinery of government," he said.
"As detailed, this documentation involves the drafting and redrafting of a Department for the Economy (DETI) submission regarding RHI closure in 2016.
"There was no 'cleansing' of records, as both drafts are recorded and retained."
"The re-drafting was undertaken by Mr Bell's special adviser. It deleted a specific reference to OFMDFM  being involved in discussions in early 2016 on the closure of RHI.
"This was not done on behalf of or to the benefit of First Minister Foster.
"As the documentation shows, this OFMDFM involvement  helped secure the closure of RHI in February 2016 - earlier than the date originally signed off on by Minister Bell".
"To suggest this was a cover-up is to ignore the facts.
"The involvement of the first minister and deputy first minster to bring forward RHI closure was in the public interest and the original draft made this involvement explicit," he added.

article Woods, 41, winner of 14 majors, was found "asleep at the wheel" with the engine running when he was arrested on Monday in Florida.
Why so nasty? Why don't you try to do the opposite and help him now in the way he inspired us?
The American said it was because of a reaction to medication.
Kaymer said: "Stop being so nasty. Try to help. We all want to see him happier and one day see him play golf again."
Palm Beach County police released video of Woods' arrest and subsequently of his breathalyser test inside the Sheriff's Office, which shows the former number one handcuffed and appearing to sit slumped on a chair.
He was initially charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI).
"Obviously a lot of people know what happened to Tiger Woods the last few days,'' Kaymer said in a video on his Twitter account, seemingly in reaction to disparaging remarks on social media.
"There's so many comments, so many opinions. They are so unfair and so disrespectful, in my opinion.
"He inspired kids, teenagers; he inspired all of us.
"I find it so nasty that people just kick him while he's already on the floor, and at the end of the day it's just using someone else for your own sadness. Yes, he's in the public eye, he's in the spotlight a lot, so of course people will talk about him.
"But why so nasty? Why don't you try to do the opposite and help him now in the way he inspired us?''
Woods has been recovering from back surgery - his fourth such operation - and is expected to be out of action until October.

article Daniel Morgan, 24, had his arm broken in three places after being attacked by Andrew Chamberlain, a court heard.
Chamberlain hit Mr Morgan with the 4ft metal pole after the neighbour left his car outside Chamberlain's home in Greenfield Terrace, Blackwood.
The 50-year-old, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent at Cardiff Crown Court, said he used the pole in self defence.
The court heard parking was a "contentious issue" on the street and residents agreed to only park outside their own homes.
When Mr Morgan parked outside Chamberlain's home, he became "abusive and threatening," the court heard.
He took the large metal pole from his garden and Mr Morgan said he blocked a blow with his arm.
He said: "It was excruciating pain as I am sure you can imagine."
Chamberlain told the jury: "When I lifted the pole up he punched out at me with his left hand.
"As I was bringing the pole down, it made contact with the side of his arm."
Mr Morgan said he was not aware of any parking restrictions.
Sentencing was adjourned for reports to be prepared and Chamberlain was released on bail but Recorder Peter Griffiths QC warned him he faces jail.

article Cars scraped their bumpers while disembarking and stranded passengers waded through water when it broke down on its first weekend in operation.
It remains suspended on the orders of the Maritime Coastguard Agency (MCA).
Mainstay Marine said it was working on an "enhanced" training programme for the crew.
More on this and other stories from across the South of England
Stewart Graves, managing director of Pembroke-based Mainstay Marine, said there had been concerns crew were struggling to operate ferry systems but a new training scheme includes a test at the end to ensure they "absorb" what was learnt.
The service was suspended on 14 May.  At a meeting of East Cowes Town Council on Thursday, local businesses claimed it had been a "unmitigated disaster".
Shop owner Angela Booth, said: "We got a wonky banger that is slower, more dangerous and completely unfit for purpose".
Mr Graves said: "I'm comfortable the slipway is at the right angle and the ramps are suitable for safe off-loading. It's all due to positioning - being placed on the slipway and lowering to the right angle.
"I feel comfortable the vessel is fit for purpose and will be a success with the enhanced crew training."
Isle of Wight Council said it was working with the manufacturer to "resolve the issues identified during the live testing".
"It was anticipated that during the first couple of weeks, that there would be some issues to be ironed out that could not be identified until the vessel was back in service and in full use," the authority said.
An MCA spokeswoman said it was "waiting on remedial action" before surveyors would reassess the service.

article It reached its peak in 2013-14, when it was far easier for jihadists to cross the 822km-long (510-mile) Turkey-Syria border, when IS propaganda on social media went largely unchallenged, and when IS was on a roll militarily, seizing ever more territory across northern Syria and north-western Iraq.
While all three of those factors have now changed to the detriment of IS, the underlying factors propelling young Britons and Europeans towards joining the group have not gone away. So what are they?
IS has been phenomenally successful in exploiting a sense of alienation and a "failure to belong" among many young European Muslims.
Many recruits have felt alienated from their families, on the one hand, and from the wider societies they live in, on the other.
Here, the internet has played a major role. Teenagers still living at home will spend large amounts of time shut away in their rooms online.
Parents often have little or no idea about who their son or daughter is communicating with, and by the time they realise they are being radicalised by someone it is often too late.
There have been many cases of concerned families reporting their suspicions to the authorities, and an ever-increasing number of cases are being referred to the UK government's Channel programme, which focuses on providing support to those identified as being vulnerable to radicalisation.
Just as serious as alienation from the family is alienation from society.
IS propaganda aims to convince potential recruits that their loyalty belongs not to their country of residence but to the IS-declared "caliphate", and that to vote in Western elections, pay Western taxes or to serve Western governments in any way is "haram" (forbidden).
Their message is that life in the West is a waste of time and that "hijra" (emigration) to "dar al-Islam" (the realm of Islam), lands under Muslim rule where Sharia prevails, is the duty of all Muslims.
For someone deeply unhappy with their life in the UK, won over by the mirage of some distant society ruled fairly according to God's laws and not man's, this can be an attractive proposition.
Key to delivering this message is IS's adept use of persuasive, charismatic figures.
Statistics show that in most cases people are persuaded to join the IS cause by their peers.
This can be an older brother who has already gone out to Syria and tells them how perfect life is out there, a classmate, or even a stranger encountered online who uses a nom de guerre like "Abu Abdullah al-Britani".
A former IS recruit I interviewed in a Jordanian prison in 2015 told me how his best friend from school went to Syria, fought for IS and persuaded him over the phone to join him.
He did, but disliked and deserted after just two weeks.
Unfortunately for him, when he returned to Jordan the authorities gave him a mandatory five-year prison sentence, hardly an incentive for others to have second thoughts.
Against the lure of seemingly "heroic" IS fighters attracting others online to their cause, European government and community leaders were initially slow to respond.
Imams and other Muslim community leaders have been appalled at seeing their co-religionists drawn away into such a violent, world-hating cult.
They have written public letters condemning IS, issued sermons at Friday prayers and reported to the police individuals showing signs of radical behaviour.
Yet in terms of charisma these religious and community leaders have little influence over young people, at least not compared to the glamour attached to some of the fighters, brandishing Kalashnikovs and bandoliers, and recruiters churning out a constant stream of slick propaganda from Raqqa and Mosul.
Researchers have concluded that one of the principal driving factors behind IS recruitment in Europe is the idea that the person is somehow serving a greater or higher cause, in this case something presented as "the nobility of jihad (holy war)".
For someone whose life in the West appeared to lack meaning, purpose or dignity this can quickly resonate. A young person connecting with a charismatic fighter skyping from Syria can therefore be persuaded to give up his life here in a matter of a few weeks.
For some brainwashed young men, the notion of being somehow "sent on an important mission", even something as self-destructive as blowing yourself up at an Iraqi checkpoint, can give them the illusion of being selected for some elite role with a grand purpose.
The slick messaging and skilful - albeit sick - use of graphics, cinematography, and extreme, voyeuristic violence has certainly increased the appeal of IS among certain people, many of them with criminal backgrounds.
The sadistic forms of execution meted out to IS's enemies, predominantly other Muslims, serve in turn to pull in more individuals with psychopathic tendencies.
Barbaric cruelties abhorrent to most people, like the enslavement and rape of children as young as 12 from among captured communities, are either ignored or explained away with various religious justifications and quotes from centuries-old texts.
In recent months, IS has toned down some of its more graphic imagery, perhaps aware that it is repellent to so many people, emphasising instead its strategic view of itself and its perception that despite the many military setbacks now being suffered, its eventual triumph is somehow inevitable.
In the UK, the government has been slow to appreciate the uphill battle it is fighting in the messaging space. It is now beginning to push back with so-called "counter-messaging".
But ultimately, until large numbers of people come back from IS territory and tell the world "Don't do it, we made a terrible mistake", IS's messaging is likely to continue to resonate with certain young men and women across Europe.

article That is the conclusion of a study on footprints found in 250 million-year-old rocks from Poland.
Writing in a Royal Society journal, a team has named the creature that made them Prorotodactylus.
The prints are small - measuring a few centimetres in length - which suggests the earliest dinosaur-like animals were about the size of domestic cats.
They would have weighed at most a kilogram or two, they walked on four legs and they were very rare animals.
Their footprints comprised only two or three per cent of  the total footprints on this site.
The footprints date to just two million years after the end-Permian mass extinction - the worst mass extinction in the history of the planet.
According to Stephen Brusatte, from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who led the research: "In geological terms this is just the blink of an eye."
He told BBC News: "We can basically say that the dinosaur lineage originated in the immediate aftermath of this extinction which is a completely new idea and a very radical re-interpretation of the early history of dinosaurs".
In the end-Permian extinction event, more than 90% of all life on Earth was wiped out due to massive volcanic eruptions, sudden global warming and the stagnation of the oceans.
Up until recently, scientists had thought that dinosaurs emerged 15 to 20 million years after the mass extinction, when the planet had become more habitable.
But the new footprints suggest that the rise of dinosaurs was intimately related to the devastating extinction event.
"Without this mass extinction there would never have been dinosaurs," said Mr Brusatte.
"There's a degree of symmetry about that because when dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, that opened space for mammals," he added.
Although the footprints are characteristic of dinosaur-like creatures, they do not provide the absolute proof that a fossilised skeleton would.
"We'd rather have a skeleton because footprints are a little open to interpretation," Professor Mike Benton, from Bristol University, told BBC News.
He believes that the discovery is important - but he says it would have been published in one of the top two scientific journals in the world if Mr Brusatte had been able to provide further evidence for his claim.
"I bet you if (he had found) a skeleton which was unequivocal it would have been a front page."
The findings are published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.

article The Taiwanese researcher found files left behind by the other intruder on a neglected Facebook server.
The former hacker was using tools to scoop up login names of Facebook's net admin staff.
Facebook said the traces were left by another security researcher also seeking loopholes in its systems.
In a blog post, security researcher Orange Tsai detailed the way he found the vulnerable server and his realisation that someone else had been there before him.
The earlier intruder had set up scripts to grab the login names and other credentials for Facebook employees. At first glance, he said it looked like a "pretty serious security incident".
Mr Tsai, who works for security firm Devcore, reported his findings to Facebook so it could harden the server and clean out the login-sniffing scripts.
He won a $10,000 (Â£7,000) bug bounty from Facebook for finding the vulnerable server. In a statement on the Hacker News site, Facebook said it was "really glad" that Mr Tsai reported his findings.
"After incident response, we determined that the activity Orange detected was in fact from another researcher who participates in our bounty program," it said.
Facebook described the discovery of the vulnerable server as a "double win" as it involved two competent researchers assessing its systems. Neither was able to get further than the server to get full access to the site's internal networks, it added.
Paul Ducklin, writing on the blog of security firm Sophos, said anyone planning to do similar work on other net firms should be more careful.
"We recommend that you don't go as far as either hacker in this case." he wrote. "Orange stretched the rules a bit; the earlier mystery hacker stretched them a lot."
Going too far might introduce new weaknesses, warned Mr Ducklin.
"You don't make security stronger by weakening it," he said.

article Nicola Sturgeon greeted them outside the House of Commons, where the SNP leader said they would make Scotland's voice heard like never before.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron has confirmed David Mundell as the new secretary of state for Scotland.
Mr Mundell is the only Conservative MP in Scotland.
He had previously served in the Scotland Office as a junior minister.
The SNP won all but three of Scotland's 59 seats in last Thursday's election, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats also only holding on to one seat each.
Labour confirmed its sole remaining Scottish MP - Ian Murray in Edinburgh South - will be the party's shadow Scottish secretary as the party's MSPs held a near three-hour long meeting held to discuss Scottish Labour's election performance.
The party's leader Jim Murphy has refused to resign but there have been calls for him to go to allow the party to have a fresh start.
Speaking outside the party's HQ after the meeting, finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the "overwhelming majority" of MSPs wanted Mr Murphy and his deputy Kezia Dugdale to "lead us forward into the future".
The SNP is due to formally appoint its Westminster group leader following a meeting of its MPs on Tuesday, with Moray MP Angus Robertson expected to continue in the post he held during the previous parliament.
The role will take on a new prominence with an appearance at Prime Minister's Questions every week after the SNP was officially given third party status in the House of Commons.
As the third largest party in Parliament, the SNP is also expected to take up a front bench on the opposition side of the Commons, which had been occupied by the Liberal Democrats before 2010.
Among the SNP ranks at the Westminster event were former leader and first minister Alex Salmond, and 20-year-old Mhairi Black, the UK's youngest MP in about 350 years.
The group was met by a huge press pack and onlookers wielding a giant Saltire flag.
Speaking to reporters, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would be the "principled opposition in this place to the Conservative government."
She added: "The SNP has worked long and hard in this election to make Scotland's voice heard. To have people in Scotland in such overwhelming numbers put their trust in us is fantastic, but also is a big responsibility.
"We are determined to make Scotland's voice heard here in Westminster, but we are also determined to be that voice for progressive politics that we promised to be during the election; to stand up to policies from a Conservative government that will damage Scotland; and to make common cause with others of like mind from across the UK."
Ms Sturgeon, who had a brief telephone conversation with the prime minister last Friday, said she hoped to have "more detailed conversations" with Mr Cameron in the near future.
She said: "His starting point seemed to be to implement the Smith Commission proposals. I don't think that goes far enough and I think that has to be looked at again.
"David Cameron cannot simply operate as if nothing has changed in Scotland - everything has changed."
Mr Salmond, who arrived at the event at the St Stephens' entrance to parliament separately from other SNP MPs, said: "When I was last here we had to run around to look like a crowd - now we are a crowd.
"Obviously we are seeing a major change and shift in Scottish politics. Behind the number of MPs we are seeing a seismic shift - clearly Scotland is on a journey, there's no doubt about that whatsoever.
"But Nicola Sturgeon was quite right - the election result was not a mandate for independence or for a referendum on independence."
Asked how he would adjust from being first minister to a Commons back bencher, Mr Salmond added: "I loved being first minister but everything has its time and I think things are turning out not too badly."
Ms Sturgeon has already issued calls for more powers for Holyrood in the wake of the SNP's election success.
She wants business taxation and control over welfare to be devolved as "priorities", and will meet the prime minister in the coming weeks to discuss the issue.
Some Tory politicians have urged Mr Cameron to offer the SNP full fiscal autonomy.
The policy, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said would leave a multibillion-pound shortfall in Scotland's finances, was contained in the SNP's election manifesto.
Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, who served as Scottish secretary in John Major's Conservative government, said a White Paper on full fiscal autonomy was needed.
He told the BBC's Today programme: "They got 50% of the vote and 95% of the seats and the reality is you have to respond to that and I think what the government needs to do is produce a White Paper which sets out how fiscal autonomy, devo-max, call it what you will, would work in practice so people are aware of the advantages and the disadvantages.
"The big advantage being Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP would not be able to produce fantasy manifestos that promise the earth without having the responsibility of raising the money to pay for it."
Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling, who led last year's campaign against independence, told the same programme that he believed the cross-party Smith Commission agreement on more powers for Scotland which was agreed after the referendum had been "completely overtaken by events".
He added: "It won't do the business for Scotland, it's lopsided, therefore it is unfair on England - and if you compound that, as David Cameron has suggested, by saying that essentially English MPs will decide tax and spending, you are well on the way to breaking up the Union."
Mr Darling said the UK instead needed to move towards a federal solution by offering substantially more powers and responsibilities to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
He added: "Critically they have got to be more responsible for raising the money to pay for things, but at the same time you remove this anomaly where, when I was an MP, I could vote for English education, but I couldn't vote for Scottish education.
"That's got to be dealt with, there's no question about that. But I think if we're intelligent about this we've got a chance for building a constitution for the 21st Century."

article Chasing 167 to reclaim the trophy they won in 2013, the Steelbacks needed 21 to win off the final over.
It proved beyond them as the Red Rose county triumphed in their third final appearance, having finished runners-up last year.
Alex Davies top-scored with 47 off 26 balls in Lancashire's 166-7, with Northants mustering 153-6 in reply.
Not even a late display of power-hitting from Shahid Afridi (26 off 18 balls), who dislocated the finger of James Faulkner with one shot drilled back at the Australian, could see the Steelbacks to their target.
Lancashire, led by former Warwickshire and England one-day coach Ashley Giles, had earlier conquered tricky batting conditions to launch their innings with a stand of 77 between Davies and Ashwell Prince (43) and then add 31 runs from the last three overs to post an imposing total.
In reply, Josh Cobb finished unbeaten on 44 from 37 balls for Northants, but he was left stranded at the wrong end as they came up short.
It was an unusual Finals Day at Edgbaston, where two low-scoring semi-finals had preceded the evening's showpiece.
Lancashire found strength in their spin department as they coasted to a six-wicket win against Hampshire, with Stephen Parry and Arron Lilley producing combined figures of 5-32 and their value shone through again in the final.
Captain Steven Croft chipped in with his slow variations alongside Parry and Lilley and the trio took 2-67 from their 10 overs as Northants struggled to keep the required rate down.
Parry finished the competition as joint leading wicket-taker with team-mate Faulkner, the pair claiming 25 victims each to emphasise their value to the Red Rose county.
Pakistan all-rounder Afridi had only arrived a few hours before the start of Finals Day after his flight to the UK was delayed, having played six games for the Steelbacks earlier in the competition before departing for the Caribbean Premier League.
His spin bowling proved highly effective as he produced superb figures of 3-14 in the final.
But later, just as he looked set to mount one of his trademark destructive T20 innings to pull off an unlikely victory, rookie Lancashire seam bowler Gareth Griffiths dismissed him for 26 with the help of a catch at deep point by Liam Livingstone.
It was only 21-year-old Griffiths' second T20 appearance for Lancashire, having made his debut in the semi-final earlier in the day.
Once Afridi was back in the dugout at 133-5 in the 18th over, the task was beyond Northants.
Ahead of England's limited-overs series against Australia, Northants all-rounder David Willey and Lancashire wicketkeeper Jos Buttler were both in action for their respective sides.
After Willey's heroic century off 41 balls in the Steelbacks' quarter-final win against Sussex, the left-hander, who will join Yorkshire next season, was unable to replicate it on the big occasion as he holed out off James Faulkner.
With the ball, he had followed up his 3-30 in the semi-final win against Birmingham Bears with 2-21 to check Lancashire's progress after a positive start by Davies and Ashwell Prince (43), who put on 77 for the first wicket.
Buttler's summer without a big score with the bat continued as he made 10 and 27 in his two innings on the day and it was his Lancashire wicketkeeping understudy Davies who walked away with the man of the match award, despite dropping a skier by Cobb in the covers as the Northants innings neared its climax.
Lancashire all-rounder James Faulkner:
"We brought our 'A' game today and played well as a group. I'm really happy for Princey (Ashwell Prince) and Gilo (Ashley Giles) and I've enjoyed my time at Lancashire.
"It's a nice finish and I'm really happy for everyone involved with the team. It's a team sport and I'm pumped for everyone involved.
"Finals Day is completely different to everywhere else in the world, it's unique. The support all the teams had here was phenomenal and it will be a day I'll never forget."
Northants batsman Josh Cobb:
"It's a massive disappointment. We were underdogs to a lot of people, but we were backing ourselves to go out and win it.
"We can be proud to get to the final, but it is a shame not to get over the line.
"While I was there I was always backing myself, but I probably needed someone to play a good cameo at the other end.
"Unfortunately we lose Willo (David Willey, joining Yorshire in 2016), who's exceptional for our T20 side, but there's a lot of talent in our squad who can step up and maybe we can come back next year."

article I'm scared because there is also a clock counting down in the bottom right-hand corner so something important must be about to happen like the arrival of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse but it turns out Shaun Batt has joined Leyton Orient from Millwall instead. On loan.
Welcome to Transfer Deadline Day, which I've deliberately written in capitals because there are those who think we should make it a public holiday.
Chaotic and stressful and full of panic buying, Transfer Deadline Day and the window that precedes it make up football's equivalent of the Yuletide season, with Sky Sports' Jim White playing its equivalent of Santa. "Sorry, no joy with Fabregas, I brought you Fellaini instead."
A magnificent irony of transfer windows is that they were introduced in 2002-03 in part to stabilise the game.
It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs
Transfer windows were part of a compromise deal between football authorities and the European Commission, with the sport insisting on contractual stability for players, and clubs investing in those players, in exchange for freedom of movement at prescribed times of the year.
Yet there is nothing stable about transfer windows and the media coverage that attends them. Indeed, Transfer Deadline Days in Britain, which generate mind-boggling numbers for a wide range of media outlets, have come to resemble the NFL draft in the United States.
But here is another irony. The NFL draft is by some measures the second biggest sports story in the United States in any given year because it is the principal means of player acquisition and a genuine game-changer. With the weakest team getting first pick, it democratises the league, theoretically giving every team an equal chance on any given Sunday.
In contrast, Transfer Deadline Days involve an awful lot of acquisitions across an unlevel playing field that often change nothing, but still generate enough hot air to make it seem as if they might.
"It's a period of time that is false and everything during that period of time is forced," says Gary Johnson, manager of Championship side Yeovil.
"Everybody has a little panic for the simple reason that the supporters demand a big name, or at least hope for one, and some of this is driven by the media. But for smaller clubs it's very difficult to get someone in that people can gasp at."
It is difficult to find a manager who is a fan of transfer windows, whether they manage in the Premier League or the lower reaches of the Football League.
Ian Holloway, who managed Blackpool and, briefly, Crystal Palace in the Premier League, reckons transfer windows are "utter madness" and lead to "the headlong hurtling into deals to rescue dreams".
"They encourage knee-jerk reactions, inflated transfer fees and wages and minimal planning and background checks," adds Holloway, who parted company with Palace in October and is now at Millwall.
Johnson, whose side sit second from bottom in the Championship table, spends his Januarys being assailed by hordes of agents hawking players he had never heard of. Like a tourist in an exotic flea market, he usually ends up with something he doesn't really know what to do with.
"You don't want to miss anyone," said Johnson. "So you look them up on the computer, find out what they can and can't do. But players with good character are unbelievably difficult to get."
Other managers of smaller clubs lucky enough to have coveted players on their books see transfer windows as tantamount to restraint of trade.
The Premier League's counter argument is that either you have contractual stability for players and the squad stability that brings, or you have players being sacked at the drop of a hat or leaving at the drop of a wallet, to borrow a phrase from former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein.
However, Holloway believes the old system, whereby clubs were allowed to buy and sell players up until and including the third week in March, was a more stable one, in that it allowed clubs to formulate long-term strategies away from the media and fan frenzy that constitutes a transfer window.
Critics of the January window point to Harry Redknapp's maniacal spending spree last year, when the then recently appointed QPR boss paid more than £20m for Loic Remy and Chris Samba, as evidence that long-term strategies become secondary to short-term fantasies during football's silly season. QPR were relegated a few months later.
Meanwhile, League Managers' Association chief executive Richard Bevan argues that so many managers are being sacked during the January transfer window and the weeks leading up to it because twitchy owners are unwilling to hand their money over to someone who is perceived to be failing.
In addition, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the system causes unrest in the dressing room, in that an out-of-favour player might spend from November to the end of January agitating for a move, or going through the motions for fear of suffering an injury and scuppering a possible move, or worrying that they are about to be supplanted by a new signing and losing motivation as a result.
Wenger, however, has no compunction about causing unrest in rival teams' dressing rooms, having upset Newcastle boss Alan Pardew with a late bid for midfielder Yohan Cabaye last August.
The Premier League argues that a smart manager is one who is best able to deal with all these dressing room kerfuffles and play with the cards they were dealt at the start of the season.
Wenger's main complaint has always been with the January window in particular, which he believes distorts the competitive balance midway through a season. Why, asks Wenger, should a club be able to buy their way out of trouble at the expense of a poorer club which had their house in order before the season started?
Wenger's argument is moot for two reasons. First, the old system meant rich clubs were able to run riot with their cheque books for most of the season, not just in January. Second, the January window is effectively a sop to the European Commission and its directives on freedom of movement.
As it is, players' union Fifpro claims the current regulations impede players' freedom of movement and is preparing to challenge the system in the European courts.
And while some fans will be of the opinion that well-remunerated players don't deserve the same rights as the rest of us and should take their 50 grand a week and stop complaining, other fans will find it bizarre that footballers, many of them on modest salaries, have fewer rights than other workers.
Wenger does have a point in his criticism of the timing of the summer transfer window. As it stands, the window closes two weeks after the start of the season, meaning a player might play two or three games for one club before being poached by another.
"The first game of the season would be a good time to close it," says Redknapp. "Then we could all concentrate on the football."
The present system was introduced ahead of the 2002-03 season, as part of a compromise with the European Commission.
There are two transfer windows each season.
The first one for English football commences on 1 July and usually ends at 23:00 BST on 31 August.
The second transfer window begins at midnight on 31 December and ends at 23:00 GMT on 31 January, or the first working day after that date.
Before the introduction of the transfer window, players could be traded throughout the season up until 31 March.
Each national football federation has its own registration period, so international transfers can take place if the window in the country of the buying club is still open.
Free agents can be signed at any time during the season as long as they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.

The difficulty of co-ordinating the transfer window in England with other European leagues is the principal reason why the summer window has not been moved forward.
But another reason is that the media and football fans, unlike Redknapp, do not want to concentrate solely on the football. They want to concentrate on Redknapp chatting with reporters about the transfer window through the window of his Range Rover.
When transfer windows were introduced, they were seen as potentially damaging for the red tops, for which transfer tittle-tattle was a staple. But the British media have adapted, turning transfer windows into feeding frenzies for football fans of a dramatic persuasion. Which is most of them.
Last January, disaffected (you read that word a lot in the football pages in January) West Bromwich Albion striker Peter Odemwingie was spotted outside Loftus Road on Transfer Deadline Day, caught in the act of trying to force through a move to QPR off his own bat.
The Odemwingie Fiasco, as it came to be known, had some of the ingredients of a caper movie: brinksmanship, silliness, adventure and audacity, as well as the comedy of embarrassment. And the British media milked it for all it was worth.
And it is in January, when few Premier League powerhouses do big business because of players' involvement in European competition and many trades in the Football League consist of low-key loans, that the British media really excels, making fans believe there is a mega signing lurking around every corner.
"All we're trying to do is nick players here and there," says Gary Johnson, exposing the unglamorous truth for the majority of Football League clubs.
"It's about ducking and diving, maybe finding a player whose mother-in-law lives in Taunton, 10 miles down the road from Yeovil. Which isn't on most sat-navs."
Who knows which players will find their way to Yeovil this Transfer Deadline Day. But if anyone does, it will be a case of ignore the football and feel the superlatives. And try to forget he's only there on loan.

article "We should adopt a position by July [on the force]", European Council President Donald Tusk said.
It would have a stronger mandate than the current Frontex border agency, which suffers from a lack of resources.
Record numbers of migrants have reached Italy and Greece by boat this year.
Greece is the biggest headache for the EU, as many migrants travel north from there without being registered.
Hungary was the first to build a fence to stem the flow, but more fences have gone up. The return of many border controls has undermined the Schengen freedom of movement principle.
Worries about the 26-nation Schengen zone - where passport checks are largely absent - dominated the Brussels summit.
EU members are "failing to protect our external borders", Mr Tusk said.
But Mr Tusk stressed after talks that "we can be a bit more optimistic because all the leaders agreed to protect Schengen".
He also said that extra Frontex staff would be deployed in Greece this month.
Concern about the infiltration of jihadists soared after last month's atrocities in Paris, adding to concerns about people traffickers and other criminals crossing EU borders easily.
But Hungary and Poland insist that the new EU border force must not undermine national sovereignty.
The European Commission plan says the EU must have authority to deploy the force even to a country that did not request it, if necessary. But it would still operate alongside national border staff.
Also on Thursday, EU leaders discussed a bid by British Prime Minister David Cameron to reform his country's relationship with the EU.
European Council president Donald Tusk said the talks represented a "make or break moment".

The fight against terrorism is expected to feature heavily on Friday after it emerged at least two of the Paris attackers used the migrant route to travel to France.
But writing in his summit invitation, European Council President Donald Tusk was keen to keep migration and terror as separate issues.
"The protection of our external borders is not intended to scare off those who flee wars or persecution," he said.
Many of the migrants are refugees from the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
924,147
arrivals by sea up to 11 December
219,000 arrivals in 2014
3,619 dead or missing in 2015
64% of arrivals to Greece are from Syria
As a tumultuous year draws to a close, European leaders are struggling to maintain unity, the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels says.
The UN's refugee agency says 954,481 migrants and refugees have landed on Europe's shores this year, and more than 800,000 of them have arrived in Greece.
Most travel north via the Western Balkans to countries such as Germany and Sweden.

article The bus smashed into a roadside barrier on a national highway and caught fire, Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) reported.
It had been bringing the group of Chinese tourists to Taoyuan Airport to catch a flight back to Dalian.
Officials said there were 24 tourists on board plus a local guide and driver.
"The fire moved very fast. All 26 died," Lu Jui-yao, an official with the National Highway Police Bureau told Reuters.
Pictures from the scene showed thick black smoke and flames engulfing the bus.
The cause of the crash, shortly before 13:00 (05:00 GMT), was not immediately known. Taiwan authorities are still investigating.
Taiwanese cabinet spokesman Tung Chen-yuan said tourism government officials had reached out to their mainland counterparts and would arrange for relatives of the victims to come to Taiwan.

article Edinburgh, 46, was dismissed on Tuesday with the Gills 17th in the League One table and Scally unhappy with their form during 2016.
"I am not even convinced I am going to go down the manager route as we are looking at other alternatives now," Scally told BBC Radio Kent.
"We may have a head coach and a team of coaches, with a director of football."
LISTEN: Gillingham chairman Scally on Edinburgh sacking
He added: "There are lots of very good coaches out there who can do specific parts of the work.
"There are lots who have done well at different levels and we are looking at a combination at the moment."
Gillingham had been in the automatic promotion places in February last year, but a slump in form led to the Kent club finishing last season ninth in the table, five points off the play-offs.
Their inconsistent form continued this campaign, with Scally criticising performances following the FA Cup defeat by non-league Brackley Town in November.
The Priestfield Stadium side won just 13 of their 46 league games in 2016, and are eight points above the relegation zone.
"The team is the most expensive one we have ever had under my reign, and the club's history," Scally said.
"It isn't performing to the level I think it should be. If we carry on with the current performance there is a chance we will get dragged into a relegation battle."
Scally, who returned to work this week after two months recovering from a heart operation, says he will have the managerial situation addressed "very quickly".
Former Gills defender Ady Pennock is among the bookmakers' favourites to fill the vacancy with the first team next in action at Oldham on Saturday, 14 January.
"I am feeling fairly good and strong but it is not the start to the New Year and my return that I wanted," Scally added.
"There will be lots of names put forward, but people who have had a taste of Premier League and Championship football want to stay there.
"There are lots of options and we have a number of applications, as always. There is no cheap option."

"She was beautiful inside and out and she brought something special to everyone she met.
"We are all utterly devastated. Her children are devastated. It is so tragic and we can't ever understand why anyone would do this.
"We would like to thank the school for their support.
"The teachers and kids have been brilliant and their support means so much to us. Julie was like a mam to them all."

article Harrison Ford, who plays space smuggler Solo, last appeared in a Star Wars film more than 30 years ago when Return of the Jedi was released in 1983.
The footage from the new film was included in a trailer shown at an official fan convention in California.
The Force Awakens is set for release on 18 December and is the first in a new series of the sci-fi franchise.
The event was also streamed live on the internet.
Ford, 72, is still recovering after crashing his plane onto a golf course and was unable to attend the Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim.
Original trilogy actors Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who also return after three decades as Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in The Force Awakens, were on stage to answer fans' questions.
Hamill paid tribute to the franchise's supporters. "Over the years, all my entire life, I've felt such love from you," he told the thousands in the audience.
"You're more than just fans. You're family."
Hamill and Fisher were joined by other cast members, including the two young British actors who play central roles in the film, Daisy Ridley and John Boyega.
The relatively unknown Ridley, speaking for the first time about her role in Star Wars as a scavenger called Rey, described her as "very solitary until she meets another character and an adventure begins".
She added: "[I] cannot wait to show you guys what we've done."
John Boyega said he was excited but also nervous. "I was scared to tell my parents that I'd got the part of Finn", he admitted.
He added he had only told them once the official casting announcement had been made.
The film's director JJ Abrams was also on the special panel which launched the four-day Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim.
He said he had had a lot of fun making the movie as well as feeling a huge amount of pressure in "honouring the legacy" of the Star Wars series.
"Though there are moments of sheer horror, the opportunity far outweighs the risk," Abrams said.
Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind the Star Wars films, in 2012.
The first teaser trailer for the The Force Awakens was released in November.
The film was shot last year at Pinewood Studios near London.

article The teams were tied at five points apiece at half-time but the Red Hands ran out 0-10 to 0-08 winners in a game played in difficult conditions.
Lee Brennan scored three points in the first half but Tyrone failed to shake off Cavan until late in the match.
Justin McMahon and Connor McAliskey pointed within 30 seconds to make it 0-10 to 0-7, then Killian Clarke replied.
Goalkeeper Michael O'Neill made his debut for Tyrone, while Darren McCurry was handed a start and Mark Bradley was drafted in to play instead of Peter Harte, who came on as a second-half substitute.
Brennan (3), Bradley and McAliskey were the point-scorers for the hosts in the first half, with Niall McDermott, Martin Reilly (2), Eugene Keating and Gearoid McKiernan registering scores for the Breffnimen.
McKiernan added his second after the break, but Mattie Donnelly, Rory Brennan and McCurry responded to nudge Mickey Harte's outfit two points ahead.
Cian Mackey reduced the deficit to a point, but that quickfire double from McMahon and McAliskey gave Tyrone some breathing space and they saw out the game, despite Clarke's late consolation.
Tyrone are away to Galway next week, with Cavan at home to Derry in another Ulster derby.
Tyrone manager Mickey Harte: "That was a hard-fought victory played in difficult conditions and very inclement weather. Fortunately we came away with the two points.
"The number of wides is a concern for us, the percentage of scores from shots taken and from free-kicks, but that will take time.
"Today was all about the result but there is lots of work to do in terms of our performance and things we can do better."

article The mother of two had to cope with big changes in her life after a back injury ended her participation in endurance mountain bike racing.
Injury or disability doesn't have to define who you are or what you can do
And, after an incredible few years that have seen her go from never having been in a canoe to winning a gold medal at the Rio Paralympics, she is ready to embrace new challenges and pass on what she has learnt to others.
"The last four years in elite sport couldn't have gone any better and it would be difficult to top the experience," says Dickins.
"It's been an amazing adventure but there are still so many other adventures in the world that I want to have."
It's that positive attitude that was severely tested when Dickins, a physiotherapist by trade, ruptured a disc in her back following a freak combination of circumstances and found herself struggling to cope with the consequences.
She started to volunteer as a physio at cycling meetings and, as a result, was taken on as a Games Maker at London 2012.
"The whole Games in London were incredible and the dedication and commitment of the cyclists at the velodrome where I was working was palpable," she reflects.
"It made me want to try a new sport just to see if I could do it."
Find out how to get into disability sport with our special guide.
A chance conversation over a coffee with a fellow volunteer pointed her in the direction of Paracanoe - as a sport she could do despite her weak leg - and, within weeks, she had gone from a complete novice to being enrolled on the British Canoeing programme with her mind set on Rio.
"I was particularly inspired by Helen Glover's story," adds Dickins.
"She won gold in the rowing after only four years in the sport and seeing her achievement made me think that Rio might be a pathway open to me.
"Everything about becoming an elite athlete was hard, but I looked at it all as a challenge and probably the hardest thing was juggling being a working mum and training at the same time."
But Dickins is also quick to acknowledge the help of others in her journey through the sport.
"I have learnt the power of being in a strong team - you don't have to do it on your own," she says.
And, on 16 September 2016, Dickins put all that work and assistance together to clinch the gold medal by 0.03 seconds at Lagoa in Rio.
"Finding out that I had won my race was definitely the highlight in Rio, as initially I wasn't sure who had won," adds Dickins.
"I can remember standing on the podium and listening to the national anthem as the flag was raised, with everyone cheering, it was surreal."
Since that incredible day, Dickins has been busy sharing her experiences with others.
She has given some 64 talks in the last 12 months to volunteer groups, schools and clubs and even individuals at BBC Sport Personality of the Year.
If what you are doing isn't working - try to  find a new approach
"One of my passions has been to give back, so I have done as many volunteer appearances as I could," says the Rio champion.
"I have met a huge variety of people and shared my experiences and I hope in some small way I have inspired the next generation."
It's something that hasn't gone unrecognised within the sport.
"Anne's own story of how she got involved in the sport is unique and it is fantastic to see her commitment to sharing her experiences with so many others," said British Canoeing performance director John Anderson.
So, having walked away from canoeing while she is at the top of her game, how does Dickins look back at that part of her life?
"Taking up a new sport and winning gold in Rio has completely changed my life," she admits.
"I have learnt so much about myself and feel a lot wiser because of it.
"I have learnt to accept that life isn't always fair but that's OK. That injury or disability doesn't have to define who you are or what you can do.
"I've learnt if what you are doing isn't working to try to think differently and find a new approach to make it happen."

article In an unanimous statement, it said the launches "constituted a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions".
It comes after the North test-fired two medium-range ballistic missiles, in the latest in a series of rocket launches.
Two weeks ago, the Security Council imposed its toughest sanctions to date on North Korea.
The measures were introduced after Pyongyang carried out its fourth nuclear test and fired a rocket that was widely seen as a disguised ballistic missile test.
The statement, which was backed by Pyongyang's ally China, also ordered the North to refrain from further actions that violate UN resolutions.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the latest firings were "deeply troubling" and urged Pyongyang to halt "these inflammatory and escalatory actions", his spokesman said.
US officials said the medium-range missiles, launched off the east coast, flew about 800km (500 miles) before falling into the water.
Ban also called on North Korea to comply with UN resolutions that bar the country from developing missile technology.

Earlier this week, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered multiple ballistic missile launches and a nuclear warhead test.
Meanwhile, the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University suggested that North Korea could carry out another nuclear test at any time.
The think-tank said that satellite imagery from Pyongyang's main testing site in Punggye-ri showed increased activity in the area, AFP news agency reported.

article Alan Goode, 73, of Wigston, Leicester, was jailed on 17 October 2013, after he was found lying on a cubicle floor in women's toilets.
He was discovered dead in the cell he shared with Krzysztof Mroz at HMP Lincoln, on 31 October.
Mroz, 36, was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after a four-day trial at Stafford Crown Court.
He was convicted of manslaughter with diminished responsibility.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Goode died from head injuries.
Mroz was originally charged with murder but during the course of the trial, jurors heard from medical experts that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack.
The court was told that although he was responsible for Mr Goode's death, he had been affected by an "abnormality in mental functioning".
After the case, Det Insp Helen Evans, of Lincolnshire Police, said: "I am satisfied with both the jury's verdict and the judge's ruling because this is an appropriate outcome in this case, which has been truly tragic for all involved.
"He will be detained in a secure establishment where he will not be a danger to anyone else and will also be given the treatment he needs."

article In an interview with Nick Robinson on Radio 4's Today programme, the justice secretary would only say the UK would "be part of the EU free trade zone" and would "have access to the countries of the single market being in a free trade zone".
Mr Gove's remarks further clarify the Leave campaign's approach to any future trade deal between Britain and the EU.
His comments rule out any idea of a post-Brexit UK government seeking to replicate a trade deal on the lines of Norway or Switzerland, which offer free access to EU markets, but which also commit those countries to pay contributions to the EU budget and free movement of EU citizens across borders.
Sources in the Vote Leave campaign make clear that Mr Gove's and their own vision of a future trading relationship amounts to "redefining the single market, not walking away from it".
In other words, they hope to realise an unprecedented deal in which the UK trades with European states free of tariff and non-tariff barriers, but without commitment to the full range of EU trading rules which, in turn, would expose the UK to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
David Cameron and colleagues in the Remain campaign argue this would be impossible; that EU leaders have no stake in facilitating a seamless and cost-free transition which might encourage other EU members to head towards the EU exit door.
On Sunday, the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, suggested on the Andrew Marr show that Britain would be "completely killed" in trade talks if the country chose to leave the EU.
Leave.EU campaign figures argue this is posturing, designed to deter a vote to leave. A vote to quit the EU would confront these leaders, and everyone else, with a "new reality" in which political posturing would give way to hard-headed economic interests.
A trade war, they suggest, would be mutually destructive and would not be allowed to take place.
Fine details of what a comprehensive post-Brexit might entail will not be offered today by Mr Gove, or by any of his fellow campaigners in future. No such plan exists. It would emerge, necessarily, from hard negotiations.
The campaign is also aware that a line-by-line blueprint would invite a line-by-line rebuttal from David Cameron, his fellow Remain campaigners and colleagues across the EU.
But in its absence, the campaign can look forward to be accused of inviting British voters to take a dangerous leap into the dark.

article The UK athlete and campaigner wanted to meet the Russian Minster of Defence to discuss the creation of a new marine reserve around the Ross Sea.
Sergey Shoygu is also the president of the Russian Geographical Society.
Despite international tensions, Mr Pugh believes that their conversation could help the world to reach an agreement on the proposed protected zone.
The Ross Sea covers that slice of Antarctica claimed by New Zealand, and from which teams associated with Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen all mounted polar forays.
The sea is one of the last regions in Earth's oceans still regarded as near-pristine and unaffected by human activities. But there is deadlock over giving it a special designation.
Speaking of his Russian encounter, Mr Pugh told the BBC: "This is the first time that Antarctica has been discussed at this level.
"Until now, it hasn't got this far. They indicated that there is an appetite for dialogue and for peace.
"When you take off your clothes, there are no barriers. You can talk person to person."
However, Mr Pugh, who is the UN Environment Programme Patron of the Oceans, warned that it would be a lengthy process, particularly given the international disagreements over Ukraine.
"The relationship between the US and Russia and the United Kingdom and Russia is very strained. This is the most serious crisis that these parties have faced since the Cold War. There are no bilaterals happening at this stage."
As part of a series of Antarctic swims, this month Mr Pugh swam further south than anyone has swum before. Breaking his own record, he said that the Bay of Whales in the Ross Sea was "the most terrifying place" that he had ever swum. The average sea temperature was -1C , with an air temperature of -37C.
The Ross Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA) has been discussed for the last four years and it has failed four times. The last proposal was vetoed by Russia and China.
It would be the size of the UK, Germany and France put together, and needs 24 countries and the EU all to agree.
Mr Pugh said: "If you look at the 1959 Antarctic Treaty, this was concluded at the height of cold war. All of the parties set aside land, the continent, as a place of peace and science.
"I hope that Antarctica could be used as a bridge, as a place where we could try to find common ground. My hope is that this would ripple northwards."

article "The truth is, I didn't know if I was going to make it," he revealed during an on-stage interview at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in central London.
"Life was no longer interesting to me, so it took a lot to get me better."
Jett Travolta died at the age of 16 in January 2009 from a seizure during a family holiday in the Bahamas.
Both his father and his mother Kelly Preston have since confirmed their eldest son was autistic and had a history of seizures.
The couple have two other children: 13-year-old daughter Ella Bleu and three-year-old son Benjamin.
Travolta said he "didn't want to wake up" following Jett's death and that the Church of Scientology had been pivotal to his recovery in the weeks and months afterwards.
"I will forever be grateful to Scientology for supporting me for two years solid, I mean Monday through Sunday," he continued.
"They didn't take a day off, working through different angles of the techniques to get through grief and loss, and to make me feel that finally I could get through a day."
The 59-year-old has been a follower of the controversial religion since the 1970s and said it had "saved his life" on more than one occasion.
Travolta's 90-minute appearance saw him field questions about various aspects of his life, career and keen interest in aviation.
Also addressed was the mid-career slump that followed his appearances in Saturday Night Fever and Grease, a downturn that was only arrested when Quentin Tarantino cast him as a heroin-abusing hitman in 1994's Pulp Fiction.
"It got a little complicated for a few years," the actor explained. "A lot of things added up to a five-year period that wasn't so good for me."
Travolta went on to thank Tarantino for facilitating his career comeback. "There were people who were much hotter than me who wanted the role," he explained.
"But Quentin put his career on the line and refused to make the movie without me in it."
The film ended up securing Travolta his second Oscar nomination, following the best actor citation he received for Saturday Night Fever in 1978. To date, though, the actor has yet to win one of the Academy's coveted statuettes.
Yet the star did not seem unduly perturbed. "I don't feel at all ignored or not verified," he told Norman, erstwhile host of the BBC's Film programme. "You're not going to find a bitter guy in me."
Sunday's event, held near to, and at the same time as, this year's Bafta Film Awards, came two days before the actor's 60th birthday and ended with him being presented with a cake shaped like an airplane.
Members of the audience were invited on stage at one point for an impromptu dance lesson, while a discussion on James Bond led to the star impersonating Scottish icon Sir Sean Connery.
"I would love to be a villain in the next James Bond film," Travolta continued, revealing he had openly courted the role during an informal meeting with producer Barbara Broccoli.
The actor's appearance followed similar "evenings with" Al Pacino and Sylvester Stallone in London, tickets for which have been offered for as much as Â£350.

article There's a school of thought that seems to suggest if you wave a laptop or something shiny and digital at the classroom, learning will somehow mysteriously improve.
Digital technology is associated with the classroom of the future. And if you throw iPads into the mix, you're even more likely to hear the language of an over-optimistic tomorrow.
So you might not expect to find tablet computers being deployed to defend a language first written down 1,700 years ago when "writing on a tablet" would have meant carving on a stone.
But in an innovative blend of ancient and modern, online technology is being used to keep alive teaching in the Irish language.
And Apple, the Californian technology giant, is using this schools project in the west of Ireland as a signpost for a much more ambitious, global application of iPads in education.
The problem that it's trying to solve is how to provide a full range of textbooks and teaching materials for a small, specialist, under-served area of education.
The number of schools in Ireland teaching through the Irish language has grown sharply in recent years, after near extinction in the early 1970s. But in total there are still fewer than 250 primary and secondary schools.
"It doesn't make sense for publishers to put money into translating text books from English," says Sean O'Gradaigh, lecturer in the school of education at the National University of Ireland, Galway.
He says you can Google any topic for teaching in English and find hundreds of textbooks and resources, but there are very few useful equivalents in Irish, because the market is too small.
It means there is demand from Irish language schools, but not enough resources to breathe life into the teaching.
Mr O'Gradaigh's response has been to use tablet computers - in this case iPads - to produce digital textbooks that can be downloaded and shared by Irish language schools.
The university in Galway is the teacher-training centre for schools teaching in Irish, and its students have become part of this digital self-publishing enterprise.
As part of their training, students are required to learn about educational technology. But Mr O'Gradaigh has some uncompromising views on this.
"Teaching technology is pointless, it's obsolete in two years," he said.
Instead 80 trainee teachers learn by making their own digital content and finding the best ways of using their own expanding library of materials.
In this contrast of old and new, the current cohort of student teachers use tablet computers throughout their training.
All their course materials are contained on iPads, and they use them to create and publish digital books.
Irish language schools are big users of technology, says Mr O'Gradaigh. In about three-quarters of secondary schools, all the teaching staff will have their own iPad. In one in five schools, every pupil will have their own.
The big picture here is that schools and academics have become the authors and publishers of their own specialist textbooks. And because it is online and digital, it can be replicated and shared immediately.
"There are schools which are deciding not to buy books any more," says Mr O'Gradaigh.
It's not just about the Irish language.
His own subject is geography, and he says printed books are out of date within a few years.
The digital versions can be updated. But he says that just as important is that they can be "personalised and localised". Individual teachers can adapt materials for the needs of their individual class.
Mr O'Gradaigh sees the shift to digital publishing for schools as being a "no brainer".
And it's bubbling away as one of the next big things in educational technology.
Merlin John, an education technology commentator who is about to publish a book about using mobile devices, says schools are beginning to show how they can "personalise support materials and make considerable savings on textbooks through the use of digital devices".
In the UK, the Stephen Perse Foundation school in Cambridge, a recent winner of the Independent School of the Year award, has published digital materials for dozens of courses and made them free online through iTunes U.
It means that any pupils or other schools can download the resources created in this top-performing school for GCSEs, A-levels and International Baccalaureate subjects.
But it's not all tablets and Apple. Google's Chromebook and the Google Apps for Education have been challenging the iPad in the education sector, particularly in US schools.
This month, the New York City school system, with a million pupils, signed a deal supporting the use of Google apps for its schools, but leaving the final choice up to teachers.
Whether it's Apple or the Big Apple or the west of Ireland, who better than schools to know what schools need best?
Tricia Kelleher, head of the Stephen Perse Foundation school, said teachers could now "create and curate" their own content.
"This is not an experience offered by static textbooks," she said.
"Digital technology really does open up the possibility of schools becoming publishing houses."

article The main parliamentary opposition, the Muslim Brotherhood, was reduced from 20% of the seats in the previous parliament to zero.
The second largest group, the liberal Wafd party, won a mere three seats in the first round of elections (out of a total of 518 seats). The results strained the credulity of even those most sympathetic to the regime.
Egypt has in the past at least allowed the appearance of democracy, though not necessarily the substance. Within constraints, the opposition was allowed to participate.
The parliament, while ultimately dominated by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), had, in recent years, come somewhat alive. There was a relatively boisterous independent press. Elections were rigged but not stolen outright.
None of this, of course, changed the outcome - a repressive regime that refused to share power - but it did, at least, give the opposition an opening.
That opening is now gone. It is worth noting that the results of 28 November were genuinely surprising to nearly everyone, including NDP officials who had hoped for a more "credible" result.
It would be misleading to say that Egypt is "on the brink" - as several experts have recently claimed - although it may be.
Analysts have long warned that the Egyptian regime, while seemingly durable, is increasingly unpopular and perceived as illegitimate.
Meanwhile, Egyptians themselves, long accused of political passivity, have taken to the streets in unprecedented numbers, protesting against their country's economic and political deterioration.
This does not mean Egypt, one of America's closest allies in the region, will fall. But with these most recent elections, the regime has over-reached.
In opting to wipe out its opposition, and with such lack of subtlety, it has made a major and potentially debilitating miscalculation.
The regime has lost whatever legitimacy it had left. More importantly, however, it has breathed new life into what was just one month ago an aimless, fractious opposition that couldn't agree on whether or not to boycott the elections.
Repression, when it reaches a certain level, can help unify an otherwise divided opposition. The Brotherhood and the Wafd, wary of each other in the lead-up to elections, are now promising greater co-operation. They will have to; the regime no longer has anything to offer them.
Meanwhile, Egypt will have a parliament but one with virtually no opposition. The Egyptian regime appears unaware of something its neighbours have long known: the most effective autocracies are the ones that manage rather than destroy their opposition.
And with no-one to fight, the NDP may very well end up fighting itself. Rather unwittingly, the ruling party has created the very political context most likely to tear it apart.
There are reports, and much speculation, about internal rifts within the regime over who will succeed the ailing president, Hosni Mubarak, now nearly 30 years in power. And for the first time since he took over, no-one is quite sure who the next president will be.
Gamal Mubarak, the president's son, has long been the favourite but there are those in the NDP who are searching quietly - and sometimes not so quietly - for an alternative.
Political scientists Guillermo O'Donnell and Philippe Schmitter, in their book Transitions from Authoritarian Rule, write that "there is no transition whose beginning is not the consequences - direct or indirect - of important divisions within the authoritarian regime itself". Those divisions, in Egypt, are only likely to grow.
For the NDP to make a strategic blunder at such a crucial moment in Egypt's history suggests a regime that is nervous, unsure of itself and increasingly incoherent.
This was the first such mistake. Whether there will be more - and whether the opposition manages to capitalise - will determine the course Egypt takes in the coming, critical months.

article Instead, there could be two periods of 30 minutes with the clock stopped whenever the ball goes out of play.
Lawmaking body the International Football Association Board (Ifab) says matches only see about 60 minutes of "effective playing time" out of 90.
The idea is one of several put forward in a new strategy document designed to address football's "negativities".
Another proposal would see players not being allowed to follow up and score if a penalty is saved - if the spot-kick "is not successful", play would stop and a goal-kick awarded.
Other ideas include a stadium clock linked to a referee's watch and a new rule allowing players to effectively pass to themselves or dribble the ball when taking a free-kick.
Former Chelsea striker Gianfranco Zola is in favour of the proposal to cut matches to 60 minutes.
"I personally like this rule because there are so many teams who try to take advantage of it because they are winning and wasting time - so I think it is not a bad rule," he told the BBC.
"Football is fast enough. Some of the changes I don't like very much, but this is a good one."
Arsenal keeper Petr Cech echoed Zola's sentiments as he discussed the proposal on social media and wrote that at present there are "25 minutes of effective playing time per half so you would actually see more football".
The ideas have been put forward to Ifab by stakeholders in the game to tackle "on-field issues" and form part of what it calls its "Play Fair strategy", which has three aims of:
Part of the problem the new document highlights is that a 90-minute match has fewer than 60 minutes of playing time because of stoppages and time-wasting.
The document has put forward a number of radical ideas for discussion, but suggests some proposals can be implemented immediately without the need for law changes.
Most of these apply to trying to combat time-wasting. The document says match officials should be stricter on the rule which allows keepers to hold the ball for six seconds and be more stringent when calculating additional time.
Additionally, it suggests match officials stop their watch:
Some of the proposals are already being tested. The idea of only allowing captains to speak to referees - to prevent match officials being mobbed - will be trialled at this summer's Confederations Cup, which starts on Saturday.
Another proposal involves changing the order of kick-taking in penalty shoot-outs, known as 'ABBA'. It is similar to a tie-break in tennis, with team A taking the first kick, then team B taking two, then team A taking two. That is a change from the traditional 'team A, team B, team A, team B' pattern.
New suggestions also include players who are being substituted leaving at the closest part of the touchline to them instead of at the halfway line.
This is where it gets interesting. One of the proposals would allow being able to dribble straight from a free-kick to "encourage attacking play as the player who is fouled can stop the ball and then immediately continue their dribble/attacking move". Other measures include:
Ifab is made up of Fifa and the four British home football associations - of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - and is responsible for making the final decision on law changes.
Former English referee David Elleray is Ifab's technical director and has overseen the document.
"Referees, players, coaches and fans all agree that improving player behaviour and respect for all participants and especially match officials, increasing playing time and the game's fairness and attractiveness must be football's main priority," he said.
The next stage would involve the ideas being discussed at various meetings before decisions are taken on whether to develop them further or discard them.

article Sheikha Hamda al-Nahyan and her seven daughters hired a floor of rooms at a luxury hotel over eight months in 2008.
They brought with them from the United Arab Emirates a retinue of more than 20 servants whom they are accused of holding in conditions close to slavery.
The plaintiffs say they were prevented from leaving the hotel and forced to eat the princesses' leftovers.
The princesses are being tried in absentia along with an Indian butler.
If found guilty, they could face hundreds of thousands of euros in damages and even a prison sentence - but rights activists say it is highly unlikely that the UAE would extradite them to serve time behind bars.
Nonetheless, it would be "hugely significant" if one of the wealthiest families in the world was publicly linked with trafficking and slavery, says Nicholas McGeehan, an expert on migrant workers in the Gulf for Human Rights Watch.
He argues that despite being abolished in law, domestic slavery continues in Gulf states - "perpetuated by ruling elites for whom it serves an important societal purpose in conferring status".
He added: "It's top-down and tolerated."
The princesses deny the charges, and the BBC has contacted their defence for comment.
The case came to court on Thursday and was hearing from defence lawyers on Friday morning.
The case came to light when one of the servants escaped from the hotel.
One of the alleged victims told Belgian television that the women were detained in hotel rooms with private guards and prevented from going outside.
They had to be available to take orders 24 hours a day, slept on the floor in the princesses' rooms and forced to eat the princesses' leftovers. One who complained is alleged to have been deprived of food and water for three days.
As well as charges of inhumane treatment, the princesses are also accused of failing to procure the correct visas and work permits for their servants as well as failing to pay wages.
Legal challenges to proceedings by the defence have meant the case has taken nine years to get under way. They have challenged, for instance, whether the police had a legal mandate to enter the princesses' hotel suites.
The case was cleared to go to court in 2012, but the case has been stalled by procedural challenges, Stef Janssens told the BBC. He works for Belgian rights organisation Myria which has been supporting the alleged victims.
"The princesses are of course very important people with immense means and prestige, while the victims are very vulnerable," he said.
"The princesses hired three specialist lawyers who twice went to Belgium's highest court to challenge procedure. Not everyone has the means to do that."
The princesses carried out the alleged abuses in the same year that Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed, another member of the UAE's al-Nahyan ruling family, bought Manchester City football club.

article A bill was put forward by the minority Pirate Party, which campaigns for internet and data freedom.
It came after the deadly attack the same month against French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris.
The bill said it was "essential in a free society that the public can express themselves without fear of punishment".
As three members of the Pirate Party stood before parliament on Thursday, each said: "Je Suis Charlie", an expression used globally to express solidarity with the Charlie Hebdo victims.
After the ruling, the party wrote on its blog (in Icelandic): "Iceland's parliament has now established the important message that freedom will not give in to bloody attacks."
The blasphemy law had been in place since 1940, and anyone found guilty could have been sentenced to a fine or three months in prison.

The Iceland Monitor website said that the Church of Iceland supported the change, and quoted them as saying that "any legislative powers limiting freedom of expression in this way is at variance with modern-day attitudes towards human rights".
The Catholic Church of Iceland, the Pentecostal Church and the Church of Iceland's eastern province opposed the changes.
The Catholic Church wrote in comments submitted after the bill was proposed: "Should freedom of expression go so far as to mean that the identity of a person of faith can be freely insulted, then personal freedom - as individuals or groups - is undermined."
The Icelandic Ethical Humanist Association said that the new law included provisions to ensure that people could still be prosecuted for hate speech.
The Pirate movement was formed in Sweden in 2006 and has since spread to more than 60 countries.
None has seen as much success as the Icelandic branch, which says it is an "international political force fighting for genuine transparency and accountability in government".
In the 2013 election, it gained three MPs for the first time, and polls now say it is the most popular party in Iceland, with the support of 32.4% of the country.
In 2013, its members drafted a law calling for whistleblower Edward Snowden to be granted Icelandic citizenship.

article Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) was commissioned to investigate the movements of the iconic birds of prey after a spate of disappearances.
It found that 41 of 131 tracked birds disappeared between 2004 and 2016.
Scientists have ruled out the tags and wind farms as possible causes for the eagles vanishing.
The study also found that the majority of cases were in areas which are managed for grouse shooting.
Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, who commissioned the report, said: "The findings of this research are deeply concerning and will give rise to legitimate concerns that high numbers of golden eagles, and other birds of prey, continue to be killed in Scotland each year.
"There is every reason to believe that similar levels of persecution affect untagged golden eagles as well as those we are able to track via satellite tags.
"The continued killing of protected species of birds of prey damages the reputation of law-abiding gamekeepers, landowners and indeed the country as a whole."
She added: "This report identifies specific problem areas which will allow Police Scotland to adopt a targeted approach and I would also encourage members of the public to report any suspicious activity to the police.
"The range of measures we will introduce over the longer-term will build on the progress that we have made to date and tackle outdated practices and attitudes.
"By looking at ways of strengthening the legal protection for birds of prey we are sending out a strong message that Scotland's wildlife is for everyone to enjoy - not for criminals to destroy for their own ends."
A package of measures have been announced in response to the report, including the creation of an independently-led group to look at the environmental impact of grouse moor management practices.
The report indicated six key areas where clusters of bird disappearances had been identified.
They are Northern Monadhliaths; Angus Glens; East Grampians including Ladder Hills; and Glaick Forest/Glen Tilt, with broader clusters identified in the Upper Tay/Forth and South Loch Ness.
Ministers say they plan to review all legal measures which could be used to target those geographical areas of concern.
RSPB Scotland said the report's findings were "damaging and devastating".
Head of investigations Ian Thomson said he hoped it would prove to be a "watershed moment" for the conservation of birds of prey.
"The irrefutable evidence in this report, demonstrating the scale of systematic, organised criminality, is shocking - and yet it is likely that none of this would have come to light had these birds not been fitted with satellite tags," he said.
"When you add to this the disappearances of satellite-tagged white tailed eagles, red kites, goshawks, peregrines and hen harriers, not included this review, and consider that satellite-tagged birds form a very small proportion of the populations of these species, the overall numbers of eagles and other protected raptors that are actually being killed must be staggering."
He said the report validated concerns which RSPB Scotland had been expressing for decades.
"It completely bankrupts the myth that raptor persecution has been in steady decline for the last 20 years, which is something that is regularly said by representatives of the land management sector.
"What they need to do now is acknowledge the scale of the problem."
The Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said the loss of an average of four eagles a year was "totally unacceptable" and it "condemned wholeheartedly" the illegal killing of any eagle.
A spokesman for the group added: "Although this study assimilates 12 years of evidence and makes difficult reading, it does acknowledge recent improvements in some grouse moor areas previously associated with suspected persecution."
It said this had contributed to the "overall betterment" of the golden eagle's conservation status.
"That said, problems clearly still exist in some hotspot areas and, in our view, this can only be tackled by all partners having access to the same telemetry data in order to arrive at shared and targeted solutions," said the spokesman.
"If this had been happening over the past decade, there is a high likelihood these problems could have been tackled satisfactorily before now.
"The SGA does not believe the report adequately tackles the threat wind farms pose to raptor species as there is a significant amount of published data from other countries which show a negative correlation between bird survival and turbine strike.
"However, that is not an attempt in any way to detract from the report's findings."

Greek police said the criminal networks were also involved in smuggling people across borders.
About 100 people are still wanted in Greece and other countries.
Europol said the network was based in Athens and consisted of two criminal groups, one run by Sudanese people and another by Bangladeshis, and 16 people have been arrested in Greece.
Both groups forged passports, national ID cards, Schengen visas, driving licences, asylum seekers' registration cards and residence permits, police said.

But a live TV link to a judge sitting in court in Swansea failed to work.
Lee-Ann Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their son, and her nephew and niece died in the fire in 2012.
After the technical problems, the plea and case management hearing took place in a telephone conference room with the defendant, barristers, solicitors and court officials sitting in a small side room.
Defending barrister Gordon Cole QC indicated that his client would be pleading not guilty to all charges but the judge agreed that it would not be appropriate to do so over the telephone.
Judge Keith Thomas made various directions in advance of the trial, which will be held at Caernarfon Crown Court, starting on 16 November. Mr Liptrot was bailed pending that hearing.
He indicated not guilty pleas to all five charges of manslaughter, alleged to have occurred between 18 October and 6 November, 2012.
Melanie Smith has already been jailed for at least 30 years for five counts of murder after starting the fire in a row over a shared hallway.

The occurrence, known as heteropaternal superfecundation, is rare with few publicly known about.

"There are only less than 10 known cases of twins with different fathers in the world. There might be other cases but the parents and/or the twins were not aware of it or didn't want to announce it," he told the BBC's Nga Pham.
He declined to give further details citing client confidentiality, but added that local reports stating the twins' location, names and timeframe were inaccurate.

article Baroness Altmann, who left her post in Theresa May's reshuffle, said the policy had "outlived its purpose".
Since 2010, the "triple-lock" policy has meant that pensions rise by the inflation rate, average earnings or 2.5%, whichever is highest.
The government has said there are no plans to review the policy.
In an interview with The Observer, Lady Altmann said the cost of the triple lock would become "enormous" after 2020 and that dropping it would ensure billions of pounds could be spent on better causes.
"The triple lock is a political construct, a totemic policy that is easy for politicians to trumpet, but from a pure policy perspective keeping it forever doesn't make sense," she said, arguing instead for a "double lock" whereby the state pension increases in line with either prices or earnings.
Lady Altmann told the paper she had lobbied the former Prime Minister David Cameron last year to alter the policy, but he had blocked the change for political reasons.
In their 2015 election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to extend the triple lock until 2020.
Last month, in the run-up to the EU referendum, Mr Cameron said that pensioner benefits, which cost Â£90bn every year, were a "policy priority" but might have to be re-examined in a post-Brexit climate.
She said: "Absolutely we must protect pensioner incomes, but the 2.5% bit doesn't make sense.
"If, for example, we went into a period of deflation where everything, both earnings and prices, was falling then putting pensions up 2.5% is a bit out of all proportion.
"Politically nobody had the courage to stand up and say we have done what we needed to do," she added.
"The cost of the triple lock on the public finances from 2020 onwards is enormous. And if you reduce it to a double lock you save billions of pounds."
The triple lock had "fulfilled it purpose" and pensioner households were now "no more likely to be poor than other age groups", she said.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said Lady Altmann had no bearing on policy and "we have no plans to review it".
"This is just speculation on her part and we don't comment on speculation," the spokeswoman added.
Age UK responded by saying that that triple lock was important because it provided older people with financial security.
"It's also necessary to see the bigger picture: â€Žresearch shows that the State Pension is still the largest single source of income for most older people in the UK, with the vast majority having contributed to it throughout their long working lives," said Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK.
"1.6 million older people still live in poverty in the UK; and our State Pension is worth appreciably less than its equivalent in many other developed countries," she added.
Analysis: Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent
It doesn't take a genius to predict that the days of the triple lock may be numbered.
The Tories fought the last election on a commitment to keep it going, but that commitment only stands until 2020.
And of course David Cameron famously warned before the referendum that a victory for Leave would put the whole thing in question.
The reason is that in a low inflation environment, promising to raise the State Pension by at least 2.5% a year adds many billions to the cost of the system over decades.
A double lock isn't the only alternative. The lock could be scrapped completely. Or the government could consider a triple lock "lite" under which the guarantee of a minimum increase was drastically reduced.
Plus, there is another scenario, in which inflation - and perhaps wages â€” start to rise rapidly as a result of the drop in sterling and never look back.
In that scenario, a double lock would be just as generous as a triple lock.

article It follows claims that the draft Wales Bill was confusing, and would leave Welsh ministers with fewer powers.
The bill will be delayed until summer to allow time for changes, Mr Crabb said.
But First Minister Carwyn Jones called it an "avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess".
Mr Crabb said he would shorten the list of powers kept back by Westminster, cut red tape over new laws, and better reflect Wales in the legal system.
The new legislation is supposed to settle constitutional wrangling by making clear which powers were to be devolved and which not.
It includes areas such as energy, transport and elections.
But Welsh ministers have criticised the draft Wales Bill, saying some aspects of it would see them with fewer powers.
A report by the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, published on Sunday, called for a "pause" in the process.
The MPs said a proposed list of powers that are not devolved needed a re-think, with Whitehall departments forced to give a clearer reason why some issues should not be handed over to Cardiff Bay.
Responding to the report on Monday, Mr Crabb said: "It's become clear to me that there are some areas of the bill where we need to make significant and substantial changes."
He said he would scrap the so-called "necessity test" which Welsh ministers would have had to consider before passing any laws.
The Welsh secretary said he would also limit the need for them to check permission with the UK government before passing certain laws - what Mr Jones had described as an "English veto".
It was "never the intention of this bill to increase constitutional red tape", Mr Crabb said.
A working group will also be set up to look at whether distinct arrangements are needed for Welsh law, without setting up a separate legal system to that shared with England.
The final version of the bill - due in February - will not be published until May at the earliest.
Monmouth MP David Davies, who chairs the Welsh Affairs Committee, welcomed the minister's response and decision to delay the bill as a "responsible step".
"He must use this additional time to reflect on the aspects of the draft bill that have caused controversy and come up with workable solutions," Mr Davies said.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said: "Let's be clear, this is an avoidable delay to clear up an avoidable mess.
"The UK Government need to get into the habit of treating Wales and the National Assembly for Wales with proper respect.
"We now have the opportunity, if the will is truly there, to repair the damage done by a flawed process and produce a genuinely meaningful piece of legislation."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood welcomed the removal of the necessity test and the plans to shorten the list of reserved powers, but was disappointed Mr Crabb "still refuses to acknowledge the need for Wales to have its own legal jurisdiction".
She claimed "inaction and lack of ambition by governments at both ends of the M4 have resulted in a flawed piece of legislation".
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: "A pause in this process is the right decision."
She said the draft bill "was seriously flawed and not in any fit state to move forward".
Assembly presiding officer Dame Rosemary Butler said a delay was right for the assembly and the UK government "to forge together a lasting constitutional settlement for Wales".
She urged UK ministers to use the time "constructively" to deliver "a clear, workable settlement that does not roll back on the powers already devolved to Wales".

article The actor was best known for appearing in Last of the Summer Wine and was also famous as the voice of Wallace in Wallace and Gromit.
His agent confirmed he died peacefully with his family by his side.
Sallis played Norman "Cleggy" Clegg in Last of the Summer Wine from its first episode in 1973 until the series concluded in 2010.
He was the only actor to appear in all 295 episodes of the sitcom.
Peter Sallis was best known as the mild-mannered Norman Clegg in Last of the Summer Wine.
By the time he first appeared in the role he had already carved out a distinguished career in the theatre and on television.
His role as the flat-capped philosopher made him the longest-serving cast member of the much-loved series.
And he reached an even wider audience as the voice of Wallace, the cheese-loving character in the animated Wallace and Gromit films.

Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park led tributes to Sallis, describing him as a "unique character".
"I'm so sad, but feel so grateful and privileged to have known and worked with Peter over so many years. He was always my first and only choice for Wallace," Park said in a statement.
Listen: Peter Sallis on Desert Island Discs
"Working with him was always a delight and I will miss his wry, unpredictable humour and silliness - that started the moment he greeted you at the door, and didn't stop when the mic was switched off."
Park added: "Peter had naturally funny bones and was a great storyteller and raconteur off stage too and would keep us amused for hours."
Shane Allen, BBC controller of comedy commissioning, said Sallis would be "fondly remembered for having the most distinctive and well-loved voice in animation".
Tony Hall, director general of the BBC, said: "Peter Sallis featured in many of the BBC's most popular programmes.
"He was a marvellous actor - who could forget that remarkable voice?
"Peter will be greatly missed by his many fans. Our thoughts are with his family and friends."
Paddy McGuinness paid tribute to the actor on Twitter, writing: "RIP the great Peter Sallis. #CrackingToast" - the hashtag a reference to one of Wallace's catchphrases.
Allo Allo actress Vicki Michelle tweeted: "Sad to hear about Peter Sallis. Fabulous actor loved by the nation... Somehow ageless, a lovely man."
In a statement, Jonathan Altaras Associates said: "It is with sadness that we announce that our client Peter Sallis died peacefully, with his family by his side, at Denville Hall on Friday 2 June."
Denville Hall is a retirement home for actors, and is also where Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs died last year.
As other actors came and went in Last of the Summer Wine, Sallis remained one of the programme's stalwarts as Cleggy, alongside Bill Owen as Compo and Brian Wilde as Foggy Dewhurst.
The Wallace and Gromit films won three Oscars and Sallis often spoke about how glad he was to have such success late in life.
"It is pleasing knowing millions are going to see your work and enjoy it," he said. "To still be involved in a project like this at my age is heartwarming.
"To have a legacy like this is very comforting. I am very lucky to have been involved."

article Brazil international Jesus agreed a five-year deal with City in August.
He stayed with Palmeiras until the end of the Brazilian season in December.
"He has the potential to become one of the best attacking players in the game," said City's director of football Txiki Begiristain.
Jesus arrived at City at the start of the month but registration to play for his new club was reportedly delayed while the Football Association examined documents relating to his move.
City regard the player as the best young talent in South America and fought off interest from Barcelona.
Jesus was voted the best newcomer in the Brazilian top flight last season and was part of his country's squad at the Rio Olympics.
The teenager said City boss Pep Guardiola was a huge influence in his decision to join.
Jesus added: "City is a club that always competes for the title in the competitions it enters, so that was an important factor, and because of the manager, Guardiola, and the squad."
City are fifth in the Premier League table, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, after two defeats in the last three games.
Jesus was known as Gabriel Fernando when he made his senior debut for Palmeiras at the age of 17.
A City statement said: "Known then as Gabriel Fernando, he was given the No 33 shirt - the age of Christ - and a shrewd Palmeiras press officer encouraged him to take the name Gabriel Jesus.
"He was handed his senior debut by Oswaldo de Oliveira on 7 March 2015, coming on in the 73rd minute of a 1-0 win over CA Bragantino at Allianz Parque."

article The measures include minimum eight-year sentences for fatal one-punch assaults influenced by drugs or alcohol.
Liquor shops will close earlier and premises in parts of Sydney will have to stop serving drinks by 03:00.
The move comes after the death of an 18-year-old who was attacked in Sydney.
Campaigners called for measures tackling alcohol-fuelled violence after Daniel Christie died after being punched in Sydney's King's Cross area on New Year's Eve.
Another 18-year-old, Thomas Kelly, died after being punched in 2012.
Single-punch attacks have been described colloquially as "king hits". However, campaigners and families of victims have called for them to be referred to as "coward punches" instead.
In a statement, NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell said: "I have been horrified by the continued drug and alcohol-fuelled attacks on city streets and the increase in violence used in these attacks."
"The idea that it's OK to go out, get intoxicated, start a fight or throw a coward's punch is completely unacceptable."
"I expect opposition to some or all of the measures," he said. "These new measures are tough and for that I make no apologies."
The measures also include lockouts in parts of Sydney's central business district, where people will be prevented from entering venues after 01:30, and the introduction of a state-wide 10pm closing time for liquor stores.
Similar lockout laws are in place in NSW's Newcastle area, and South Australia.
Supporters say the laws have been successful in reducing alcohol-related violence, but some venue owners say the measures have hurt businesses and that other measures, such as increased policing, are more effective.
Thomas Kelly's parents said they welcomed the measures, which had gone "way above what we were asking for".
"It's bittersweet to know that the reform will come in shortly but it's also still terrible for us as a family," they said.
Thomas Kelly's attacker, Kieran Loveridge, was given a minimum four year sentence in November. Campaigners described the sentence as too lenient.

article In some hotels featured by the Fifa-appointed agency Match, room rates will be up to five times higher during the tournament, a recent study suggests.
The board fears that "stratospheric" costs could damage the country's image.
The World Cup opening match will be on 12 June 2014, in Sao Paulo.
The board, known as Embratur, said that Match should change its policy of blocking hotel rooms and also called upon the agency to reduce its mark-up rates.
"We propose that the companies involved conduct new rounds of negotiations to lead to a restructuring of the prices,'' the board was quoted as saying in a document by the Associated Press news agency.
The board claimed: "Fifa/Match charges mark-up rates of more than 40% on the amount contracted with the hotel, something that contributes decisively to the increase of the already high rates."
However, Match said that it does not regulate room rates and that prices are set "by the hotel owners and other tourism stakeholders".
"As of yet it is totally unclear to Match Services on what criteria Embratur has been comparing rates as we have not been consulted in this matter," AP quoted the agency as saying.
It added that if hotels lowered their rates if would "readily pass the benefit of any such reduction to its customers".
The World Cup is one of the most popular sporting events and is expected to attract a large number of tourists to the host country.
According to Fifa, the 2006 World Cup held in Germany was attended by more than 3.3 million fans - with many of them flying in from all across the world.
Fifa is expecting a similar demand for the 2014 World Cup.
Brazil's tourism board said that it was concerned that if fans coming from outside the country had to pay excessive prices, it might hurt the country in the long run.
"We want to guarantee economic success and a legacy for the country that goes beyond the 2014 World Cup,'' it said.
In June, there were widespread protests in Brazil where the high cost of preparations for the World Cup was among the issues raised.

article A curate at St Eugene's Cathedral in Londonderry's Bogside, he attended the civil rights march in his capacity as parish priest, but instead became irrevocably linked to what was one of the darkest days of the Troubles.
He went on to become bishop of Derry and during nearly 20 years in the post, worked tirelessly to promote peace.
Bishop Daly gave evidence to both the Widgery and Saville inquiries into the events of 30 January 1972 and when the Saville Report was published in June 2010 he spoke of his "enormous relief" that the "burden has been lifted off my shoulders".
"I said on Bloody Sunday that those people were murdered, and a lot of people didn't believe that at the time, but I think all will believe it now," he said.
Edward Daly was born in Ballyshannon in County Donegal on 5 December 1933, and grew up in the border village of Belleek, in County Fermanagh.
He came to Derry as a teenage boarder at St Columb's College, then went to Rome to study for the priesthood at the Irish College.
His first parish was in Castlederg in County Tyrone, and he moved to St Eugene's Cathedral in 1962.
Bishop Daly's chief responsibility was always to his parishioners, but as a priest in the Bogside in the 1960s, it was inevitable that he would have first-hand experience of many of the tragedies of the Troubles.
His priority was always the victims, and he made clear that he was "a religious and moral leader, not a political one".
It was in that capacity that he attended the civil rights march in Derry in January 1972.
Thirteen civilians were shot dead by members of the British Parachute Regiment on what would become known as Bloody Sunday. Another victim died later from his injuries.
Fr Daly was standing near 17-year-old Jackie Duddy when he was shot.
"I went in front with this handkerchief in my hand and they carried Jackie behind me.
"We were very nervous and frightened and when we laid him down on the pavement he had died," he said.
The television footage made Fr Daly recognisable around the world, but he was uncomfortable with his fame.
"It changed my life completely.  I lost my anonymity," he said. "I think all the other things I did were forgotten.
"I was involved a lot in the ministry of people in that area, and theatre work, and everything else took second place.
"I was the priest with the handkerchief and that was it," he said.
Later the Duddy family gave him a photograph of Jackie, which he always kept on his desk.
In an BBC interview that day, he was adamant that the marchers had been unarmed.
"There was nothing fired at them, I can say that with absolute certainty because I was there."
He repeated this to the Widgery Tribunal, and, controversially, said he had seen a civilian gunman on Bloody Sunday.
"That didn't exactly make you the most popular person in town.  People would have preferred to forget about that," Fr Daly said.
In 1973, he left Derry to work as a religious advisor to RTE in Dublin, and the year after returned to Derry as bishop.
At just over 40, he was the youngest bishop in Ireland, but said he was "quite certain" he would not have received the appointment without Bloody Sunday.
As the city's bishop for almost 20 years, he worked to bring the different churches, and their parishioners, together.
He was unafraid to speak out against violence, and introduced a ban on paramilitary trappings at funerals.
In November 1976, Fr Daly helped organise a protest in response to a spate of sectarian murders.
"Virtually every clergyman in Derry city, and led by the two bishops, walked in silent procession across the city from Altnagelvin Hospital to the City Cemetery.
"It was the first time that the clergy of the city had made such a statement, such a witness, together," he said.
In 1980, James Mehaffey became the Church of Ireland bishop of Derry and Raphoe, and the two formed a close friendship.
They were both founders of the Waterside Churches Trust, as well as founder trustees of the Inner City Trust, designed to inject commercial and social life into the city centre after a decade of bombing.
A stroke forced him to retire as bishop in 1993, and he began ministering at the Foyle Hospice.
He celebrated Mass every Sunday, as well as looking after the spiritual needs of the terminally ill and their family and friends, and described his work there as "an immense privilege".
Bishop Daly was in the Guildhall on 15 June 2010 to hear what he knew to be the truth - that the marchers had been unarmed - acknowledged to the world.
"It was a very emotional afternoon, and I felt a sense of uncommon relief that this burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and the shoulders of the people in this city," he said.
"It's wonderful when the truth emerges, when people whose characters have been sullied are vindicated.
"It was good to have lived to witness this unforgettable day."
'Grave injustice'
The same year, he criticised the Police Ombudsman's report into the 1972 Claudy bombings, saying he had difficulty accepting his conclusions that a priest was involved in an atrocity which killed nine people.
Bishop Daly said he had interviewed Fr James Chesney in the 1970s, and had been told he was only a "verbal republican".
"There was no intimation he was actively involved," he said.
But he also spoke of his sympathy with the victims of Claudy, and said he believed it was a grave injustice to them that Fr Chesney had not been arrested.
In 2011, he called for a change to the law on clerical celibacy, saying there needed to be a place in the modern Catholic church for a married priesthood.
Around the world, Bishop Daly will be remembered as "the priest with the white handkerchief" who became one of the symbols of Bloody Sunday.
In Derry, his legacy will be as a man of peace who was the constant champion of the people he served.

article Hythe Ferry runs between the Hampshire market town, across Southampton Water to the city's Town Quay.
The operators said they issued staff with a letter warning of possible redundancies on Tuesday.
The company has not given any further details but said it was holding talks with other operators.
In a statement, Hythe Ferry Ltd said "everything should remain normal whilst talks with other operators and avenues are investigated".
"All avenues are being explored," it added.
Councillor Malcolm Wade, of Hampshire County Council - which currently subsidises the service, said he understood that the authority would continue  financial support "to either the current owners or any new owner to ensure this vital service keeps running".
"Local residents are deeply concerned, not just those commuting to Southampton but also business coming in," he said.
"It is important for the economy and also in terms of its historical significance. There has been a ferry service at Hythe for as long as I can remember and it's important we retain this service."
Following a request from Mr Wade, Hythe and Dibden Parish Council said it was looking to speak to the ferry provider "to see what help they would welcome at this time".
It added the issue would also be discussed at the next council meeting on 26 October.
Hampshire County Council has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.

article The latest blast took place at an apartment block at 08:00 local time (00:00 GMT) in Liucheng county, said state media.
Seventeen separate parcel explosions hit Liucheng on Wednesday.
A man suspected of having built the bombs - 33-year-old Wei Yinyong - died in one of the blasts, media said.
Earlier reports said a suspect had been arrested.
The cause for Thursday's blast was not clear, and no casualties have been reported. It is also not known if the blast is connected to the multiple explosions on Wednesday.
Thursday's explosion took place at a six-storey building in a residential area. Xinhua news agency said the force of the blast had caused debris to rain down on a road opposite the building.
Local police issued a statement calling on the public to be wary of accepting parcels sent by strangers or packages "sent by non-proper channels".
The local postal service has halted all deliveries until Saturday.
The parcel bombs on Wednesday targeted a prison, a railway station, a hospital and a shopping centre among other locations.
State media said 51 people were injured in the afternoon's blasts.
A video reportedly of one of Wednesday's blasts taken from a street surveillance camera has since emerged, showing a person being catapulted out of a shop as a bomb goes off inside. Another person walking down the street past the shop is knocked to the ground by the powerful blast.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing says there have been a number of cases in China of disaffected people with a legal grievance against the authorities using explosive devices in public attacks.

article Aldi's sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in the 12 weeks to 29 January, taking its market share to 6.2% and ahead of the Co-op's 6%, according to research firm Kantar Worldpanel.
It underlines the challenge the big retailers have faced from discounters such as Aldi and its German rival Lidl.
Sales at Lidl rose 9.4%, taking its market share to 4.5%.
"Underpinned by an extensive programme of store openings, the past quarter has seen Aldi attract 826,000 more shoppers than during the same period last year," said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel.
Ten years ago ago Aldi was only Britain's 10th largest food retailer, accounting for less than 2% of the grocery market.
Despite being overtaken by Aldi, Co-op's 2% sales increase was well ahead of the market, continuing a run of growth stretching back to July 2015.
Mr McKevitt said: "A significant own label sales increase of 7% was behind [Co-op's] strong performance, with healthier ranges successfully catering to consumers' good intentions for the new year."
Tesco remains the clear leader with more than 28% of the UK market. Its sales rose 0.3% over the 12-week period, which included the busy Christmas season.
Aldi will open its 700th store later this month and is planning to open a further 300 over the next five years.
Along with Lidl, it has caused huge disruption in the supermarket aisles, stealing market share form the traditional "big four" grocers.
But they've been fighting back so the discounters are having less of an easy ride these days. Aldi's growth, whilst still impressive, is slowing.
And the more it tries to offer its customers, in terms of range and in store experience, the greater the danger that it strays from its low cost, efficient business model which has proved so effective.
Morrisons, the smallest of the "big four", increased sales by 1.9%, gaining market share for the first time since June 2015.
Sales were flat at second-ranked Sainsbury's, but fell 1.9% at Asda, owned by US giant Wal-Mart.
Overall, supermarket sales were up 1.7% year on year, Kantar said.
The market researcher noted that well-publicised supply issues due to poor weather in southern Europe had affected sales of fresh produce.
Mr McKevitt said: "Eleven million households buy courgettes annually, but supply issues contributed to 759,000 fewer shoppers buying them this January - that's a 31% drop in spending compared with the same month last year.
"Sales of spinach also fell by 12%, in a clear sign that the poor weather in southern Europe has had a tangible impact on British shopping baskets."
Kantar said rising prices continued into the new year, with inflation on a basket of everyday groceries climbing to 0.7%.
"If prices continue to rise at the same rate for the rest of 2017, shoppers will find themselves around Â£27 worse off," Mr McKevitt said.

article A disciplinary meeting of the far-right party's executive was called after Mr Le Pen repeated his view that the Holocaust was "a detail of history".
His role as honorary president of the party will now be under review, the party said in a statement.
Mr Le Pen founded the National Front (FN) in 1972 and led it until 2011.
He refused to appear before the board, telling reporters he had been "disowned" by his political family.
Before the hearing, Marine Le Pen said her father should "no longer be able to speak in the name of the National Front".
Mr Le Pen told far-right newspaper Rivarol last month that he had never considered France's wartime collaborationist leader Philippe Petain a traitor and labelled Prime Minister Manuel Valls an immigrant.
His daughter has been trying to steer the party away from its racist and anti-Semitic past.
This was the response being pushed for by the Young Turks of the FN,  the group around Marine Le Pen who for a long time have urged a showdown with her father.
Their view - and hers too - is that the party's growth is being held back by memories of what it used to be, and that to move to the next level it must cut itself free from its past.
There are risks. Le Pen pere will be a nuisance till his last dying breath. The old guard will grumble.  Marine Le Pen's enemies will say nothing really has changed.
But the potential dividends are enormous. Marine Le Pen is showing herself every bit as stubborn and determined as her father. The irony is that he is the victim.
Mr Le Pen has been suspended but not dismissed by the party. An extraordinary party congress is expected to be held within three months aimed at ending the function of honorary president.
Some commentators have suggested he could be more of a risk outside of the party than if he were contained within it.
Mr Le Pen still holds a seat in the European Parliament and continues his post as regional councillor in the south of France.

article A website that asked people where the Canadian singer Justin Bieber should tour next finally received 650,000 votes to send him to North Korea.
A spokesperson for UMG told BBC News that it was a "hoax" but declined to give any further comment.
The poll was promoted by members of the imageboard website 4chan, urging their users to vote for North Korea.
The joke eventually turned viral, spreading onto Facebook and Twitter, with tens of thousands of people casting their vote on the site.
4chan has a long history of pulling off internet pranks and stunts.
In early July, Justin Bieber videos on YouTube were the target for internet hackers, redirecting users to adult websites or triggering pop-up messages saying that the Canadian singer had died in a car crash.
Google temporarily suspended commenting on videos and issued a statement saying: "We took swift action to fix a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."

article The men - arrested at about 19:10 BST on Sunday - are being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
Searches are continuing at six addresses and on two vehicles.
Whitehall officials said the alleged Jihadist plot was "serious" and intended to use firearms in the UK.
But they said it did not appear to be on anything like the scale of earlier major plots, such as the airline liquid bomb plot or the Birmingham rucksack bomb plot, which resulted in convictions.
The men were taken to a south London police station.
Two men, both aged 25, were arrested in a car in Mansell Street, Whitechapel, east London, after police fired "Hatton rounds" - ammunition designed to blow out tyres and blow open doors.
One was a British national of Turkish origin and the second was a British national of Algerian origin, police said.
A 28-year-old British national of Azerbaijani origin was arrested at premises in Westbourne Grove, Bayswater, west London, and the fourth man, a British national of Pakistani origin, aged 29, was arrested in Peckham Hill Street, Peckham, south-east London.
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said the decision to make arrests was taken on Sunday by a joint committee of senior officers from MI5 and the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command.
As always, they faced a dilemma over whether to hold off longer to gather more potential evidence, while running the risk that the public might be in danger, our correspondent said.
The alleged plot had been monitored for some time, he added.
He also said the four men must either be charged or released within 48 hours unless a magistrate grants a warrant to extend their detention for up to two weeks.
George Paul, who saw the Bayswater arrest, said it had been "very dramatic, like the movies".
"What I saw was three policemen... holding an individual down while he was shouting 'please don't break my arms' or something of that ilk," he told BBC News.
"They were basically trying to restrain him with another few officers ushering people away from the area."
And Ramin Massodi, who watched the arrest from inside the Persian restaurant where he works, said:  "I heard shouting; then I looked outside and saw four cars and they grabbed him."
He said police officers pushed the suspect up against the glass of the restaurant.
Alistair Gillies, 38, who saw the same arrest, told BBC News he estimated there had been about two dozen officers involved.
"The majority of them appeared to be plain clothes but they had on baseball caps with the checkerboard and police marking. Apart from that, they were dressed in plain clothes," he said.
"It looked like there was a great deal of planning and a great deal of resources had been put on to tackling this situation."
Meanwhile, City of London council member John Fletcher, whose apartment backs on to Whitechapel's Mansell Street, said he initially heard two loud bangs which he believed to be fireworks.
He said it was only when he went to investigate that he realised the seriousness of the situation.
"[A policeman] said: 'You'll hear all about it in the papers tomorrow'," he said.
Neighbour Catherine Delgado, 43, who saw the incident, said about "five or six" cars surrounded one vehicle, blocking off the street in the process.
She said police shouted at the driver to get out of the vehicle, but when she looked he was refusing.

article Terry, 36, has made just eight appearances for Chelsea this season, and has been linked with a move from the club he has played for since 1997.
Terry was sent off in his most recent appearance, the 4-1 FA Cup third-round victory over Peterborough United.
"For me the best player not currently playing in his team in the Premier League is John Terry," James said.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Sport, he added: "Whether John would consider a move on loan to somewhere like Swansea, I don't know.
"If you don't ask the question, you don't get the answer. If you're [Swansea boss] Paul Clement with his connection to Chelsea, I don't think it's an unrealistic question for him to ask."
The Swans have conceded 51 goals in the Premier League this season - more than any team - and James says Terry could be a good influence.
"A centre-back would be ideal. I've been very impressed with young Alfie Mawson since he came to the club," he added.
"Like most young players, he needs a bit of a knowledgeable tutor to play alongside him and to teach him the rudiments of Premier League football."
James scored 27 goals in 98 appearances for the Swans between 1980 and 1983.

article It follows concerns changes proposed by the UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) could undermine the "scores on doors" scheme in Wales.
In November 2013, Wales became the first UK nation to require food outlets to display their inspection ratings.
The FSA is considering allowing third party auditors to be brought in to make much more limited inspections of premises.
Senior officers in Wales are concerned the changes are fuelled by a need for councils in England to make savings - something the FSA has denied - and believe they would undermine the improvements in Wales.
Mark Elliott, from the Directors of Public Protection in Wales, said: "We should in Wales really consider a Wales-specific solution now, to build on what we've done, and not mess up what we've already got."
The FSA said the proposed new system would give a better picture about a premises' standards every day - rather than just on the day they are inspected - by taking their own audits and systems into account.
It has also been suggested food businesses should have to pay for a licence before they could open.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We will continue to collaborate with the FSA and local authorities to develop a sustainable approach to food business regulation that works across Wales and which reflects the need to ensure that the highest standards of food hygiene and safety are maintained."

article Andrew Conway and Ronan O'Mahony scored two tries apiece, with Robin Copeland, Darren O'Shea and Alex Wootton also crossing for the Irish province.
Tyler Bleyendaal kicked a penalty and three conversions for Munster, with Ian Keatley also adding a conversion.
Ian McKinley's early penalty proved to be Treviso's only score of the match.
With man-of-the-match Bleyendaal pulling the strings from fly-half in freezing temperatures, Munster led 22-3 at half-time.
The hosts took a while to settle, former Leinster fly-half McKinley booting Treviso into an eighth-minute lead before Bleyendaal responded on the quarter-hour mark.
A terrific five-metre scrum saw Munster march Treviso back over their line for number eight Copeland to touch down in the 20th minute, with Bleyendaal converting for 10-3.
The New Zealander increased his influence with a well-weighted chip through, O'Mahony raced up to pressurise the Treviso cover and the onrushing Conway pounced on the loose ball for an unconverted try.
Darren Sweetnam did well to thwart Michael Tagicakibau from McKinley's dangerous cross-field kick, before Munster extended their lead to 19 points with a brilliantly worked 34th-minute try from inside their own half.
Bleyendaal's deft kick pass found O'Mahony, at full tilt, and he did well to link with the supporting Conway who sped along the left touchline for a classy seven-pointer.
O'Shea's first Pro12 try, barely two minutes after the restart, saw him charge onto a Bleyendaal pass and he proved unstoppable from close range. The Kiwi threaded the difficult conversion through the posts for good measure.
Without a large number of players through international call-ups and injuries, Treviso continued to struggle at set-piece time and could not penetrate a solid Munster defence, which was typified by young debutant centre Sam Arnold.
The game lulled along with Munster guilty of poor discipline, before O'Mahony made it over in the corner in the 64th minute after an initial maul had been held up.
Wootton made an immediate impact off the bench, and the Ireland Sevens international rounded his man for the second time to notch a deserved try, converted by Ian Keatley.
Munster could have had a couple more scores late on, but they did register a seventh of the afternoon when Copeland used lineout ball to break to the blindside and feed O'Mahony for another crisp finish.

article Knights announced their closure on 21 July because of financial difficulties, but Guildford said Dickenson will take over a "virtually debt-free" club.
Dickenson has since denied that a deal to take ownership is imminent.
"The deal now just needs the legal formalities completing and RFL approval, which should be completed in the next few days," Guildford said.
"York City Knights will be passed over virtually debt-free with the funding I have provided in the form of director's loans on the balance sheet not required to be repaid.
"That is my gift to professional rugby league in York to give somebody else the chance to take the club forward with the best possible start."
Dickenson has previously been part of the York City Knights board of directors, but stepped down as a result of disputes between other board members.
"The intentions are there and the will's there, and a lot of people are trying to back this and push it through, but there's a lot of diligence to be done," he told BBC Radio York.
"The word 'virtually' is a very relative word. Is 'virtually' £5,000 of debt, or £150,000 of debt?"

article Prosecutors say the men conspired to pay officials from 2002-11, including police, prison officers and soldiers.
They are accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, celebrities and prison inmates.
The six men, who deny all the charges, include the Sun's news editor, picture editor and ex-managing editor.
All six members of staff are charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.
The Sun's head of news Chris Pharo faces six charges, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and ex-Sun deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll are accused of four charges each.
Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards are charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup is accused of two counts.
Opening the prosecution's case at Kingston Crown Court in south-west London, Peter Wright QC described the payments as "craven conduct motivated by greed on the part of the public servants who had information to sell".
"This trial is about a series of corrupt agreements between staff and journalists at the Sun newspaper on the one hand, and various public officials on the other," he said.
"We say this was craven conduct directed by the greed on the part of the public servants that they could sell information, and journalists and management at the Sun were prepared to pay for it."
He said at "no point" did staff and journalists alleged to have been involved in the illegal payments express concern that the law was being broken.
The men plotted together as part of an "over-arching" plan and also separately in "sub-conspiracies", he said.
Their motivation "was not public interest but profit" and "in order to further their own agenda", Mr Wright added.
"The principal interest, we say, of the journalists and staff at the Sun, we say, was good copy," he told the jury.
"Newsworthiness - 'splashes' as they are called in the trade - and exclusives."
Mr Wight told the jury the alleged payments began in 2000, when a former Surrey Police officer told Sun reporter Mr Pyatt that Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall had been arrested over an allegation of rape.
The allegation was dropped a day later but - having received the tip-off - Mr Pyatt then cultivated him as a paid source, Mr Wright said.
The court also heard, in May 2009, the same officer leaked a story about Dane Bowers, the singer and former boyfriend of glamour model Katie Price, also known as Jordan.
Mr Pyatt is accused of telling Mr Pharo in 2009: "He has been with me since the Mick Hucknall splash for rape and knows what a splash and spread exclusive on Jordan is worth."
Mr Wright said it showed the stories alleged to have been bought aimed to "titillate or amuse, as opposed to inform the public on matter of public interest".
News editor Mr Pharo is accused of authorising 34 payments for a total of about Â£21,000 between March 2002 and January 2011.
The payments included tip-offs to a soldier posted at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst while Prince William and Prince Harry attended the college and a healthcare assistant at Broadmoor Special Hospital who worked with criminals such as Peter Sutcliffe, known as the Yorkshire Ripper.
Mr Pharo is also said to have approved payments a former Metropolitan Police officer and a prison officer at HMP Swaleside.
The prosecution also detailed telephone contacts between district reporter Mr Pyatt and a Surrey Police officer, Simon Quinn, in March 2009.
Mr Wright told the jury the phone contact coincided with the officer accessing a police computer system and looking for details about the arrest of TV personality Chris Tarrant, who had been held by police a few days earlier on suspicion of assault.
He also referred to another Sun headline from a April 2009 story in the newspaper about a couple caught by police having sex on the lawn at Windsor Castle.
He showed the jury emails from Mr Pyatt and his managers suggesting the story had come from a Thames Valley Police officer who had been paid Â£1,500 for the information.
Mr Pharo, 45, of Sandhurst, Berkshire; Mr Pyatt, 51, of Windsor, Berkshire; Mr O'Driscoll, 38, also of Windsor, Berkshire; Mr Edwards, 50, of Brentwood, Essex; Mr Dudman, 51, also of Brentwood, Essex; and Mr Troup, 49, of Saffron Walden, Essex, deny the charges against them.

article The US boaters were part of the Port Huron Float Down, an annual event on the St. Clair River, which divides the US state of Michigan and Canada.
Police in Sarnia, Ontario, said it took hours to transport the stranded revellers back to the US on Sunday.
No arrests were made and no one was injured, according to police.
The unsanctioned event - in which participants float down the river on rafts, inner tubes and other flotation devices - begins at Port Huron's Lighthouse Beach in Michigan and was supposed to end at Chrysler Beach in Marysville.
But hundreds of people were not prepared for the strong winds and challenging weather conditions, which blew about 1,500 people out of American waters and over the border.
Sarnia Police Service Staff Sgt Scott Clarke told the Times Herald newspaper that participants "were unprepared to be stranded anywhere," adding that many were not equipped with life jackets.
"It was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it," Mr Clarke said. "There were long waits and long lines. They were cold and wet, but they all made it home."
Canadian officials spent six hours and took 19 bus loads of people back to US Customs and Border Protection.
Sarnia city spokeswoman Katarina Ovens said workers spent several hours cleaning up after the invasion, picking up beer cans, coolers and even picnic tables that had washed up on the shore.
The US Coast Guard has attempted to work with Port Huron officials to sanction the event, but no sponsors have taken responsibility for the annual float, according to US Coast Guard Lt Ben Chamberlain.
St Clair County Sheriff Deputy Steve Campau said all participants were accounted for as of Monday morning.

article Google has filed a patent suggesting users stick out their tongue or wrinkle their nose in place of a password.
It says requiring specific gestures could prevent the existing Face Unlock facility being fooled by photos.
The Jelly Bean version of Android introduced the need for users to blink their eyes as a check, but users soon demonstrated it could be fooled.
A spokesman for Google was unable to comment on when the suggested technology might be implemented.
The document - which was filed in June 2012 but has only just been published - suggests the software could track a "facial landmark" to confirm a user not only looks like the device's owner but also carries out the right action.
It says examples of the requests that might be made include:
It says the check would work by comparing two images taken from a captured video stream of the user's face to see if the difference between them showed the gesture had been made.
The filing also notes several ways the software might check that the device was being shown a real person's face rather than doctored photographs.
These include studying other frames from the captured video stream to check that the person had made a sequence of movements to achieve the commanded gesture, and confirming all of the frames actually showed the person's face.
In addition it says the software could monitor if there were changes in the angle of the person's face to ensure the device was not being shown a still image with a fake gesture animated on top.
Such efforts might help address criticism that its current face detection software is insecure.
Last year Google introduced a "liveness check", requiring users to blink at their device to prevent its facial recognition program being fooled by a photograph.
However, a group of security researchers from the University of British Columbia posted a video online showing the feature could still be tricked.
They showed that an image of one of their members could be copied from Facebook, then - using graphics editing software - treated so that his eyes were painted over with colours matching his skin tone, and fake eyelashes were drawn on top to make it appear that he had his eyes shut.
By holding a screen up to the targeted Android device and flicking back-and-forth between the original and doctored images, they showed Android was fooled into believing it was being shown the subject blinking.
The latest patent says the additional checks should prevent such a spoof working, adding that a combination of specific gestures - such as a request for a blink followed by a half turn of their head and then a wink - could be issued at random to make it even harder to deceive the ID feature.
However, Google acknowledges even this might not be enough, envisaging a situation in which a device could be programmed to generate a video showing the user making the requested facial expressions.
To tackle this it says the device could also "emit light beams having different colours or frequencies, that are expected to induce in the eyes of a user a reflection of light having  a corresponding frequency content".
In other words, the software could use the device's screen and flash to shine different coloured light into the user's face and then check for related glints in their eyes as he or she made the requested facial gestures.
In the future it adds that a "3D-rangefinder" built into a phone or tablet might also use lasers to study the contours of the person's face as an additional check.
Despite all this, one cybersecurity expert said it might still be years before it became advisable to use facial recognition passwords.
"The problem with biometrics in the past has been that you have always been able to find a way to work round the requests to deliver what's needed," Prof Alan Woodward, chief technology officer at the consultancy Charteris, told the BBC.
"It sounds like Google is thinking about how try and counter this with randomness and movement.
"But there's a long way between writing a patent about an idea and delivering it as a reliable security measure. I would expect people will still use traditional passwords for some time to come."
A spokesman for Google said it did not discuss individual patents, but noted that it filed a variety of ideas that its employees came up with.
"Some of those ideas later mature into real products or services, some don't," he added.
"Prospective product announcements should not necessarily be inferred from our patent applications."

article Currently club's in England's top flight can spend £1.85m on their squad, with another £175,000 allowed for a marquee player outside of that.
Koukash called from an increase in the cap in 2013 when he bought Salford and hopes to discuss the matter at a Super League meeting this week.
"The cap is very, very restrictive," he told Rugby League Extra.
"The fact that it is the same as it was five years ago tells you something and it is restricting you - you can't even keep it with the rate of inflation.
"I'm not saying every owner or club is going to be able to do it but the fact that you're telling everybody to keep it below that level and the likes of [Leigh owner] Derek Beaumont, myself and [Warrington owner] Simon Moran - we've got the funds, we could go out and invest in trying to build stronger teams."
After only securing their Super League status with an golden-point drop-goal in the Million Pound Game against Hull KR last season, Salford are fourth after winning five of their first eight games in 2017.
It is the second full season for head coach Ian Watson after he replaced Iestyn Harris in 2015 and Koukash believes the 40-year-old former Red Devils scrum-half has made a difference.
"Ian is a fantastic coach and what makes him one is the fact he is a very, very nice person," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"A coach is a leader more than anything else and his players are his soldiers - if the soldiers trust in the leader they'll do their best, and that is what I think has made an awful lot of difference this year.

article Centre Hospitalier de Calais has bid to provide services to patients in the county, NHS commissioners said.
South Kent Coast Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said the "finer details" were being worked out.
People who chose to have treatment in France would pay for their own travel and incidental costs. Unison said it was an "admission of failure".
Hazel Carpenter, chief accountable officer for South Kent CCG, said treatment in France would be an option if a patient wanted it, in discussion with their GP.
She said commissioners recently invited organisations to provide general surgery, gynaecology, cataract surgery, pain management and orthopaedics to apply for the work, and two French providers applied as well as several English providers.
"We carried out a careful assessment of the services they offer and are visiting sites," she added.
"The two French providers, among others, fulfilled our criteria and we expect to finalise a contract with them."
Analysis: Mark Norman, BBC South East Today Health Correspondent
The devil is in the detail here. It seems a good idea to use spare capacity in France for NHS patients needing general surgery, but...
Both the French hospital and the NHS say Calais clinicians will share patient information with NHS GPs but the hospital director in Calais was unsure how that would work in practice
While the NHS has said post-operative checkups could be done in France or via Skype it remains to be seen if patients will be prepared to travel or use the technology available.
What happens if something goes wrong? - 24-hour access to the surgical team sounds great but will sick patients have to cross the Channel?
And it's the NHS who will have to pay for their care after a month.
Meanwhile, the East Kent Hospitals Trust, already in special measures and struggling financially, could now lose the income from up to 300 patient operations a year.
The French hospital hopes to see the first UK patients before Christmas and plans to treat between 300 and 400 NHS patients per annum.
Martin Trelcat, general manager of the Calais hospital, said it had been giving English classes to about 70 nurses and language would not be a barrier.
Simon Bolton, Unison spokesman, said it was "an admission of failure" by the NHS.
He said the CCG had failed to make sure the NHS could tackle waiting lists, which he said were lengthening because of government cuts.
Adding that patients wanted to be treated as quickly and as close to home as possible, he said: "The idea that this is some great consumer choice is frankly crazy."
Damian Collins, Folkestone and Hythe MP, said it was sensible to use a fantastic hospital that might be less than an hour away from some and more accessible than hospitals in London.
He said using Calais would help deal with NHS overcrowding and added: "If this deal hadn't been struck, I'm sure we'd have had people coming to us saying there's capacity in the hospital in Calais."
A spokeswoman for the NHS South East Commissioning Support Unit said the deal was not a waiting list initiative but rather about following EU competition rules which gave patients more choice.
She said French providers would operate like other NHS referrals where GPs would share patient information and also receive discharge and care plan details after the treatment.
French and English providers were bound by the Data Protection Act with regard to patient records, she added.
Providers would give patients 24-hour access to the surgical team for two weeks after treatment, and would pay for any readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge.
And follow-up checks after surgery could be done by phone or Skype or at another visit to the hospital, she said.
She said the cost and distances of choosing a London or French hospital were easily comparable.

article The Grade II listed York Theatre Royal closed in March 2015 and had planned to resume performances last December.
That date had to be put back after the foundations of the medieval St Leonard's Hospital were found intact beneath the main main auditorium.
The York Conservation Trust, which owns the theatre, said the scheme meant improved access and flexibility.
Its main stage has been reconstructed in a modular form, allowing it to be adapted or removed entirely, which means the venue is now more suitable for touring productions and dance companies.
It is the first significant change to the 270-year-old theatre since a concrete and glass extension was built in 1967.
The project was funded by the Arts Council England, City of York Council and York Conservation Trust with other grants and donations coming from corporate and individual supporters.
A public fundraising campaign also raised around £215,000 towards the costs of the redevelopment.

Slater said the incident was "like smashing my foot with a big hammer".
Writing on Instagram, he said he is likely to need between four and six months to recover.
In an earlier post, which included an X-ray of his foot, he wrote: "You ever folded your entire foot backwards? If you try it sometime, this is what it might look like.
"Sorta feels like I'm giving birth out of my foot right now.
"It sucks but so many people deal with such horrible things around this world every day that a broken foot is pretty minor in the scheme of things. Sometimes a bad thing is a good thing."
Meanwhile, Australia's Mick Fanning and Brazilian Gabriel Medina were pulled from the water in Jeffreys Bay after a shark was spotted swimming into the competition zone.
Fanning, 36, escaped a shark attack while competing in the same event two years ago.

article It was not yet clear what had been stolen from the house in Cape Town on Wednesday night, his aide Roger Friedman told the AFP news agency.
Archbishop Tutu had been in Johannesburg for the service.
There was also a break-in at the Tutu home in August.
South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world.
"I can confirm that there was a burglary last [Wednesday] night," Mr Friedman is quoted as saying.
"The house was not pillaged," he added.
Police said the burglary took place between 19:00 and 21:00 local time, the Associated Press news agency reports.
It is the second time that his home has been burgled. In August, a gang broke in when he and his wife were asleep and took a number of items.
Archbishop Tutu, 82, gave the closing prayer at the memorial, attended by tens of thousands of South Africans and world leaders.
"God, I ask you to bless our country," he said.
"You gave us a wonderful gift in this icon of reconciliation," he added, referring to Mr Mandela.
Archbishop Tutu won the Nobel Peace prize in 1984 for his role in campaigning for Mr Mandela's release from prison and an end to white minority rule in South Africa.
Mr Mandela was freed in 1990 and was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1993 along with South Africa's last white ruler, FW de Klerk.
Mr Mandela's body is lying in state at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where he was sworn in as South Africa's first democratic president in 1994.
His funeral is due to take place on Sunday in his rural home of Qunu in the Eastern Cape province following his death on Thursday at the age of 95.

article Parades in Edinburgh and Aberdeen were among 300 events taking place across the globe.
Veterans minister Keith Brown said those who had served in the armed forces were a "significant asset" to the country.
He said ministers were "working hard" to help veterans on issues such as healthcare, housing and education.
Mr Brown, who served in the Falklands conflict, attended the celebrations in Edinburgh.
He said: "Armed Forces Day is a chance for communities across Scotland to say thank you to our service personnel, veterans and their families for their service, commitment and courage.
"Veterans and their families are a significant asset to businesses and the recently set-up Strategic Group will focus efforts on boosting their career opportunities once they leave the armed forces.
"I am pleased that this group, chaired by Mark Bibbey of Poppyscotland, is getting to grips with this agenda and look forward to seeing it drive forward action in coming months."
Serving members of the forces and veterans marched to Edinburgh City Chambers on the Royal Mile, where earlier this week the Armed Forces Day flag was raised.
Lord Provost Frank Ross said: "This city has a long and proud tradition of supporting the armed forces and our veterans.
"Holding a day in their honour provides us with an opportunity to do all we can to thank them for all they do to keep us safe."
In Aberdeen, Vice Lord-Lieutenant Andrew Lawtie took the salute as the parade passed the city's Town House,
He said: "Aberdeen always embraces this opportunity to say thank you to personnel for their service to the country by turning out in large numbers to watch the parade.
"It's heart-warming to see spectators young and old pay tribute to the British armed forces community for their hard work, dedication and efforts to keep us safe in the UK and across the globe.
"The pipe bands, marching personnel and military vehicles fill the length of Union Street, creating quite a moving spectacle."

article The above words come from a narco-corrido, a musical homage to Mexico's wealthiest drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' or 'Shorty' Guzman.
Sung at local fiestas in his birthplace of Badiraguato in the western state of Sinaloa, the lyrics sum up the strange mixture of admiration, fear and respect which many in that mountainous region have for the world's most wanted drug trafficker.
The stories about him are legion: his diminutive stature, his wealth, his women.
Worth an estimated $1bn (Â£630m), he featured annually Forbes rich list and was a fugitive from justice for more than 10 years.
Until this week, when his long flight from the authorities finally came to an end when he was arrested in his home state of Sinaloa.
In a country which has produced some of the most notorious drug lords,  Joaquin Guzman Loera stood out.
"I think 'El Chapo' has become the most iconic drug trafficker of modern times," says Ioan Grillo, author of El Narco, an in-depth examination of Mexico's drug cartels.
From his feet to his head, he is short,
But from his head up to the sky, I'd say,
He's the biggest of the big,
Who could possibly doubt it?
Sometimes in homes, sometimes in a country house,
With his radios and machine guns,
Sleeping on the floor, sometimes just a cave as his roof,
They call him Joaquin 'El Chapo'...
"Even more so than the biggest drug trafficker of the 1980s, Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who he once worked under. El Chapo went beyond that in the last six or seven years to become the most recognisable drug trafficker in the world and the most high profile warlord in the present conflict."
So what made this uneducated cattle rancher's son get so good at controlling the illicit flow of cocaine, heroin and marijuana into the United States?
The respected Mexican magazine Proceso recently described Guzman as "the capo who took most advantage of the globalised dynamic of drug trafficking".
Certainly, when first starting out in the drug-smuggling business in the late 1970s, he rose quickly through the ranks of the Guadalajara Cartel by reportedly pushing his bosses to let him handle greater volumes.
He has also been credited by several biographers with finding innovative ways to move the drugs north.
Internationally, too, he has always thought big.
Today, his sphere of influence is vast. His Sinaloa Cartel has tentacles in Europe, Asia and across Latin America.
But, says Ioan Grillo, it was not just a canny understanding of the processes of globalisation that made Guzman unique as a drug lord.
"Drug trafficking has always been a collective endeavour. It's not about just one guy smuggling all the drugs," he said.
"There are hundreds of individuals, thousands even, in the Sinaloa Cartel who have been very adept at tapping into the US drug market, bringing down the price of cocaine from the Colombians, moving into crystal meth (methamphetamine) to bolster the heroin and marijuana trade."
Mr Grillo argues that what set El Chapo apart was his pragmatism.
"His ability to rise to the top through the selective use of violence, to survive the extreme violence against him and all the while to create this huge mythology around him... it all made him something of a cult figure so that he is now recognised right across Latin America."
So much so, that drug groups in other countries have sought to tie themselves to his name and ally their organisations with his cartel, in the knowledge that his surnames, Guzman Loera, carry great weight in the criminal underworld.
He also commanded great loyalty, both among his foot-soldiers and the local communities in states such as Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua.
But Mr Grillo argues that the stories about Guzman can be misleading.
"Sometimes the myth takes over, and in fact he wasn't as all-powerful as he's been portrayed. For example he was never able to take (the state of) Tamaulipas in the north-east of Mexico and faced ongoing battles across the country from his rivals."
Of course, there is an important political dimension to Guzman's demise.
It is a huge boost for the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman has evaded arrest since he escaped from prison in 2001.
The removal of a figure like Guzman plays well both at home and in Washington.
However, many fear this may be the start of something much more bloody in Mexico, at least in the short term.
"Taking 'El Chapo' down will be extremely destabilising," says Mr Grillo.
"The pattern has been very clearly that when the big godfathers have been taken out, it's always created violence. Their lieutenants fight among themselves for control."
The signs for Mexico are ominous.
"This could be an earthquake in the drug smuggling industry in the areas of north-west Mexico and the Pacific coast. We could really see an eruption of violence with 'El Chapo' now out of the game," says Mr Grillo.

article He rose to prominence during a campaign against Belfast City Council's decision in December 2012 to limit the number of days the flag flies from the city hall.
The 24-year-old was also convicted of obstructing traffic during one of the demonstrations staged in Belfast.
Bryson, of Rosepark, Donaghadee, County Down, will be sentenced next month.
He had denied a series of charges linked to the loyalist street protests, claiming he was the victim of a political prosecution.
However, the judge at Belfast Magistrates' Court rejected claims that Bryson had only been present as an individual at the protests, and as such was unaware the events could have been illegal.
"The defendant's evidence lacked any real substance or credibility on any of the issues relevant to the case," she said.
"In my opinion he was at pains to try and misinterpret statements of senior police in order to attempt to pass responsibility for his actions to the police as opposed to accepting responsibility for his own actions."
The charges included four counts of participating in four un-notified public processions during January and February 2013, and obstructing traffic on the Newtownards Road in east Belfast.
In his evidence, Bryson said he did not know the protests could have been unlawful.
He accepted he had been filmed in CCTV footage of the marches, but said that on each occasion, he had walked to and from the centre of Belfast as an individual.
During the trial, prosecution counsel accused him of treating police with contempt when he was interviewed about the offences.
The court heard that the loyalist campaigner told officers he was an Irish republican and the first minister of Northern Ireland.
He also suggested to police that he was in a fictional gay relationship with fellow flag campaigner Willie Frazer, it was claimed.
In a highly unusual move, one of Northern Ireland's most senior police officers was called to give evidence as part of the defence case.
ACC Will Kerr told the court he agreed to meet Bryson and loyalist community representatives as part of efforts to ensure their weekly demonstrations did not break the law.
The officer also said he warned those at the meeting on 29 January, 2013 of the "criminal justice consequences" of taking part in un-notified public processions.
Delivering her verdict, the judge said Bryson was "closely involved in the arrangements regarding the protests".
"I do not accept his explanation that he did not know the status of the processions in question," she added.
Convicting him on all charges, Mrs Bagnall said CCTV footage of the protests showed Bryson standing with others in the middle of the road.
Bryson was released on continuing bail to return for sentencing in four weeks time.

article Red squirrels are one of Ireland's most iconic, native mammals, but numbers are in steep decline as bigger and more aggressive, non-native, grey squirrels invade their habitat and spread disease.
Cars also pose a major threat. More than 70 red squirrels have been killed by motorists in the last few years and many more injured.
The NISF, in partnership with red squirrel groups across Northern Ireland, is appealing to drivers to "slow your speed, save our red squirrels".
The forum is encouraging householders to do their part by displaying squirrel warning signs on outside bins to highlight the danger to passing traffic.
Daniel McAfee, chair of the Glens Red Squirrel Group, said: "Too many of Northern Ireland's red squirrels are victims of speeding cars.
"Because of the greys, they are now confined to small patches of woodland. When they try to migrate across roads and start new populations, increasing numbers are being killed by cars.
"If motorists slow down, they will give the squirrels a fighting chance."
Squirrel groups have identified several Northern Ireland accident 'black spots' where there are currently strong red squirrel populations.
Together with members of the NISF, and Ulster Wildlife, they have devised a way in which householders in these areas can do their bit.
Mr McAfee said: "We are not permitted to display permanent signs, but as wheelie bins are set on road edges at least once a week, the stickers are a great opportunity to get the message across.
"Hopefully, drivers in these areas will see the stickers and note that red squirrels may be crossing the roads in their area."
Roads and areas identified as a significant problem for red squirrels are:
County Antrim has the largest number of squirrel road deaths with 54 of the endangered mammals killed on its roads.
In County Fermanagh, there have been 10 reds killed and in the area surrounding Mount Stewart in County Down, there have been eight.
However, these are only the incidents the squirrel forum is aware of. The actual number of reds killed or injured by cars is likely to be much higher.
The Forestry Commission estimates that there are only 140,000 red squirrels left in the UK compared with more than 2.5 million greys. So the future of the red squirrel in Northern Ireland is under severe threat.
Grey squirrels were first introduced to the UK from North America in the late 19th century.
To obtain a bin sticker, contact your local red squirrel group or email: squirrels@doeni.gov.uk

article Mr Davutoglu is believed to have fallen from favour because he disapproved of Mr Erdogan's plans to move Turkey to a presidential system of government.
But in a speech, Mr Davutoglu pledged his loyalty to President Erdogan, saying he bore no anger against anyone.
His successor will be chosen when the congress meets on 22 May.
Leadership split spoils the party
Recep Tayyip Erdogan - Turkey's bruised battler
Earlier on Thursday, presidential aide Cemil Ertem said there would be no snap elections following the appointment of a new leader.
He also told Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilise further "when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdogan takes office".
When the end came, it was swift and brutal. Ahmet Davutoglu bowed out after crossing the man with the real power: President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Mr Davutoglu was expected to be a pliant prime minister but disagreed with some of Mr Erdogan's more controversial policies and crucially wavered in his support to change the constitution to boost the president's powers.
His resignation means Mr Erdogan tightens his control of Turkey and is likely to install a more obedient prime minister. It will worry many Western leaders who find the divisive Mr Erdogan difficult to handle.
And it plunges this crucial country into a political crisis amid security threats and rows over the clampdown on human rights and free speech. The message from President Erdogan to Mr Davutoglu's successor is clear: follow my lead or you'll face the same fate.

Mr Davutoglu met Mr Erdogan for nearly two hours on Wednesday but differences were clearly not resolved.
Mr Davutoglu said he would continue as a party legislator and would not try to divide the AKP.
"I feel no reproach, anger or resentment against anyone," he said.
"No-one heard, or will ever hear, a single word from my mouth, from my tongue or my mind against our president."
After he was elected president in 2014, Mr Erdogan hand-picked Mr Davutoglu to succeed him as head of the AK Party (Justice and Development Party).
But the prime minister's unease with Mr Erdogan's plans to move to a presidential system, among other policies, has been evident in recent months.
In a sign of his weakening influence, Mr Davutoglu was stripped last week of the authority to appoint provincial AK Party officials.
The development comes at a time of increasing instability for Turkey, which is tackling an escalating conflict with the rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), attacks by the so-called Islamic State, and an influx of migrants and refugees.
Turkey is also in the midst of implementing a key deal with the European Union, brokered by Mr Davutoglu, to limit the number of refugees flowing across its border in return for accelerated EU accession talks and financial aid.
The future of that agreement, which Mr Davutoglu was seen as having agreed with little input from the president, could be plunged into doubt by his departure.
Among those tipped as successors to Mr Davutoglu are Transport Minister Binali Yildirim, who is close to Mr Erdogan, and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is the president's son-in-law.
The leader will be formally elected at the party congress.
Main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said Mr Davutoglu had been forced from office through the "will of one person".
"Davutoglu's resignation should not be perceived as an internal party issue, all democracy supporters must resist this palace coup," he said.
The political uncertainty also rattled the financial markets. The Turkish lira suffered its heaviest daily loss on Wednesday, down almost 4% against the US dollar.
It rallied slightly on Thursday but was still well off its previous trading levels.

article The videos feature warnings of the harm done by viewing such images.
The Lucy Faithfull Foundation (LFF) said it was aimed to deter would-be offenders and encourage them to seek therapy before being arrested.
Viewing or sharing an image of someone under the age of 18 carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.
The NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command estimates there are more than 50,000 people in the UK who share and download obscene images of children.
Keith Bristow, the head of the National Crime Agency, previously admitted the scale of the problem meant it was not possible for all offenders to be brought to justice.
The new campaign has been set up by Stop it Now! UK & Ireland  - a child sexual abuse prevention campaign run by the LFF charity, which seeks to reduce the risk of children being sexually abused.
Donald Findlater, director of research and development for the LFF, said recent research indicated as many as 10% of those who look at child abuse images may go on to abuse a child.
He said: "The sooner we stop people viewing indecent images of children online, the fewer children will be abused."
One of those who viewed such images - who the BBC is calling Dave - was sentenced this year for possession of indecent images.
He said he had been "addicted" to adult pornography for years before he started looking for material including children.
"Through various pop-ups and so on, there would be school girl type images, and so on, and gradually more and more degrees which eventually led through to underage images".
"I do recall after very initially seeing any images that I was totally disgusted with myself for having done that - but at the same time I went back."
He was arrested last year, convicted, given a community sentence and placed on the sex offenders' register.
He also agreed to undergo therapy.
"I always suspected that one day there would be a knock at the door and when it came I was very petrified, but certainly as time has gone on there has been a huge sense of relief."
"I'm not a monster. I am just an ordinary person that you might just pass in the street."
The videos have been put together with help from the police and include comments from offenders - voiced by actors - who describe what a conviction did to their lives.
The videos also explain that the viewing of the images is not a victimless crime and highlight the harm done to children involved, as well as the consequences for the lives of people who access the images.
One shows officers knocking on the door of a man's home before his wife and child watch him being taken away in handcuffs.
Help is then offered through a confidential helpline run by the LFF, which can also organise group or individual therapy.
The videos are going to be rolled out across social media and through carefully placed online advertising.
There have been similar initiatives in Holland and Germany which have targeted men who admit to being sexually attracted to children.
Research published by the NSPCC in July this year revealed offenders are being convicted at the rate of two per day for possession of obscene images.
A study of 100 court cases found police had seized 4.5 million images of child sexual abuse.
Campaigners fear some of those those who look at the images may move on to abuse.
Dave who was convicted of possessing indecent images says he now feels, "a great sense of shame, guilt, remorse for my bad behaviours that I had".
His advice for other men and women in his position is simple.
"Get help before, before you're arrested, there is a path, there are a lot of very good people out there to help you, pick up the phone and start talking to someone".
"The best thing to do is to start to talk".
An NSPCC spokesman said it welcomed the efforts made to stop people viewing abuse images, but added: "But we mustn't forget there are thousands of young victims and similar efforts should be made to ensure they are identified, rescued and given protection and support."

article The now-former officers' trial collapsed in 2011.
The eight cleared are suing South Wales Police for misfeasance in public office and false imprisonment.
Chris Coutts, now retired, told the High Court in Cardiff he had not been "determined" to see them prosecuted.
Graham Mouncher, Thomas Page, Richard Powell, John Seaford, Michael Daniels, Peter Greenwood, Paul Jennings and Paul Stephen are suing South Wales Police.
They claim the force's officers "conducted the investigation with a mindset of guilt towards them" from the start.
Mr Coutts told the court on Monday he took on the job of investigating the claims in July 2003.
Counsel for the claimants, Anthony Metzer QC,  suggested his role was to right a "miscarriage of justice" allegedly perpetrated by the men.
"I never saw my role as an avenging angel," he replied. "I saw my role as having been given this task to carry out a professional investigation - that's what I sought to do.
"And to carry it out in the context of the back story and to do it without fear or favour."
Mr Metzer asked Mr Coutts: "You had it in your mind from the outset that you wanted these officers prosecuted, did you not?"
"No I did not," Mr Coutts replied.
"I was not determined. There was no rush to judgement. Over two months, I spent a period of time setting out the lines of inquiry and looking at the material."
Mr Coutts also denied using the book Fitted In by Satish Sekar, a campaigning journalist, as a "progenitor or bible from which to act thereafter".
He said the book was simply among the material which helped set out the areas that had to be considered, adding: "It was not my job to adopt any person's view of the case."
When asked why Mr Sekar was kept up to date with the investigation, Mr Coutts said: "He was a key stakeholder".
"Why does a campaigning journalist have an interest in the case?" Mr Metzer asked, pointing to a 69-page log recording police contact with Mr Sekar.
"He had been designated as such by a chief officer and I had been instructed to carry on in the same way," Mr Coutts replied.
He denied there was a "total lack of open-mindedness" from the outset of the investigation.
The case continues.

article The "Spy Booth" artwork, showing three figures "snooping" on a telephone box, appeared in Hewlett Road last April.
The "unauthorised" mural was added to the Grade II listed property without listed building consent, so could not be included in its listed status.
Cheltenham Borough Council voted by 12 votes to one to grant the application.
Retrospective planning consent has been granted for changes to the character of the listed building, meaning further permission would be needed if somebody wanted to remove it.
The mural, located about three miles from government listening post GCHQ, has been a source of controversy ever since it appeared.
It has been daubed with white paint, sprayed with silver and red graffiti, had people trying to steal it and businesses and communities fighting over ownership.
But with listed building consent now granted both the mural and the building's satellite dish will be protected from unauthorised alteration or removal.
Martin Chandler, borough council case officer, said: "It will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently but it doesn't mean we won't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it."
"It [planning consent] doesn't automatically mean it's going to be retained in situ."
Robin Barton, from the Bankrobber gallery in London, who has been trying to broker a deal to sell the Banksy, said the listing was "an ill-judged gesture" and "short sighted".
"It will very likely result in the terminal decay of the wall. There is nothing to protect the wall now.
"Now that it's listed no-one can apply any protection to it. It's it absolutely vulnerable to the elements."
Mr Barton said he said he had spent more than Â£25,000 on protecting the work.
"The owner now wants to paint it over and move on with his life," he added.

article Strange's side must now go on to defeat New Zealand in their group, a feat Wales achieved in the 2012 tournament.
"Even though it is going to be more difficult, we've got a fighting chance," said Strange.
After Wales' 26-25 defeat to the Irish, New Zealand beat Georgia 55-0.
Wales took two losing bonus points from the match, and face Georgia in Manchester on Saturday, 11 June, before tackling the top seed All Blacks in Salford on Wednesday 15 June.
"That's not impossible by any means, we'll be preparing well and looking forward to the challenge," Strange said of the New Zealand match.
Grand Slam winners Wales took a 17-point lead against Ireland but were stunned by an Ireland fight-back, while Keelan Giles' 78th minute corner try went unconverted as replacement Jarrod Evans sent a difficult kick wide.
Fly-half Dan Jones created two of the early tries but could only land two kicks from five attempts at goal.
"It's painful after an outstanding first 25 minutes with everything going to plan. But Ireland frustrated us and we gave some soft penalties away, so the momentum quickly changed," Strange told BBC Wales.
"We left [goal-kicking] points out there, but I don't think we lost because of the goal-kicks. There were a number of reasons. We lost composure, we conceded soft penalties and to be fair to Ireland, their recycling game was very good."
It represented a turn-around in fortunes from the Six Nations, when Wales came from behind in the second half against Ireland, France and Scotland to win the title.
"It's all part of their learning, much as you enjoy winning. They'll stay tight, you have highs and lows in rugby but how we respond now as a group is important" Strange added.
Scotland pulled off the surprise of the opening round, beating Australia 15-10.

It is part of a Department for Transport (DfT) and Transport for the North (TftN) study that found average peak-time speeds of less than 15mph.
More work is needed to make a case for the various proposals, TftN said.
The report, which includes other road studies for the North of England, is due to be published by the DfT, with the findings feeding into the Autumn Statement on Wednesday.
Chancellor Philip Hammond will give an update on a number of government spending projects, including transport upgrades.
The Treasury has said an extra £1.3bn will be spent UK-wide to tackle congestion.
The road study for the the north-west section of the M60, aimed at tackling "high traffic flows",  has considered the following options:
A report on the progress of TftN and the DfT said: "The packages would provide significant improvements on the M60 and wider transport network within the study area.
"They would address the existing and future problems, and should be considered for further development."
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority - which represents the 10 borough councils - is due to note the TftN Strategic Studies update on Friday.
TftN is due to issue a report on priorities and costs, and benefits of its studies across the North in April 2017.

article The producers of Spectre have confirmed that the screenplay was taken as part of a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November.
In a statement on the film's official website, Eon Productions said they were concerned the script may be published online.
Spectre is due to be released in November 2015.
The statement said: "Eon Productions, the producers of the James Bond films, learned this morning that an early version of the screenplay for the new Bond film SPECTRE is amongst the material stolen and illegally made public by hackers who infiltrated the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer system.
"Eon Productions is concerned that third parties who have received the stolen screenplay may seek to publish it or its contents."
Filming for Spectre began this month after the title and cast were unveiled in London.
A new car was shown off, but few details were given about the plot for the film.
A Sony spokesman denied reports that the cyber attack had forced the studio to stop production.
"Productions are still moving forward," Robert Lawson told the Reuters news agency.
The Bond franchise is a valuable asset for Sony Pictures, with Skyfall making $1.1 billion (Â£640m) worldwide.
On November 24 hackers disabled the computer network at California-based Sony Pictures.
They also released salary and Social Security numbers for thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities
North Korea has denied being behind the attack in retaliation for a film depicting the country's leader but praised it as a "righteous deed".

article Platini and Fifa president Sepp Blatter have been suspended over allegations a "disloyal payment" was made to Platini in 2011 for work done years earlier.
Le Journal du Dimanche says the memo, dating back to 1998, includes a payment agreement between Platini and Fifa.
Platini's lawyer Thomas Clay called the 23-page document "important evidence".
Clay, speaking to the Reuters news agency, added: "From the moment that we have proof of an agreement between Fifa and Mr Platini, and of knowledge of this agreement by officials of Uefa, then this inquiry falls down.
"For us, it's very important evidence that Mr Platini has always been telling the truth."
Both Platini and Blatter are fighting to salvage their careers and reputation and are currently serving 90-day provisional suspensions from world football.
It is alleged a £1.3m "disloyal payment" was made between Platini and Blatter in 2011.
The two men deny wrongdoing and claim they had a verbal contract for Platini to receive backdated money for work he carried out for Fifa between 1998 and 2002.
Le Journal du Dimanche claims the memo, which has not been seen by BBC Sport, was presented at a meeting of Uefa's executive committee in November 1998 and included a section that stated Platini was being paid 1m Swiss francs a year for work he was doing for Fifa.
"It shows that the contract did not have any sort of secret character and that many people, including those in Uefa and Fifa, have known about it since 1998," added Clay.
Blatter has previously said the 2011 payment followed a verbal agreement between the two while Platini claimed the payment was delayed because of financial problems at Fifa.
Both men are due to attend personal hearings with Fifa's ethics judge starting on 16 December and final verdicts could be published as early as 21 December.
Platini, who had been widely tipped as Blatter's successor at Fifa, still hopes to be a candidate in the Fifa presidential election on 26 February.
However, he will only be entitled to enter the ballot if he clears his name in sufficient time prior to polling day.

"I thought I had a pretty good winter with the Lions, so I was pretty keen to come back in and continue that form here," the 30-year-old told BBC Sport.
Rankin has played one Test, seven one-dayers and two T20 matches for England since switching from Ireland.
He bowled with pace and hostility to help the Bears bowl Hampshire out for 319 after they had been 89-0 at lunch on the opening day of their Championship game.
With the ball swinging, captain Varun Chopra did not introduce Rankin until the 24th over, but he made the most of his opportunity.
"My role is to try and take wickets - thankfully that happened," he said.
Londonderry-born Rankin's sole Test match for England came in the final game of the Ashes series in Australia in January 2014, but he recently went on the second-string Lions tour to South Africa.
He took 28 wickets in seven County Championship matches last season, but is hoping for a more regular place in Warwickshire's four-day side this summer.
And he is hopeful that he can force his way back into the national set up through weight of wickets throughout the season.
"I am just concentrating on playing for Warwickshire at the minute, but you never know what might happen down the line," he added.

article Some of the UK's largest producers have said they are struggling to produce enough of the loved-and-loathed veg.
Lincolnshire supplies almost two thirds of all sprouts produced in the UK, with farmers reporting losses of up to 60%.
Farmer Mike Capps, of RM Capps Ltd, near Boston, said "the damage has been considerable".
He said: "We've had the biggest pile of damaged sprouts ever seen."
"We've actually had one field where we have thrown away about 60% of the crop - so we are below production cost," he said.
Earlier this week, it was reported that one of the  biggest vegetable growers in the Channel Islands lost his entire Christmas supply to the diamond-back moth.
More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire
The diamond-back is also known as the cabbage moth - and that crop, along with cauliflowers is also being affected.
Considerable scientific effort is now being expended to understand more about the moth and to work out how to control it.
Dr Steve Foster, from Rothamsted Research centre, said: "The diamond-back moth is known as a super-pest because it is notorious for its ability to evolve resistance to a wide range of pesticides."
A report on behalf of AHDB Horticulture - an agricultural research firm - found there was a large migration of diamond-back moths in late May.
These moths laid eggs quite soon after they arrived in the UK and their caterpillars had caused considerable damage in some locations.
The report said there was a second generation of diamond-back moth adults in July.
Other areas affected by the invasion included Suffolk, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

article The question is, how much closer? Well, the indications from the final pre-season test are that it might just be enough for Ferrari to make a fight of this year.
The concern among neutrals after two dominant championships from Mercedes and an imposing performance at the first test last week was that Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg et al were simply going to pick up where they left off at the end of 2015.
But the picture has shifted during this week's second test and Ferrari now look much more credible contenders.
This was underlined when Rosberg said at the end of the test: "We know Ferrari are very close - but we're not sure if we're ahead or behind."
Logic alone suggests that Ferrari ought to pose a bigger threat to Mercedes this year.
In 2015, they were on average 0.6secs down in qualifying. Vettel took three wins - to Hamilton's 10 and Rosberg's six. But two of them came about because Mercedes were compromised in one way or another, and the final one on a bizarre off-weekend for the champions in Singapore.
However, rivals believe Ferrari have benefited in the design of their 2016 car by exploiting a loophole in the limits on wind-tunnel time and computer-aided design research that existed as a result of their new partnership with Haas. It has now been closed.
And Ferrari's engine last year had some layout compromises compared to the Mercedes, which have been addressed for this season.
At the same time, as the Mercedes was by definition more optimised last year, in theory there is less room for improvement.
Having said that, it became clear in a media briefing at Mercedes' engine HQ recently that significant gains are still being made in terms of thermal efficiency - and therefore performance.
And the Mercedes chassis has some very interesting innovations on it aimed at improving aerodynamic downforce.
In short, Mercedes have improved on an already formidable package.
The teams spent eight days over two weeks preparing at Spain's Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
But how to divine the truth from the thousands of laps in the face of so many variables - tyres, fuel load, track conditions, engine mode, etc?
As Vettel put it: "Before it was always a question of how much - or little - fuel everybody was running. Today there are 10 other things that have to be considered when looking at the time sheets.
"So in the end it is all guesswork when making statements about who is where in the pecking order. The feeling is good - and that is what is important for me."
The teams have ways of eliminating many of these variables. But they are always reluctant to give too much away. Partly this is because even the teams, with their mountains of data, cannot be absolutely sure where everyone stands.
From the outside, though, it is possible to have a stab at it.
We know the tyres the time was set on. And we can eliminate the effect of fuel weight to a certain degree by looking at how long was the run on which the time was set.
In other words, you might not know the exact fuel load, but you know the minimum the car must have been carrying and can off-set the lap time against that.
It is far from an exact science and any attempt to "correct" the lap times is inherently flawed.
Nevertheless, apply these "corrections" to the list of times and quite often it turns out that a driver's best lap was not the headline fastest at all.
The best lap of the winter, for example, appears to have been one done by Rosberg on the medium tyre on an eight-lap run on Thursday. Hamilton did an almost identical time on Friday morning
So, take each driver's fastest time on each type of tyre throughout the second test and apply these factors corrected to a soft-tyre time, and you end up with a list of the fastest lap for each team that looks like this:
Mercedes (Rosberg) 1:22.6
Ferrari (Raikkonen) 1:22.9
Williams (Massa) 1:23.4
Red Bull (Ricciardo) 1:23.7
Toro Rosso (Verstappen) 1:23.7
Force India (Hulkenberg) 1:24.0
Renault (Magnussen) 1:24.4
McLaren (Alonso) 1:24.6
Sauber (Nasr) 1:24.8
Haas (Grosjean) 1:24.9
Manor (Wehrlein) 1:25.6
That's just single lap times. But Ferrari and Mercedes also did race-simulation runs, albeit on different days. And the average lap times for those are:
Hamilton 1:29.1
Rosberg 1:29.3
Raikkonen 1:29.4
Vettel 1:29.5
If those figures are right - and it's a big "if", with all the caveats and so on - then that suggests Ferrari have about halved the gap to Mercedes over the winter.
At that sort of margin, the difference between the two cars could be small enough to ensure that the typical vagaries of an F1 season were enough to make a proper championship battle between two teams.
Hamilton v Rosberg v Vettel and maybe Kimi Raikkonen, too, if he can get his act together. Sounds pretty enticing, doesn't it?
A small deficit, but one marginal enough to enable a world-class driver to mount a title assault in a car that is not as good as the best, are exactly the circumstances in which Fernando Alonso came agonisingly close to winning the title with Ferrari in 2010 and 2012.
A penny for the the thoughts of the final member of F1's "big three", then, if it turns out this way in 2016, because Alonso could have been driving this Ferrari.
The 34-year-old, as he reminded the world in a Spanish radio interview ahead of the final test, negotiated a way out of his Ferrari contract two years early at the end of 2014 because he lost faith that the team would ever be title contenders.
Ferrari were trying to convince him to sign a new contract until 2019, he said (although senior insiders say the team were beginning to feel they, too, needed a change).
Alonso said driving for Ferrari was a "wonderful experience" but that the stress of all those near-misses had got too much and he was not interested in "staying at Ferrari until 2019 to be third".
"I think I would never been world champion there," he said. "Now I enjoy Formula 1 more 10 positions further behind. I wanted a new project and McLaren-Honda was the most convincing."
Well, it is not that convincing yet, judging by pre-season testing.
Honda has undoubtedly made some serious steps with its engine - hybrid energy deployment, a major shortcoming last year that left the engine as much as 250bhp down on the straights, has improved "massively", according to Alonso's team-mate Jenson Button.
But the engine is still a long way off the pace. Even Alonso allows it may be 80bhp down. Some say it could be as much as 100bhp.
There have been flashes of pace from McLaren, and the team have new parts to fit at the first race that were not ready in time for testing. But the best evidence is that they will be mixing it towards the back of the midfield with the likes of Renault and the new US-based Haas team.
Between McLaren and the front is still the best part of two seconds - and the Williams, Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Force India teams.
On the positive side, Honda's new F1 boss Yusuka Hasegawa has made a good first impression at McLaren and this has renewed confidence within the team that the engine can make the promised significant steps forward this year.
The final days of testing were overshadowed by a series of off-track controversies - about the introduction of a new-style qualifying system and the new "halo" head protection system.
The elimination-style qualifying format will be used in Australia after a week of to-ing and fro-ing that many felt made the sport look ridiculous.
The big problem was Bernie Ecclestone's decision to reveal that his FOM company had told him they could not sort out the timing software and on-screen graphics in time, something one senior insider described as "pathetic".
Had Ecclestone kept his mouth shut, the suggestion from the teams to run the last part of qualifying without the elimination system would have been seen as what it was - them doing what they had been asked to do and pointing out any potential flaws.
Now, FOM has apparently decided it can do the necessary after all and the new format has been adopted wholesale. Despite concerns that in the final shoot-out the action will all be at the beginning, followed by a whole load of nothing because no-one has any fresh tyres left to improve his time.
The drivers are not keen. As Hamilton said: "I've generally enjoyed the qualifying we had for the last few years so that's why the changes we've made don't make sense to me in my head right now. But don't knock it until you've tried it and then immediately we'll get comments from the fans."
As for the halo, yes, some drivers don't like it, especially the world champion; yes, aesthetically it leaves a fair bit to be desired; and, yes, seeing it is a shock to the system.
But one wonders if F1 would not already be using such a device if, for example, Alonso's head had been hit by Romain Grosjean's flying Lotus at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix - a tragedy that was avoided by centimetres.
Alonso was close to Jules Bianchi, who died last July of head injuries sustained in a crash in the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, so it is no surprise to see that he is one of the majority of drivers who back the system, calling it "a step in the right direction".
It was Vettel, though, who arguably put it best, as he referenced the deaths of two drivers in other categories from head injuries in recent years.
"In principle, I agree it doesn't look very nice," the Ferrari driver said. "It's not the picture of Formula 1 you are used to for a long time.
"But equally if it helps increase safety and saves lives… There would be at least two drivers in the last four years that I remember would still be around, Henry Surtees and Justin Wilson, if we had this type of system.
"It can be as ugly as possible - nothing justifies not having these guys around any more."

article Chief executive Simon Stevens told the Guardian newspaper he was proposing a 20% tax on all sugary drinks and foods in NHS cafes to be introduced by 2020.
He said the NHS's 1.3 million staff had a "responsibility" to lead by example, and urged MPs to take similar action.
David Cameron has said he would not rule out a national sugar tax.
How much sugar is hiding in your food?
Analysis: Can we trust the sugar industry?
It is expected the NHS levy, which would initially only apply to sugary drinks, could raise Â£20m-Â£40m a year, Mr Stevens said.
It is hoped the tax would discourage staff, patients and visitors from buying sugary items, while the money raised would be used to improve the health of the NHS's large workforce, he said.
It would be the first public body in Britain to impose a sugar tax.
The Welsh government and the Northern Ireland executive said there were no plans for a similar measure in their respective NHS facilities.
Mr Stevens said: "Because of the role that the NHS occupies in national life, all of us working in the NHS have a responsibility not just to support those who look after patients, but also to draw attention to and make the case for some of the wider changes that will actually improve the health of this country.
"It's not just the well-being of people in this country and our children. But it's also the sustainability of the NHS itself," he added.
Bosses would consult on introducing the tax, which would be gradually enforced as catering and hospital shop contracts come up for renewal over the next three to five years.
The NHS levy would be linked to the government's forthcoming national childhood obesity strategy.
The campaign group, Action on Sugar, welcomed the idea - saying it had been a long-time coming.
However, free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs said the idea was "ineffective, but also unfair".
Head of lifestyle economics Chris Snowdon said: "Taxing soft drinks, no matter where they are purchased, hits the poorest hardest and has never been shown to reduce obesity anywhere in the world.
The proposal comes days after David Cameron signalled that he was prepared to drop his opposition to a sugar tax. Number 10 previously said the prime minister "doesn't see a need for a tax on sugar".
Mr Cameron told journalists it would be better not to have to resort to new taxes but said that "what matters is we do make progress" on obesity.
In October a report by Public Health England recommended a tax of between 10 and 20% on high-sugar products as one of the measures needed to achieve a "meaningful" reduction in sugar consumption.
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has also campaigned for such a move, while a new study in the British Medical Journal said Mexico's sugary drinks tax led to a 12% reduction in sales.
Ian Wright of the Food and Drink Federation, said it was puzzling that Mr Stevens has chosen to pre-empt the launch of Government's comprehensive obesity strategy, by announcing plans for new taxes.
"Public Health England acknowledges that there is a lack of evidence about the long-term effectiveness of additional taxes on food and drink. We can only assume, therefore, that today's announcement is driven more by the need to raise money than by any wish to change behaviours."
Why is sugar so addictive?

article Paul Clarke, from Middlesbrough, was in a restaurant with his wife and two children when the trio burst in on Saturday night.
Mr Clarke said one of the knife-wielding attackers looked directly at him before carrying out the attack.
He said the "horrible" images were still "playing around in his head".
Mr Clarke, his wife Wendy and 14-year-old son Miles were meeting their daughter and her fiancÃ© in the Black and Blue Steakhouse in Borough Market, London.
The family escaped injury but were near the spot where  police shot and killed the three suspects.
Mr Clarke said one of the attackers pinned a member of the restaurant staff to the ground.
"He stood there and looked at me. He had a long weapon in his hand and had a guy on the floor who was in his kitchen whites," he added.
Latest updates on the London attack
Mrs Clarke said they were alerted by screams coming from outside the restaurant and someone shouting "they've got knives and they're killing people".
"I just kept thinking that we wouldn't get out of this alive," she added.
The couple's daughter and her fiancÃ© remained inside the restaurant hiding under a table during the attack. The family were reunited several hours later.
Mr Clarke said his daughter told him she had witnessed two further stabbings.
He added: "I'm still feeling emotionally up and down."

article Pastor James McConnell appeared in court on charges relating to the internet broadcast of a sermon he gave at a Belfast church last year.
Belfast Magistrates' Court was told Pastor McConnell will be denying "moral or legal culpability" on the charges.
Several hundred people gathered outside the court in support of the preacher.
His solicitor said the 78-year-old "did not incite hatred or encourage violence against Muslims".
"He simply expressed his view about another religion, not in a personalised manner but in an entirely generalised way," he added.
Pastor McConnell, of Shore Road, Newtownabbey, is charged with improper use of a public electronic communications network and causing a grossly offensive message to be sent by means of a public electronic communications network.
The remarks were made at the Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle in north Belfast in May 2014 and were streamed online.
His solicitor told the court that Pastor McConnell believed freedom of speech "should mean he has every right to criticise Islam and other religions, just as Islamic clerics have the right to criticise him and Christian clerics".
"We are pleading not guilty - a very candid not guilty," the solicitor said.
He added that the case was "one of the most bizarre, peculiar... I have ever seen before these courts".
He asked the prosecution to indicate if any of the four main witnesses in the case were prepared to give evidence against the pastor.
A prosecution lawyer said statements were given to police, with any further contact expected after the defendant's attitude is formally entered.
The defence solicitor added: "There are approximately 1,000 people here, Pastor McConnell is a revered pastor in the greater Belfast area."
The case was then listed for another hearing on 3 September.

article A High Court judge awarded the payout to Catherine Rooney after deciding that cleaning the cup fell within regulations on work equipment.
Mrs Rooney had been washing up in the kitchen area at Anne's Primary School, Londonderry, in March 2011.
The court heard that the handle on a mug broke off and sliced into her lower arm, damaging a tendon.
She later underwent surgery on her injuries at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and was off work for about a year.
She had taken off her gloves while drying the crockery.
In her action against the Western Education and Library Board it was accepted that her induction training did not include using gloves while drying items.
The claim centred on whether Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 applied to her case.
Mrs Rooney's lawyers argued that a cup does constitute equipment, while the defendant contended that it did not come within a list of work tools.
Ruling on the action, the judge held that pots, pans, cups and glasses being used to provide food and drink at the school fell within the regulations.
"This plaintiff cleaning the cup in question was using it, as part of the equipment of the kitchen as it had become, in her capacity as an employee of the defendant at her work," he said.
On that basis he held the defendant liable for breach of statutory duty.
Dealing with the level of pay-out Mrs Rooney is entitled to, the judge noted she has been left with a permanent scar.
He made an award of £25,000 general damages, plus a further £1,944 in special damages.
Loss of earnings put at just under £3,776 also featured in the outcome, along with interest and legal costs for the plaintiff.

A woman in her 30s died at the scene in Bridge Street, Guildford. Police said she had yet to be formally identified but her next of kin had been informed.
Another pedestrian, a man in his 40s, remains in hospital in south London.
The man, who suffered serious pelvic injuries, was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting.
A third pedestrian, a woman in her 30s, who had minor injuries has also been discharged from hospital.
Witnesses who were in the area at the time described a major emergency response with several police cars blocking the road and the Land Rover Defender involved covered from view.
A green screen was erected around the crash site.
Surrey Police is continuing to appeal for witnesses to the accident to come forward.
The crash came just months after another crash near the main entrance to the Friary Centre when a car hit pedestrians and left several people injured, including a toddler and his baby sister.
The collision happened in North Street last October.
Leader of Guildford Borough Council, Paul Spooner, said Saturday's accident was "tragic and saddening".
"We await the outcome of Surrey Police's investigation and until the full reasons are known it is impossible to comment on what the cause could be," he said.
"Although we don't know if the road layout contributed, the Town Centre Masterplan includes options for improving transport and pedestrian movements around the station area and Bridge Street."

article People were said to be vomiting and suffering dehydration after an iftar meal, to break the daily Ramadan fast.
The Hasansham U2 camp, between Mosul and Irbil, houses people displaced by an Iraqi offensive to capture Mosul from so-called Islamic State (IS).
IS fighters are currently under heavy siege in the west of the city.
The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said in a statement that around 800 cases had been recorded, 200 of whom were taken to hospital.
Unconfirmed reports say a second person, a woman, has died.
The agency said it was "extremely concerned" by the events at the camp.
"Staff have been working closely overnight to co-ordinate the response with other agencies and the relevant authorities... to ensure that those who have fallen ill were able to receive swift medical treatment and that the seriously sick were provided transport to nearby hospitals," the statement said.
The food, containing beans, chicken and yoghurt, was prepared in a restaurant in Irbil and brought to the camp by a Qatari charity, Rudaw news agency added.
It quoted camp supervisor Rizgar Obed as saying that outside organisations had previously been banned from bringing in food, but the camp authorities had been forced "under great pressure" to change the regulations.
People are being treated in three hospitals in the area.
The restaurant owner has been arrested, Rudaw reported.
The camp is one of 13 built by the UNHCR in the Mosul area to cope with people fleeing from the city and surrounding villages.
It currently houses 6,235 people.
Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, launched an offensive last October to recapture Mosul from IS.
They started an assault on the west of the city in February.
Fewer than 1,000 militants are now besieged in IS-controlled parts of the Old City and several adjoining northern districts, along with some 100,000 civilians.
More than 800,000 people - about a third of the pre-war population of Mosul - have been displaced since October, 633,000 of them from the west of the city.

But how can you help to remove false news from the internet and what are the big platforms doing to help?
In our earlier guide to spotting fakes during the US election, we gave you some ground rules to help with identifying false or misleading reports.
Armed with these you can progress to reporting it to the authorities, in this case large multinational corporations from the USA.
This is the one everyone is talking about. Why? Because you would like to be able to trust your friends and family to get things right, even that relative who has not made sense for at least a decade.
With its huge reach - 1.7bn users and counting - when news starts travelling on Facebook, it really travels.
If you are unsure about a post, find the little chevron/down arrow in the top corner - we've ringed it for you in the image above - and then pick the "report post" option.
Do you think it should be on Facebook? No.
Then tell them why.
Just one more thing... For thoroughness, we'd recommend doing all of the options.
The search giant is where you go when you want to check what your friends are saying, is true don't you?
Its chief executive Sundar Pichai says fake news should not be distributed. And we agree.
Imagine how we felt when we searched for paid protesters.
That is the same fake site pretending to be ABC News, that we're using throughout this article to test how you can report fake news.
If you want to tell Google, you will need to scroll to the bottom of the page and click on send feedback.
Keep it clean and factual and include the link you are reporting.
Do not forget to send them a screenshot. They even let you highlight the most fake of the fake bits.
While the micro-messaging platform has been big on cracking down on abuse and threats, its tools for reporting fakery are limited. Here is our story again...
You will need to click the chevron in the corner or the three dots under a tweet, then chose "report tweet".
It is not really spam, and no-one is "interested" in fake news in their feed. It is harmful, but not in the ways Twitter then lists.
So we are just going to have to suggest you click spam or not interested, depending on how generous you are feeling.
The options at the top of the list for reporting a post tell you something about what the biggest issues apparently are for Instagram users.
Right at the bottom are two options that might fit...
There is no obvious function on Instagram to simply say "this is fake" other than to report it as spam.
Once you have completed your civic duty, we wouldd recommend putting on the kettle, making a cup of tea and having a slice of cake. You have earned it.
(In case you are wondering, the story we're using as an example is definitely fake, or so the hoaxer behind it told the Washington Post).

article The MPs said net lending by banks using the Funding for Lending scheme had fallen by £2.3bn since June 2012.
It added there was little understanding of where support was most needed.
But the government said the report did not reflect reality and that credit conditions were improving.
Funding for Lending is the scheme launched jointly by the Bank of England and the Treasury to boost lending to the real economy.
Under the scheme, banks and building societies were allowed to borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England, as long as they then loaned that money to individuals or businesses.
The scheme was recently modified to exclude individuals, as the Bank believed mortgage lending had picked up sufficiently and no longer needed special support.
The latest Bank of England figures show that all lending to businesses fell by £4.3bn between September and November 2013.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises have a vital role to play in driving the UK's economic recovery... but many still struggle to access the finance they need," said Margaret Hodge, chair of the committee.
"[Government] departments manage their various schemes not as a coherent programme but simply as a series of ad hoc initiatives."
She said the Department for Business and the Treasury could not demonstrate that they were "achieving best value for taxpayers' money."
The report also criticised the government's Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme, which looks to help businesses that have been turned down for bank loans.
The number and value of loans provided by the scheme had fallen in each year between 2010 and 2013, the report said.
The committee said that the two government departments were unable to show that the schemes launched to boost lending had addressed the market failures they were designed to correct.
However, the government challenged the report's findings, saying they did "not reflect the reality, which is that credit conditions for small and medium enterprises are improving, new lending is being provided and small businesses are being offered cheaper loans rates".
A spokesman for the Bank of England also told the BBC that many businesses now prefer to raise money by themselves, rather than taking a loan from a bank.
He also said that the latest figures on business lending showed an improving situation.
While business lending in 2012 fell by £1.5bn a month on average, in 2013 it fell by £1.1bn a month.
The committee of MPs said the new British Business Bank, which is launching this year and will have £1bn of capital at its disposal, should help drive more lending to businesses.
The British Chamber of Commerce said it agreed with much in the report, but called on the government to go further in its plans for the Business Bank, so that "it is customer-facing, better capitalised from the outset, and has the ability to lend directly to businesses".
The committee's report comes a week after the Labour party called for greater competition in banking and for the break up of some the UK's largest banks.
Party leader Ed Miliband said the City had been "an incredibly poor servant of the real economy", adding that banks should be doing more to help businesses grow.

article Greece midfielder Tziolis signed a short-term deal until the summer and made his Hearts debut in the 4-1 win against Rangers.
"I spoke to him [Karipidis] and he told me all about the best of the club, the city and the supporters - that helps me a lot," he said.
"The style of football is a bit different but football is football."
Tziolis, 31, agreed a switch to Hearts after being freed by PAOK Salonica and speaking to close friend Karipidis, who starred for the club between 2006 and 2008.
"I asked him [Karipidis] what he thought," said the midfielder. "He told me it's a very good opportunity for you to go there, play in a stadium that's always full with supporters who are always very warm about the team and I took the decision after those good words."
Tziolis, who has 62 caps, admits he only knows some "basic things" about Scottish football and sees his move as an opportunity to learn more about Scotland's top flight.
Hearts assistant coach Austin McPhee played an instrumental part in Tziolis' move, after seeing him playing while in his other role as assistant manager of Northern Ireland.
"My agent told me about the interest and Mr Austin called me and we spoke and he told me he knew me from the national team," Tziolis added.

"I haven't played much football this season, maybe only two international matches in a few months. But that's in the past, now I'm here and you can be sure I will give everything to help the team."
After playing for 30 minutes against Rangers, Tziolis is ready to start against Motherwell this weekend. And he is already thinking about the upcoming Edinburgh derby on 12 February, after the city rivals were drawn against each other in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup.
"Everyone is talking about this match," he said. "I have played derbies in Greece ask me after that match about the difference."

article Cardiff hit the woodwork twice as Joe Ralls smashed the post with a long-range first-half strike and Anthony Pilkington hit the bar with a volley.
Johnnie Jackson wasted a good opening as the Charlton captain headed over Johann Berg Gudmundsson's cross.
And Charlton's Simon Makienok missed two late chances as Cardiff hung on.
The Bluebirds were reduced to 10 men for the final minute of injury time after midfielder Sammy Ameobi was dismissed for a second yellow card.
The point moves Charlton off the bottom table but they are now six points from safety after MK Dons and Bristol City both won.
It was a battle of the sides with controversial owners and in a week where Vincent Tan vowed to halve Cardiff's £140m debt, Charlton fans handed out 2,000 Pinocchio masks and stickers before kick-off in the latest protest at Addicks owner Roland Duchatelet.
And their mood would not have been helped if Anthony Pilkington's header had not been deflected over with barely a minute on the clock.
Ameobi and a Peter Whittingham free-kick went close for Cardiff before midfielder Ralls' 25-yard shot cannoned back off the post.
Charlton's Reza Ghoochannejhad tested Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall before an unmarked Jackson headed Gudmundsson's corner into the ground and over.
Pilkington twice worried the Charton defence either side of the interval before the Cardiff striker hit the crossbar when his clever flick from Scott Malone's cross had home keeper Stephen Henderson beaten.
But Charlton, with the second worst defensive record in the league, held firm and the hosts could have won their first home game since early November in added time.
Zakarya Bergdich forced Marshall into a smart save before Cardiff defender Bruno Ecuele Manga cleared Makienok's effort off the line as the Welsh side drew their 13th match this season, the joint highest in the whole league.
Charlton head coach Jose Riga:

"Cardiff deserved to win the game, but for me the most important was to see a reaction from my players. The way we played pleased me a lot.
"Now we must make sure we keep this up in the next game. With these efforts we will get what we deserve.
I'm realistic. Results have not been the best, but what can we do?
"If you think and act like a team you can do a lot things. I believe in work, commitment and I always stay optimistic. It's a step forward."
Cardiff City manager Russell Slade said:
"We opened up in an effort to try and win three points rather than take just one. We had something like 22 shots and if there's any criticism we've probably only had three or four on target and that is what cost us dearly.
"We felt it was two points dropped massively. We were in some good situations and it was the final shot or pass that let us down. We didn't have the final ruthless streak which was going to bring us home the three points.
"The Ameobi red card was a little bit soft and it's a disappointing."

article The ceasefire had been in place since December 2014.
Farc said it wanted a full bilateral truce but stressed it was not abandoning the long-running peace talks taking place in Havana.
Meanwhile President Juan Manuel Santos has called on the rebels to "speed up" the negotiations.
The two sides have been in on-off negotiations since 2012 in an attempt to end more than half a century of conflict.
Thursday's attack - in the country's south-western Cauca region - was the deadliest since the resumption of air strikes against the rebels last month.
The guerrilla group said in a statement that the ceasefire suspension was the result of "five months of land and air offensives against our structures all over the country".
"We deplore the joint attack by the air force, the army and the police," said the statement.
"We feel pain for the deaths of guerrilla fighters as well as soldiers, sons of a same people and from poor families".
But the group said they were willing to continue with the latest round of peace talks in Havana.
"Against our will we will proceed with the [peace] talks in the middle of a confrontation," they said.
They also reiterated their demand for Mr Santos to agree a bilateral ceasefire.
The peace talks in Havana between Colombia's government and Farc rebels were shaken in November when the rebels captured a high-ranking army general, who was later released.
They were shaken again in April when the rebel group ambushed an army unit and killed 11 of its men.
Now another flaring of violence will pile even more pressure on the men and women sitting around a table in the Cuban capital.
The decision by the Farc to suspend its ceasefire seems to suggest an intensification of Colombia's half-century-long internal conflict. More attacks by the group are expected, as well as new government offensives.
But both the government and the rebel group insisted in the wake of this latest confrontation that they will not abandon the negotiations in Havana.
Moreover, some analysts in Colombia believe that this apparent setback could in fact be the first step towards a bilateral ceasefire.
Mr Santos, who restarted air strikes against the rebels last month after 11 soldiers were killed in an ambush, addressed the rebels via his Twitter account.
He wrote: "Gentlemen of the Farc: now is the time to speed up the negotiations. How many more deaths do we need to understand that we have arrived at the time for peace!" he wrote.
Thursday's military action comprised an air strike and ground assault against the rebel group in Guapi, Cauca, said officials.
The operation's aim was the capture of a rebel known by the alias "Javier", and two rebels were captured along with those killed, defence ministry officials told the Efe news agency.
At the previous round of peace talks, the Farc called for the dismantling of right-wing paramilitary groups fighting against the rebels.
The two sides failed to reach an agreement over reparations for the victims of the conflict, an issue that has been wrangled over for months.
November 2012 - Formal peace talks begin in the Cuban capital Havana between the Colombian government and the Farc.
May 2013 - A deal is reached on land reform, one of the most contentious issues. It calls for fair access to land, and rural development, two key causes of the conflict.
November 2013 - The two sides agree on the political participation of the Farc should a peace deal be reached.
May 2014 - Both parties pledge to eliminate all illicit drug production in Colombia.
December 2014 - Farc declares a unilateral ceasefire.
March 2015 -  Both sides agree to work together to remove landmines. Colombia is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.
April 2015 Government resumes air strikes after the Farc kills 11 soldiers in ambush.
May 2015 Farc suspends its unilateral ceasefire after government military operation kills 26 rebel fighters.
What is at stake in Colombia's peace process?

article In a statement, the rebels cited "many and large violations" of the ceasefire by the Syrian government as the reason for their move.
Turkey and Russia brokered the ceasefire deal that has mostly held since last Thursday.
The peace talks are due to be held in Astana, Kazakhstan.
"The regime and its allies have continued firing and committed many and large violations," said the statement signed by a number of Syrian rebel groups on Monday.
"As these violations are continuing, the rebel factions announce... the freezing of all discussion linked to the Astana negotiations," they said.
The statement highlighted fighting in the rebel-held region of Wadi Barada near Damascus. In recent weeks the rebels have accused the government and its allies of trying to recapture the area, which supplies water to the capital. The military has denied the allegations.
On New Year's Eve, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to welcome the Russia-Turkey efforts to end the Syrian fighting and to organise peace talks.
The new ceasefire deal applies across Syria but excludes the jihadists of so-called Islamic State (IS) and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS), and the Kurdish YPG militia.
On the one side, Syrian government forces, allied militias and the Russian military.
On the other, the FSA plus several other groups.
The Russian defence ministry named seven "moderate opposition formations" included in the truce as Faylaq al-Sham, Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Islam, Thuwwar Ahl al-Sham, Jaysh al-Mujahidin, Jaysh Idlib and Jabhah al-Shamiya.
Ahrar al-Sham, which said it had "reservations" about the deal, and Jaysh al-Islam are Islamist groups that Russia has previously described as terrorist organisations.
IS and JFS and the groups affiliated to them are not part of the agreement, according to the Syrian army.
JFS said on Friday it would continue to fight President Assad, with a spokesman saying the political solution under the truce would "reproduce the criminal regime".
Members of the group are currently operating as part of a rebel alliance that controls Idlib province.
The FSA also said the deal did not include the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG).
The militia, which has captured large swathes of north-eastern Syria from IS with US support, is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey.
The truce is nominally nationwide, although it really only covers the areas where the sides who have signed up have a presence - western Syria.

article Dozens of trainee drivers had MRI scans before and after they acquired "The Knowledge", memorising hundreds of journeys and street names.
The University College London team, writing in Current Biology, found brain parts linked to memory grew bigger.
They said it proved the brain could adapt to new tasks, even in adulthood.
Earlier studies of the brain of the cabbie had already noted the increase in "grey matter" in the hippocampus, an area found at the base of the brain.
However this research tried to work out if the change had happened during the intensive learning period prior to starting work, or on the job itself.
They scanned a total of 79 trainees, just before they started to learn the "All-London" Knowledge, which can take between two and four years to complete.
Would-be taxi drivers have to learn 320 routes within a six mile radius of Charing Cross, which covers a mind-boggling 25,000 streets and 20,000 landmarks and places of interest.
Throughout the process, any changes to their brains were mapped by regular MRI scans.
Compared with similar scans from non-taxi drivers, those who had attempted the Knowledge had increased the size of the posterior hippocampus - the rear section of the hippocampus which lies at the front of the brain.
As would be expected, they were better at memory tasks involving London landmarks than the non-cabbies, but this advantage appeared to come at a price, as the non-cabbies outperformed them in other memory tasks, such as recalling complex visual information.
Prof Eleanor Maguire, who led the study, said: "The human brain remains 'plastic', even in adult life, allowing it to adapt when we learn new tasks.
"By following the trainee taxi drivers over time as they acquired - or failed to acquire - the Knowledge, a uniquely challenging spatial memory task, we have seen directly and within individuals how the structure of the hippocampus can change with external stimulation.
"This offers encouragement for adults who want to learn new skills later in life."
The reasons why the brain was able to adapt remain unclear, although the hippocampus is one of the few areas of the brain in which new cells can grow.
Dr John Williams, head of neuroscience and mental health at the Wellcome Trust, which helped fund the research, said: "Only a few studies have shown direct evidence for plasticity in the adult human brain related to vital functions such as memory, so this new work makes an important contribution."

article The British Film Institute's (BFI) report says the industry has a "pandemic lack of inclusion".
It also says the UK needs 10,000 people over the next five years to maintain its position in world film production.
Women earn Â£3,000 less than men on average, the report added.
It also says 40% of the UK's film workforce is made up of female employees.
Compiled by the Work Foundation for the BFI, the research estimates there will be 30,000 job opportunities coming up in the UK's film business over the next five years, which the BFI says is worth Â£4.3bn to the economy.
Ms Broccoli said: "We live in a diverse society and it is vital both culturally and commercially that our industry reflects this in front of and behind the camera."
Ms Broccoli, who chairs the UK Film Skills Task Force, attended the House of Commons on Wednesday with Culture Secretary Karen Bradley, BFI chair Josh Berger and BFI CEO Amanda Nevill, to launch a 10-point skills plan.
The culture secretary said the UK film industry is "one of our biggest success stories" and that there was a need "to nurture and foster the next generation of talent".
She said the skills plan "will be instrumental in helping to deliver this, as well as making sure that the films in the UK are truly representative of the UK's diverse society".
Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, which produces the Star Wars films, said: "More points of view, more perspectives, and more voices will only make films better".
The report says the UK's film workforce includes 12% of people from less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds, and that five per cent have a disability.
Three per cent of the production and post-production workforce are from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background.
The research cites a culture of nepotism, unpaid work experience and a lack of appropriate training as being reasons why people are prevented from entering the industry.
There are even bigger problems for minority groups, the report's authors say.
Thousands of people study for film-related qualifications, but not enough train for required positions, they add, which is leading to skills shortages in nearly 40 types of positions, such as first assistant directors, costume designers, carpenters, production accountants and 3D model makers.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts in the United States faced criticism in 2015 when all 20 contenders in the main Oscar acting categories were white, and there were no female nominees in the directing or writing categories.
This led to academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs saying the organisation was "committed to seeking out diversity of voice and opinion''.

article But Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil said it would not reveal its plan until they had been "properly costed".
His comments came after new amendments to the Scotland Bill were lodged by the UK government.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the amendments made it "crystal clear" that Scotland could act on tax credits.
Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser asked Mr Neil during a Holyrood debate on the issue to confirm that the amendment to the Scotland Bill would give the Scottish Parliament the power to replace in full any reduction in the tax credit.
Mr Neil responded: "The amendments tabled today should give the Scottish Parliament those powers, but until today none of the amendments tabled would have given us that power.
"We will properly address the needs of people affected by cuts in tax credits.
"We will establish the most effective way to administer any top-ups to tax credits. We will properly cost our proposals before we bring them before this parliament. We will identify where any additional funding will come from.
"Unlike Labour we won't draw up our proposals on a whim without proper research and consideration. We will make sure we get this right for the people of Scotland."
There is another element to this which probably explains the caution inside the Scottish government.
That element is the fiscal framework which accompanies the transfer of new powers. It is still being negotiated - with hard, if courteous, bargaining on either side. Indeed, Mr Mundell was repeatedly questioned in the Commons by Angus Robertson and others with regard to the timetable.
John Swinney does not want to make commitments - especially costly commitments - before he knows the full story. Before he knows the full powers, before he knows the full extent of the cuts to tax credits, before he knows the scope of the concomitant fiscal framework.
Which left the Scottish government sounding just a mite discomfited at various points today and since Labour announced its policy on Saturday. But there will be more to come, there will be other days.

But Mr Neil said the proposals still did not go far enough, and pledged that the SNP would continue to press for tax credits cuts to be scrapped entirely and to call for all tax credit policy to be devolved to Holyrood.
Scottish Labour gave an immediate pledge to restore tax credits in full and pay for it with the Â£250m coming to Holyrood with the devolution of air passenger duty (APD) and income tax from high-earners.
The party had tabled a motion calling on the Scottish government to use the new tax and welfare powers coming to the Scottish Parliament to restore tax credits.
The motion was backed by 62 votes to 48 after being heavily amended by the SNP to state "that the parliament believes that the UK government's proposed changes to tax credits would leave working families worse off".
Afterwards Labour accused the SNP of a "shambles" and "betrayal" over tax credits.
Scottish Labour's finance spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: "The SNP have spent days telling us we wouldn't have the power to top-up tax credits, yet Alex Neil now accepts that's just not true.
"Yesterday Alex Neil issued a press release demanding tax credits be devolved, even though he conceded today that the power to top-up tax credits is already being devolved. Why can't the SNP just embrace the new powers instead of always talking Scotland down?
"The tax credit debate exposed what really matters to the SNP government - constitutional grievance rather than helping working families in Scotland."
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives accused the Scottish government of failing to understand the detail of the powers being devolved to Holyrood.
"This U-turn explains why the SNP spends all its time complaining about powers it doesn't have," he said.
"It's because it hasn't got the first clue what powers it is getting nor what to do with them. The so-called competent SNP has been exposed today as a total shambles."â€Ž
Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the "ideologically-driven cuts" to tax credits would directly affect 250,000 Scottish families and 300,000 children.
He added: "Alex Neil made a ludicrous U-turn in the course of a single six-minute speech. He changed his mind halfway through about whether he has the power to mitigate these damaging tax credit cuts. It is the final nail for claims of SNP competence.
"The SNP have spent so much time sticking the boot into the Scotland Bill they have lost sight of how powerful it is."
The SNP accused its political opponents of being more concerned with "cheap political attacks" than with mitigating the effects of the proposed cuts.
SNP MSP Mark McDonald said: "While our first priority is to stop tax credit cuts happening in the first place - unlike Labour, who appear to have run up the white flag - if these cuts do go ahead, the SNP in government will set out sensible, credible and costed proposals to support low-income households."

article NFU Cymru said a sharp increase in the number of cattle slaughtered in Pembrokeshire is "hugely damaging".
The remarks come on the opening day of the Pembrokeshire County Show.
The Welsh Government said it would continue to tackle all sources of infection "in the most appropriate way to address the TB situation in Wales".
Statistics recently released by the Welsh Government revealed that in the 12 months to May 2016, 8,973 cattle were slaughtered in Wales due to bovine TB - a 37% increase on the previous year.
In Pembrokeshire, 2,652 cattle were slaughtered in the same period - a 61% increase on the previous year.
However, the number of new herd incidents of the disease in Wales had dropped by 17%.
Speaking at the Pembrokeshire County Show, near Haverfordwest, NFU Cymru president and dairy farmer Stephen James said: "This scale of loss is hugely damaging and totally unsustainable for the industry in Pembrokeshire.
"These latest figures are a clear illustration that the measures currently in place to eradicate this disease are not working in parts of the country like Pembrokeshire where the disease is also endemic in the wildlife population.
"If we are to eradicate bovine TB in Wales then this government has to support the implementation of a policy that will actively remove the disease from the wildlife population in areas of Wales where both cattle and badgers are suffering."
A spokesman for the Welsh Government said the environment and rural affairs secretary would consider options for a "refreshed" TB programme over the coming weeks.
"As part of that, she will be considering the wildlife issue alongside new cattle and biosecurity measures," the spokesman said.
"It is clear from the epidemiological evidence presented to date that we should be exploring a more targeted approach at farm and area level."
summary A cattle union has said the number of cattle killed in Wales is "unacceptable".

article Rescuers using sniffer dogs have been at the Didcot A Power Station site since a major incident was declared.
A rubble pile up to 30ft in height is being searched by specialist teams.
Thames Valley Fire Control Service said the collapse was a "very severe incident", which left five other people needing hospital treatment.
Live updates on the Didcot collapse
Four are in stable and non-life threatening condition, while one man is in a serious but not life-threatening condition at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, a spokesman for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said.
During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron sent his "sincere condolences to the family and friends of the victim and best wishes to the injured and those still missing".
Ministerial meetings on the matter had already taken place with further meetings taking place later, he added.
Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, the Conservative MP for Didcot, said the man who died and the three people who are still missing are based in the North.
He said he was "hoping and praying" for the missing men and their families.
"I don't think anything will prepare me for seeing the site itself," he added.
Coleman and Company, the Birmingham-based firm behind the demolition, tweeted it was "working with all stakeholders to establish facts" and urged concerned relatives of employees to get in touch.
Emergency crews said two drone aircraft with thermal imaging cameras were being used in the search at the site, where a 100m cordon is in place.
Fire officers said no signs of life had yet been found.
Assistant chief fire officer Simon Furlong said: "We've had no significant signs [of life], but that doesn't mean to say there isn't saveable lives still within the building."
The former coal-fired power station was turned off in 2013, after 43 years in service, and demolition work had been taking place.
The neighbouring gas-fired Didcot B power station which opened in 1997 continues to operate.
Speaking from the scene, Mr Furlong said the operation was being hampered because of safety concerns.
He said: "This is a very difficult situation with a very unstable structure.
After a long night rescue teams are weary, but still the search continues.
Crews here are using more high tech devices, a drone with sensitive listening equipment is scanning the debris to try and pick up any trace of the three missing people, who all here hope are still alive.
The task ahead though, is considerable. A full half of the 984ft long turbine hall has collapsed, and in its place there's a 30ft high pile of debris, including an estimated 12,000 ton of twisted metal.
All here are keen to stress this is not a recovery, but a rescue mission.
"The safety of emergency service personnel has to remain our priority, while recognising how hard this must be for families waiting for news of loved ones.
"Our sympathies are with them, and the family of the person who died here."
The service said experts from Cheshire who were involved in a search at a wood flour mill following a fire were being brought on to the site to advise on the search.
Rescue teams from Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, the West Midlands and Merseyside are also involved.
A joint statement by the emergency services said the building, which is 300m long and 10-storeys high, was due to be demolished in the coming weeks.
An Npower spokeswoman said the building had collapsed "while an external demolition contractor was working in it."
"Our thoughts are with the families of all those involved in this tragedy," he said.
Initial reports suggested an explosion took place at 16:00 GMT on Tuesday but the company confirmed a partial collapse had led to the whole building coming down.
A Health and Safety Executive investigation has also been launched.
The fire service said dust from the collapse covered a "considerable area" but there were no hazardous materials in the building.
Fifty people were treated at the scene for dust inhalation.
Residents were urged to remain inside and keep doors and windows closed.
Adrian Redhead, who lives about a quarter of a mile away, said he had just got home from work on Tuesday afternoon when he heard a "massive noise".
He said: "It sounded like a train had come off the rails. Sirens were all over the place. I looked outside and saw all the dust. There were loads of emergency vehicles.  A load of dust came over the house."
Oxfordshire's coal-fired Didcot A Power Station was turned off in 2013, after 43 years in service.
The station included six cooling towers, measuring 375ft (114m) in height, which dominated the skyline of the town.
Hundreds of people gathered to watch when three of the towers were demolished in the early hours of 27 July 2014.
RWE Npower expects complete deconstruction of the site by the end of this year.
A gas-burning power station - known as Didcot B - opened in 1997 on the site and continues to operate.
A major fire was declared at Didcot B in October 2014, with 20 fire crews sent to tackle the blaze, which was caused by an electrical fault.

article Monday's rally was being held outside parliament in the capital, Skopje.
Mr Gruevski, who was at the rally to address the crowd, faces wire-tapping and corruption allegations but denies wrongdoing and has refused to resign.
An anti-Gruevski protest camp has been set up outside government offices.
Power struggle in Macedonia
The camp, which still holds hundreds of protesters who say they will remain until Mr Gruevski quits, is about 2km (1.5 miles) from Monday's pro-government rally.
Descending on the mass rally, supporters of the prime minister waved red and yellow flags and chanted "Macedonia! Macedonia!" and "Nikola! Nikola!"
One demonstrator who gave her name as Snezana told Reuters: "We're here to defend our country. It's time we stand up against this dark foreign scenario."
The opposition Social Democrats accuse the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders.
Their leader Zoran Zaev says scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings.
But Mr Gruevski, who has won successive elections since 2006, has repeatedly rejected the allegations.
He has accused Mr Zaev of orchestrating a coup at the behest of unnamed foreign spy agencies who, he says, want to overthrow his conservative government.
Adding to the political instability, last weekend eight police officers and 14 ethnic Albanian fighters were killed in clashes in the city of Kumanovo.
In 2001, Macedonia was on the brink of civil war when armed rebels demanded greater rights for the Albanian minority, which makes up about a quarter of Macedonia's 2.1 million population.

article She said a number of incidents had given PCCs a "bad name", including criticism by Surrey's Kevin Hurley of his former chief constable Lynne Owens.
But she also revealed she was planning to extend the powers of PCCs after their elections in May.
This could include them setting up free schools for "troubled children".
PCCs, who replaced the previous model of police authorities, have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.
They were first elected in November 2012 on a historically low turnout, and the next set of elections takes place in May.
At a Policy Exchange event in London, Mrs May acknowledged some of the problems involving PCCs had made her wonder if she had done the right thing by establishing the system as a replacement for police authorities.
She said: "In 2012, you could be forgiven for thinking that we were creating a monster. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't times over the last three and a half years when I thought we might have done just that."
She highlighted incidents including the former South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright's initial refusal to resign following damning revelations of child sexual abuse in Rotherham; the appointment of a youth commissioner in Kent with no background checks, only for her to have to stand down after it was revealed she had posted offensive tweets as a teenager; and the dispute involving Mr Hurley.
The BBC recently learned Mr Hurley had strongly criticised his chief constable Lynne Owens before her appointment as the new National Crime Agency head.
"These episodes have been disappointing and there's no doubt that some of them have brought the office of the PCC into disrepute," said Mrs May.
Labour has said it would abolish PCCs and put the savings into front-line policing.
But Mrs May proposed an expansion of their role. She said the government had not yet decided the "full extent" of its proposed changes but said there were "significant" opportunities for reform.
"The next set of PCCs should bring together the two great reforms of the last Parliament - police reform and school reform - to work with and possibly set up alternative-provision free schools to support troubled children and prevent them from falling into a life of crime," she said.
The home secretary suggested mergers between PCCs and directly elected mayors, saying there was a "fantastic opportunity" for policing and other services to be brought together "under a single directly elected mayor".
PCCs could also have a role in youth justice, probation and court services, she said.
This suggestion was welcomed by the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said it "makes sense" to give locally elected leaders control over the services.
The think tank's Jonathan Clifton said: "This will enable them to join up with other local services and tackle the things that lead to offending - such as lack of qualifications, mental health problems and homelessness."

article Increasingly services are springing up offering quick fixes for the annoyance of cracked screens or broken home buttons.
New entrant, iCracked, is hoping its model of sending technicians to customers, sometimes within an hour, will help it win market share.
But critics questioned what impact it would have.
The firm already operates in 250 US cities and as the name suggests, focuses mainly on iOS devices but also repairs some Samsung models.
The prices it will charge for fixing devices will vary but will average about £57, according to the firm.
"For most people, their phone is an extension of themselves, so when it breaks it can have a huge impact on the way they go about their everyday lives," said founder A J Forsythe.
The firm began life in 2010 at a US university where Mr Forsythe was a student.
"I started handing out flyers around campus and people would call me and I'd fix their device," he told the BBC.
Growth came fast and the firm now employs 1,000 technicians across the US.
Its UK launch will initially be focused in London with 30 technicians which it hopes to expand to 100 next year.
Customers can call out a fixer either via the iCracked website or its app. They then arrange a time for them to come to their home, office or local coffee shop to repair the device.
There is a burgeoning industry springing up around smartphone repairs. High street shops offer drop-in services where they can repair phones or tablets in a matter of hours, often more cheaply than iCracked.
Websites such as Quick Fix Mobile also offer repairs within 24 hours, with prices averaging £30 - £50 for a broken screen.
Marketing manager Sean Barber was dismissive of iCracked.
"I'm not sure why these big companies come from the US and make such big news. There are already plenty of others in the UK already offering this service."
He compared iCracked's launch with that of Uber, the lift-sharing service which has proved controversial to the taxi industry.
"I don't think iCracked is going to disrupt the market like Uber did. You still have to book an appointment with a technician and in that time, a customer could have come to a service like ours and had it fixed," he said.
Mr Forsythe admitted that some may question the need for an emergency service for iPhones, but said that demand was there.
"We're seeing hundreds of requests each day and we are expecting London to be one of our busiest cities.
"I wouldn't say that it is limited to a First World problem."
Apple did not wish to comment on the service but on its website it advises customers to contact their carrier or Apple to arrange service for damaged devices. Users can also take broken phones into stores.
There is also a growing trend for do-it-yourself services such as the Restart Project - which gives amateurs advice on how to extend the life of their gadgets.

article John Holmes, 53, who taught at Landau Forte College, Derby, grabbed the Year 8 pupil during a geography lesson.
A National College for Teaching and Leadership disciplinary panel banned him from teaching for two years for "unacceptable professional conduct".
However, the panel accepted Mr Holmes had not made a genuine threat to kill.
Mr Holmes's actions, in the summer term of 2012, were said to have been prompted by the pupil giving the wrong answer.
The teacher, who started working at Landau Forte College in 1992, received a police caution for possessing a blade on school grounds after the matter came to light in April 2013.
Mr Holmes expressed remorse but explained that what took place had happened in a "jovial manner" during a "light-hearted" quiz, the panel said.
Giving the panel's decision, NCTL official Paul Heathcote said: "We accepted that there was no intention to cause the pupil harm and that Mr Holmes's actions were not intended as a genuine threat to kill."
However, he said Mr Holmes was "guilty of unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute".
"He has not shown clear insight into the implications of his behaviour," said Mr Heathcote.
Stephen Whiteley, chief executive of Landau Forte Charitable Trust, said that following "detailed internal and external investigations appropriate employment procedures were then followed" and Mr Holmes "ceased to be employed at Landau Forte College as of August 31, 2013".

article A metal detectorist unearthed the fragments of the guns, thought to date back to the 15th Century, at the site in Towton, near Tadcaster.
The find contradicts the idea that guns were only used in that period of history to attack castles.
Experts say it sheds light on the use of guns by troops in medieval battles.
Tim Sutherland, an archaeologist visiting the University of York, said the unearthing of the parts of gun barrels was "incredibly important" - but possibly unlucky for the soldier who had been holding the weapon in the conflict in 1461.
The manufacturing of firearms in that period of time was notoriously unreliable, Mr Sutherland said.
He revealed the reason the guns were probably not found intact was that it was not uncommon for the weapon to explode in the user's hands because of metal casting faults.
Experts at the ISIS Research Centre in Oxfordshire, which uses neutron analysis to examine samples in minute detail, said the finds were "unique in Britain".
Mr Sutherland said: "In terms of its rarity, we don't know of any other battlefield where one of these has turned up.
"In terms of the Towton battlefield, it's very important because we're looking at the cusp of the use of archery and the introduction of handguns.
"When we analyse the internal coating, that has the constituent parts of gunpowder.
"It's incredibly important and we still can't believe we've found this."
He added: "We have fragments of handguns that exploded during the Battle of Towton - how rare can you get? It's unbelievable."
The Battle of Towton saw up to 28,000 soldiers killed on a single day and has been named as one of the bloodiest battles to ever take place on English soil.
Metal detector user Simon Richardson, who was trawling the site for objects said he was not sure what he had found on the battlefield.
He said: "I found two pieces on two separate occasions.
"I had an idea of what they were, but it's pretty rare.
"I had previously found a lead ball, so I knew guns had been used."
Dr Evelyn Godfrey, who analysed the fragments at ISIS said the fragments had revealed more about battlefield weapons.
She said: "We have looked at the crystal structure of the objects
"Almost certainly there are two different alloys which came from two different castings.
"They are almost certainly from two different guns."
But the effectiveness of early battlefield firearms was not a refined art.
"The weapons did more damage and scared horses than it did to the opposition," Mr Sutherland said.

article After coming out of a near three-year, deep-space hibernation in January, the satellite now has sufficient power to check out its science payload.
The spacecraft is currently about 675 million km from Earth, and continues to close in on its comet quarry.
Rosetta should arrive at the icy body in early August, when it will then start mapping the object to find a safe spot to put down its little lander.
This craft, known as Philae, is piggy-backing the main probe, and was set to receive its wake-up commands on Friday. It will be another week, however, before they are actioned.
Dr Matt Taylor, the European Space Agency's Rosetta project scientist, told BBC News: "The mission as a whole had this big emotional moment in January when the spacecraft was woken up.
"Now, individual teams must experience something similar again as each one of Rosetta's 11 instruments is turned on for testing."
The first item to be brought back online was the camera system: Osiris.
This is the equipment that will most engage the public as it acquires the pictures of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
The second instrument listed for switch-on was Alice, a spectrometer that will be used to study the gases streaming away from the 4km-wide ball of ice and dust.
It will take the rest of March and all of April for controllers at Esa's operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, to work through the entire instrument package.
Although the tight constraints on power consumption have eased somewhat since the January wake-up, Rosetta is still roughly 640 million km from the Sun. This means the careful approach to energy management continues.
"The fantastic news after hibernation is that the solar arrays haven't degraded, so we are in an optimal state for power," explained Sylvain Lodiot, Rosetta's deputy spacecraft operations manager. "But the situation is still marginal and we cannot yet run the instruments in parallel."
Most of the instruments will be switched off again immediately after their check-out.
The key exception is Osiris. It will stay on because it is needed to help plot the precise position of 67P on the sky. This leads to the next big event in the mission - the major manoeuvre that will start to refine Rosetta's trajectory to the comet.
This will be initiated on 21 May with a seven-hour, 21-minute burn on the spacecraft's thrusters.
A further eight burns are then planned over the summer, with Rosetta set to go into orbit around 67P in the first week of August.
Dr Taylor has been preparing himself this week for the rendezvous with a visit to a tattoo studio.
He now has Rosetta, Philae and 67P pictured on his thigh.
"When I arrived on the project, I promised I'd do it. I'd had one done for Esa's Cluster mission, and when Rosetta came out of hibernation, I said, 'right, let's get it done now'.
"The place where I go is run by an old friend from school. He's done all my tattoos."
Rosetta is being billed as the big space event of 2014.  The plan is for the probe to escort 67P as it moves closer towards the Sun, monitoring the changes that take place on the body. The Philae lander will report changes that occur at the surface.
Comets - giant "dirty snowballs", as some have called them - are believed to contain materials that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the Solar System.
Rosetta's data should give researchers some fresh insights, therefore, on how our local space environment has changed during the past 4.6bn years.

article Under the new rules, Cubans will not have to go through government middlemen to sell agricultural produce.
For the first time in decades, farmers will also be allowed to take their products to market themselves.
The farm reform follows recent moves liberalising Cuban house and car sales.
The government said the new rules were meant to cut down on transportation costs and speed up food delivery to the tourism industry.
'Better supply'
According to Granma, the reform will allow farmers to "develop mechanisms to supply tourist entities and take better advantage of the potential of all forms of local means of production".
Tourism is a key source of revenue for Cuba, but visitors often complain about the poor quality of food.
The government is hoping the reform will help provide fresher and more varied products, boosting Cuba's attractiveness.
Under the current rules, a state-run body has a monopoly on the sale and distribution of agricultural products.
Prices and production volume are set at the start of each harvest.
Critics say the state-run system has led to high volumes of food rotting before it could be distributed.
The reform is part of a larger overhaul of Cuba's Soviet-style economy, which has already led to changes allowing Cubans to set up their own small businesses and buy and sell cars and homes.

article Ministers wanted employees to organise the payment of union dues themselves by other means such as direct debit.
But unions argued that this would be more complicated for members and so lead to a loss of funds.
Lord Bridges of Headley announced a "pause" in the plans, saying there were "cannons" attacking them on all sides.
He told peers the government would change the Trade Union Bill to remove the end to "check-off" at its next stage in the House of Lords, saying the move had never been intended to undermine the union movement.
"Arguments have been made with considerable vim and vigour that by ending check-off and moving to direct debit, those on low pay and especially those who have pay day loans might have to cease being trade union members or have to pay extra bank charges," he said.
"Again, this is not our intention and never has been."
The payment of subscriptions by deduction from wages can now continue - providing the union bears the administrative cost.
The Conservative peer who led the parliamentary campaign against the move, Lord Balfe, said he was "delighted" to be able to tear up the speech he had been about to make opposing the government.
"I think it was clear to anyone who looked at the detail that the government's proposals on check-off stood to do considerable damage both to the unions themselves and to their members and potential members," he said.
"I was particularly concerned about the impact on low paid, mostly female workers, who stood to lose out on the protection and benefits of trade union membership."
The TUC welcomed the U-turn, thanking all of those who had lobbied the government over the issue.
"Banning workers from choosing to pay union subs in a convenient way through their payroll would, as many have warned, damaged industrial relations and morale in key services," said its general secretary Frances O'Grady.
"While this is an important milestone, the TUC remains opposed to the Trade Union Bill in its entirety and will continue to push for further changes when it is debated again in the House of Commons next week."
Ministers are standing by other key aspects of the bill, such as the introduction of electronic balloting and restrictions on political funds used by unions for campaigning, despite a series of defeats in the Lords.

article Teachers at Caherline Elementary School in Caherconlish, Limerick, say they have noticed a difference in pupils' behaviour since installing outdoor speakers to play music during playtime on Fridays.
Headmaster Michael McCarthy says the music does far more than just getting the children out in the fresh air with each other.
"It really has broken down the barriers between the boys and girls and also with the different age groups," he added.
"It's just brilliant when you see the bigger children taking the little ones by the hand and dancing with them."
The sessions are for all the children in the school whose ages range from four to 13.
"It's half an hour where there are no barriers," said Mr McCarthy.
"At first, the boys stood back but they dance now even if they're playing football! And even the playground staff start to tap their feet."
Two separate videos of the playground disco have been viewed more than a million times on Facebook since being posted last week.
One Facebook user posted: "Playtime parties, why was this not around when I was young."
Mr McCarthy says the idea came from the pupils themselves.
"We set up a school council and the children always raise lots of good ideas at meetings," he added.
"The girls in particular love dancing, they are always in the playground making up dance routines and singing. But boys and girls love music."
After some negotiation Mr McCarthy agreed to allow the music during playtime on Fridays.
"We had some school funds so we went and bought a speaker and set it up in the playground.
"Basically it's an outdoor disco."

article At a US congressional hearing on Tuesday, she also said she was "disturbed" by the company's previous comments about the high cost of replacing the defective parts.
General Motors (GM) has so far recalled 2.6m cars because of the defect.
But it has been criticised for taking too long to do so.
Faults with ignition switches in some GM models, including the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion, were first reported more than 10 years ago.
But the company only began recalling vehicles in February this year, a month after Ms Barra took over as chief executive.
"I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced... but I can tell you that we will find out," said Ms Barra, testifying before a US House of Representatives panel investigating the issue.
"As soon as l learned about the problem, we acted without hesitation. We told the world we had a problem that needed to be fixed.
"We did so because whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now and in the future. Today's GM will do the right thing.
"That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall, especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured.
"I am deeply sorry."
Ms Barra said she found it "disturbing" that cost considerations may have discouraged an immediate replacement of the faulty switches.
The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Republican Fred Upton, told Ms Barra: "With a two-tonne piece of high-velocity machinery, there is zero margin for error; product safety is a life or death issue.
"But sadly, vehicle safety has fallen short."
GM's initial recall affected 1.6 million cars made before 2007, and last week the company announced it would also cover more than 800,000 made from 2008-11.
At issue is a flaw in the manufacture of the ignition switch that causes the key to shift on its own from the "run" position to the "accessory" or "off position", even while the car is at full speed.
GM has launched an internal investigation into the matter, and last month created a new senior post to oversee vehicle safety and recalls.
And in the first hint that victims may be compensated, Ms Barra said GM would bring in consultant Kenneth Feinberg to help the company plan what to do "for those who suffered the most from this tragedy".
Mr Feinberg handled compensation issues related to the attacks in the US on 11 September 2001, the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and last year's Boston Marathon bombing.
On Monday GM announced a separate recall of more than 1.3 million vehicles because of an electronic power steering threat which, it said, "could increase the risk of a crash".

article As finance minister, she referred his long-running dispute with bank Credit Lyonnais to an arbitration panel, which awarded him 400m euros (Â£340m) damages.
Mr Tapie was a supporter of ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Critics say she abused her authority but Ms Lagarde denies any wrongdoing.
"This search will help uncover the truth, which will contribute to exonerating my client from any criminal wrongdoing," Ms Lagarde's lawyer, Yves Repiquet, told the Reuters news agency.
The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says investigators suspect Mr Tapie was granted a deal in return for his support of President Sarkozy in the 2007 election.
There is speculation in France that Ms Lagarde could yet be placed under formal investigation in this case, he adds.
The origins of the case date back 20 years.
Mr Tapie, who has long been active in French business, sporting and political circles, sued Credit Lyonnais over its handling of the sale in 1993 of sportswear brand Adidas, in which he was a majority stakeholder.
After years in the courts, the case was referred by Ms Lagarde to an arbitration panel in 2007 and she approved its decision to award damages.
Critics said the case should not have been settled by private arbitration, since public money was at stake in the bank, which was part-owned by the state.
The settlement Mr Tapie received is believed to be a far greater sum than he would likely have received from the courts.
In an interview in January, Ms Lagarde stood by her decision, saying it was "the best solution at the time".
Ms Lagarde replaced the disgraced IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was arrested in New York in 2011 on allegations of attempted rape.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's lawyers settled a civil case for an undisclosed sum and a criminal investigation was dropped by US prosecutors last year.
However, our correspondent says that Ms Lagarde's position at the IMF could be in jeopardy if she is placed under formal investigation.
Her term as IMF chief does not expire until 2016, but amid the complexities of Europe's economic crisis this is a distraction she can ill afford, he adds.

article To the Italians, she is Francesca Marina. To her mother, she is simply called Gift.
Just four days old, the baby was born on an Italian naval rescue ship, the Bettica.
Her mother, Stephanie Samuel, is recovering in the same hospital in Ragusa. They endured a 10-hour boat ride, and eight hours of labour.
Stephanie Samuel had worked as a housemaid in Tripoli but after two years, and with a deteriorating security situation in Libya, she decided that even though heavily pregnant, she had to escape.
"I think that Italy is more good than Libya, so I decide to come to Italy," she explained in broken English. "I thought I would come to Italy and have the baby a week later."
Despite the dangers of the crossing - it cost her $600 (530 euros) in a boat packed with nearly 100 other people - she was prepared for the risk.
"I'm not scared," she said. "I make up my mind, and I'm not scared, because I believe there is God."
Her husband, Valentino, is still in Libya. He received news of the birth in a telephone call.
"I told him I'm here safely and I have a baby, a baby girl, and he was happy," she said.
"I'm happy to have Gift, she's my first daughter, my first born," she added.
Stephanie Samuel had been brought on board unconscious. She was having fits, and the medics had to administer a sedative to allow her to give birth.
Dr Sara Modde, of CISOM, the emergency services of the Order of Malta, was the doctor on board. She had only delivered two babies previously.
"The labour was really intense and exhausting, because the mother was continually sedated - to prevent her epileptic attacks we used Valium," she explained.
"It was difficult since it was her first pregnancy, and she was delivering in a very difficult situation."
A tent was set up on deck to allow privacy, but when the baby finally arrived, the whole ship heard about it.
"With one last push Stephanie let out a great cry. So everybody outside knew that a baby girl had been born," she said.
"The other migrants started clapping, and singing hymns. Even though it was the middle of the night, the entire crew, including the captain, joined in."
Dr Modde explained that the crew chose the name Francesca after Francis of Assisi. And Marina means "navy" in Italian.
Without the Italian rescue services, Stephanie and Gift's journey could have ended in tragedy.
But despite the pain and the suffering of their crossing they made it to here in Sicily and the promise of a better life.
And for the tens of thousands of other migrants, still waiting to cross the Mediterranean, that story is likely to inspire, rather than deter them from making their own journey.
Gift is still in a serious condition in the intensive care unit.
Stephanie Samuel says their journey is far from over. When she recovers, she expects to go to a reception centre on the island.
She hopes that they can stay in Europe, and that her husband may yet get to meet his baby daughter.

article Mr Robinson came under fire last week for defending comments made by Pastor James McConnell.
But on Tuesday he met Muslim community leaders at Belfast Islamic Centre and apologised to them.
"I apologised face to face, personally, man to man, the way it should be done," he said.
Speaking outside the centre on Tuesday evening, after his private meeting, Mr Robinson said that he respected the people he had met and understood just how important a role they played.
"This society does depend on people from ethnic and religious minorities for the day-to-day life of our province," he said.
"I can't spend the rest of my life apologising, but what I can do is spend the rest of my life building the united community in Northern Ireland," Mr Robinson said.
He added that he now wanted to draw a line under the matter.
Among those attending the meeting was Muhammad Asif Khattak, one of the two Pakistani men who was attacked in north Belfast at the weekend.
The deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, said the public apology was "the right thing to do".
"There is an onus on all of us in positions of political leadership to represent everyone in our society," he said.
"That involves promoting equality, mutual respect and tolerance and standing up for all communities.  Those are the key principles of the Good Friday Agreement.
"It also demands that we stand up to racism wherever and how ever it is manifested. I would now urge Pastor McConnell to take a lead from the first minister on this and publicly withdraw his damaging and insulting comments."
South Belfast MLA Anna Lo also welcomed the apology.
"It offers us the opportunity to move forward, from words of reassurance to actions that will make a real difference to the lives of people from minority communities," she said.
Mr Robinson came under fire last week for defending Pastor McConnell's remarks. The first minister told the Irish News he would not trust Muslims involved in violence or those devoted to Sharia law.
However, the DUP leader said he would "trust them to go to the shops" for him.
Mr Robinson later said his remarks had been misinterpreted.
At Stormont, earlier on Tuesday, assembly members condemned the recent racial attacks and expressed their opposition to racism, discrimination and intolerance.
The assembly passed, without a formal vote, a motion calling for all parties to show leadership on the issue and urging the first and deputy first ministers to bring forward a racial equality strategy as a matter of urgency.

article David Howman, who chairs the Athletics Integrity Unit, said he could not guarantee August's event in London would be completely clean.
But he told BBC Radio 5 live Breakfast he would "ensure the best possible anti-doping programme is in place".
Howman is also urging athletes to talk to the unit about their concerns.
Several British athletes face losing their world records after European Athletics announced it wants historical records rewritten because of the doping scandal.
Paula Radcliffe, Jonathan Edwards and Colin Jackson are among those whose records are under threat.
The International Olympic Committee has also embarked on a programme of retesting old samples - leading to the disqualification of more than 100 athletes from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics.
That has led to retrospective medals for Britain's Goldie Sayers, Martyn Rooney and Kelly Sotherton.
Howman, a former director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency, acknowledged emotions are running high in the sport.
"We're going to be talking with all those athletes who are angry - we've started that programme already," he said.
"What we are doing in terms of our task is to ensure that the athlete voice is heard and those who do want to come forward to talk to us about any aspect can do that. The first opportunity to do that will be in London."
The World Championships will take place from 4-13 August.

article Incumbent Conservative PM Stephen Harper is fighting for a rare fourth term but the frontrunner is Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, son of late prime minister Pierre Trudeau.
The left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) could also play a decisive role.
Opinion polls have suggested many people are still undecided.
Voting hours are staggered across the country and polls opened in Newfoundland at 0830 local time (1100 GMT). Polls will close in the west of the country at 19:00 (02:00 GMT).
It is one of the longest and possibly closest election campaigns in Canada's history, with leaders criss-crossing the country to try to sway undecided voters.
Mr Harper, 56, is selling himself as the steady hand who can steer Canada's troubled economy back on track.
His campaign has run TV advertisements saying that Liberal leader Mr Trudeau, 43, is "just not ready" to take office.
"Every single vote for a Conservative candidate is a vote to protect our economy against Liberal and NDP deficits and taxes," Mr Harper told supporters in Regina, Saskatchewan, on Sunday.
As polls opened, he tweeted that a vote for the Conservatives would "protect Canadian jobs and our economy".
Mr Trudeau started the race in third place but the Liberals took the lead in opinion polls in a late surge.
Stephen Harper's final stand?
The Toronto Blue Jays have their first home game in the playoffs for baseball's American League Championship series, and a sea of fans wearing blue T-shirts are filling downtown Toronto ahead of the big game.
But will blue be the dominant colour for the other big result of the night? After nearly a decade in power, the Conservatives (the blue team in this political race) are fighting to stay in office.
The Liberals (red) led by the photogenic Justin Trudeau have been ahead in the polls. If they win it'll be a stunning victory for a party which began this race in third.
If Mr Harper hangs on, he'll pull off an equally impressive feat in becoming the first prime minister to win a fourth term in more than a century. Either way this election will be historic. Will Canadians plump for continuity or change?
Speaking in Calgary, Alberta, on Sunday, Mr Trudeau urged voters to "come together as a country".
Mr Trudeau's father, Pierre, is considered the father of modern Canada.
NDP leader Tom Mulcair, 60, is hoping to build on his party's second-place finish in the 2011 elections.
However, support for the NDP appeared to have fallen in recent weeks.
At a stop in Toronto, Mr Mulcair hit out at the Liberal leader, saying: "They may try to fool you by giving the old car a fresh coat of paint. But as we've seen, the Liberal Party is just as rusted-out underneath as it was when Canadians kicked them out of office for corruption the last time."
An opinion poll released on Sunday showed the Liberals on 37.3%, seven points ahead of the Conservatives at 30.5%. The NDP had 22.1% according to the Nanos survey taken on October 15 to 17. The margin of error was 2.2%.

The Exiles host 10th-placed Worcester on Sunday and could move above the Warriors with a win.
"We've already spoken about next week and what we need to do," Coventry told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"The boys have had a bit of a hurry up in the changing room. We've spoken about how disappointed we were with our second half performance (at Sale)."

Irish conceded 26 unanswered points in the second half as Sale ran in a total of six tries at the AJ Bell Stadium.
It was the second time in their last three Premiership matches Irish failed to score any second-half points.
And following news that prop Ben Franks will be ruled out until late April with a ruptured bicep tendon, Irish have been hit by a further injury to winger Alex Lewington.
The 24-year-old is expected to be sidelined for up to six weeks following surgery on a fractured thumb.
"Injuries are a big part of the game, we have to rely pretty much on the squad that we've got," Coventry added.
"We can't lament our losses too much, we have to get on with it.
"Losing Ben and Alex is a frustration, but we'll just have to manage without out them until we can get them back on the field."

article Having made Vineries Close in Sipson their home since 2010 they are not prepared to give up their self-built homes easily and have offered their supporters workshops and coaching lessons in how to defend the land.
There is fighting talk from the group of squatters who, under the name of Grow Heathrow, have occupied a slice of greenbelt land in west London for the past four years, seducing their supporters with a post on their website, offering up nature's rewards.
"If Grow Heathrow hasn't been evicted, we're going to bottle loads of blackberries. Bring clean empty jars and you will earn respect, win honour and know true righteousness. If we have been evicted, we'll just go and eat blackberries."
The 15 full-time activists and their hundreds of supporters have cleared the site of 30 tonnes of rubbish and created a self-sufficient community, all in defiance of a third runway being built at Heathrow.
Behind the "doors" they care for the land, building homes from trees, selling produce in the local shop and offering workshops on subjects from bike maintenance to foraging, for anyone who wishes to join them.
The group wanted to create a "place of resistance" for Sipson residents who had seen "the heart ripped out of the community" with the buy-up of land and property by the airport in anticipation of a new runway.
But while Sipson properties may have been spared under new plans, which would see a potential runway built further west than originally proposed, the Grow Heathrow protest site still lies in its path.
The land is owned by businessman Imran Malik and although the activists have garnered support from local residents, MPs and even a judge, they have been told that despite the commendable work it is time to hand the land back to its rightful owner.
Last year Mr Malik, represented by Burch Phillips & Co Solicitors, secured a ruling to evict them, a decision that was upheld during a challenge by the activists at the Court of Appeal in July.
The result means the bailiffs are due to arrive later.
Georgia Woods, 21, who moved to the site when she was 18, said: "It's very hard not knowing what's going to happen and for the incredible space to be threatened."
The squatters moved onto the site in March 2010 but it is not just a point they wanted to make, it was also about trying to save homes and livelihoods.
Ms Woods said: "We don't get paid but we all have to do things that make the site run, like growing food or running the free community workshops.
"With the solar panels and wind turbine we have more than enough energy for phones, lights and music. We have totally normal electricity but you learn to appreciate the weather so much more.
"It's really understanding the power of community and a gift economy."
Ms Woods' home has come from the land too.
"Mine's made out of hazel and it's just very small and has got a little woodburner which we built," she said.
"We're happier and creating a lighter footprint on the world rather than causing harm to someone through our consumerist polluting lifestyle."
Despite the idyll of living on a currency-free land, Grow Heathrow does recognise harsh reality and has been trying to buy or rent the land from Mr Malik.
The group has so far offered Â£50,000, which they say is "above market value" and would have been generated through a crowd-funding project.
John McDonnell, MP for Hayes and Harlington, who has supported the squatters "from the first day" said: "We've been trying to get involved in some formal negotiations and asked them to get around the table, we're quite happy as a community to rent the site.
"We've heard nothing back from the solicitors, but the door is always open."
Whether or not it is right that an MP supports the squatters, Mr McDonnell said it had been a "tremendous success and a brilliant asset".
"It's a demonstration that a small part of land can be so environmentally sustainable, it's a shining example of what you can do through voluntary effort and what Grow Heathrow have done is turned it back to what it was, an environmental benefit for the area," he said.
However, little consideration has been given to what happens after the bailiffs arrive.
Rob Hickley, 32, a gardener, said: "We're not really thinking that far ahead yet, but with the relationships made over the past five years perhaps people will stay with others in the community.
"People will be made homeless as a result of this."
Heathrow Airport said it recognised that as well as "bringing huge advantages to the UK and the local people" a new runway would have "downsides for people living nearby".
It said: "That is why we have rejected our previous plans for a third-runway and have put forward a new option further to the west of the airport, which strikes a better balance between the need for growth and local communities like Sipson."
That is of little consolation to the squatters, who will be evicted regardless of where a runway could eventually be built.
Ms Woods said: "It's been four and a half years, we had no idea it would last that long. We thought it was going to be squatted for potentially months, so it has been a success.
"Everyone's pretty apprehensive and it's pretty scary, but we're not doing anything wrong, we're doing amazing things."
Mr Malik attended the site with the bailiffs on Friday morning but declined to comment on the situation.

article It is the first time a woman, and a bisexual, has been placed at the top of the list, compiled by networking group OUTstanding and the Financial Times.
Alan Joyce, chief executive of Qantas, is in second, with HSBC's UK and European chief, Antonio Simoes, third.
The list aims to highlight positive lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender role models in business.
Suki Sandhu, chief executive of OUTstanding, said everyone on the list was helping to challenge the assumption that you cannot be both openly LGBT in business and be successful.
"Those featured are an inspiration to anyone who fears that they may have to be closeted at work, and waste valuable effort muting their authentic selves," he said.
Ms Beale, who became the Lloyd's chief in January 2014, said she was delighted and honoured to appear on the Top 100 list.
"I am proud of the commitment of Lloyd's and the London insurance market to celebrate diversity and ensure we are an attractive, globally relevant and inclusive sector," she said.
Mr Simoes, who topped the inaugural ist, said companies needed workforces that reflected modern society.
"We still have some way to go before everyone feels confident enough to express themselves in an authentic way at work. Initiatives like this are a powerful statement that attitudes are changing and we are making genuine progress," he said.
Martine Rothblatt, the transgender chief executive of United Therapeutics, is in fourth place, with Burberry boss Christopher Bailey in eighth place.
Those appearing on the Top 100 list were nominated by peers and colleagues. Nominations were reviewed by OUTstanding's judging panel, which included former BP chief executive Lord Browne and Dawn Airey, the former Channel 5 boss who is now chief executive of Getty Images.
Nominees were scored on the seniority and influence of their role, their impact on LGBT inclusion inside and outside the workplace and their business achievements.
All nominees agreed to be included on the list. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was nominated by many people, but OUTstanding said it was unable to secure his permission to be included and had therefore omitted him.
Mr Cook wrote in a Bloomberg article last year: "If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is ... then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy."
OUTstanding's full Top 100 list can be viewed here.
The organisation has also compiled an Allies list, with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in first place for his work championing LGBT diversity both within his company and globally.
Last year's winner, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, is in second place on the 2015 list.

article It is no longer a connection between the coloniser and colonised, and there is a lot of chatter on how relevant the UK has become to India, but signs of the deep connection between the two countries are undeniable and ever present.
The BBC presents five things that Indians think fondly of about the UK, and vice versa.
The English Premier League
The chants, the roars, the team jerseys and fanatical fan frenzy.
The Indian fan clubs for Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea are all officially recognised by their parent clubs in the UK, and they organise free screenings of matches for members with discounted food and drinks.
Walk into most bars in Mumbai or Delhi on any weekend evening, and you will be hard pressed to believe that you're actually in India. From fist pumping celebrations to anguished moans to taking celebrations out on to the streets, it's all there.
Whisky
To say that Indians love their whisky would be a gross understatement. The country consumed a whopping 1.5 billion litres of the drink in 2014, which allowed it to retain its spot as the world's largest consumer of whisky, according to a research note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This love for whisky is estimated to be worth more than $10bn (Â£6.5bn) and has attracted some pretty serious players like Diageo, which in 2012 bought a 53% stake in India's United Breweries. And who do we have to thank for that? Why the UK of course!
PG Wodehouse, Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie
Jeeves and Wooster, Hercule Poirot, the Famous Five, Miss Marple, Silky and Moonface have been, and continue to be, some of the best loved literary characters in Indian popular imagination.
PG Wodehouse in particular has a cult following in India, and the complete collection of the Jeeves books is a fairly common item in the average Indian library.
Similarly, many Indians grow up on a diet of Enid Blyton, who is also squarely responsible for fostering strong cravings for typical British foods in Indian children, many of whom have vivid memories of disappointment when their parents told them that they could not have scones and clotted cream for tea because no one knew how to make them.
Latest addition: JK Rowling. We may be Muggles but many of us are Harry Potter fanatics. And bonus points for the Patil twins!
Benedict Cumberbatch...
...deserves his own post. Sherlock Holmes is also a much loved literary character in India, and no one has quite embodied the role like Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC series.
The television series is so popular here that it is aired concurrently with the US and UK.
Sherlock reruns and Sherlock marathons are also frequently aired on Indian television channels.
Cumberbatch also has as wide a female fan following in India as he does anywhere else in the world, and many Indian hearts were broken when it was announced that he had married Sophie Hunter.
Music matters
We love British music. We love it so much we gave the UK.... Freddie Mercury!
But joking aside, the Beatles, Queen, Oasis, The Who, The Rolling Stones and lately Ed Sheeran and Adele have dedicated and passionate fan followings in India.
We know all the lyrics to Bohemian Rhapsody, Wonderwall remains a popular sing-along song, and Adele's croonings have made us all question the futility of love.
And no hipster bar is complete without an exhaustive Beatles playlist. In fact the Beatles is still very much a part of essential Indian college listening. Blame George Harrison and the Hare Krishna movement!
Curry
Any Briton who's ever had a night out will have ended up in a curry house at some point.
It's more than a meal to the Brits - it's a social tool, a mechanism for old friends, new colleagues and Sunday league footballers to bond over. When the silver bowls of silky sauces arrive, accompanied by duvet-like naan bread, it's an antidote to the UK's national dish of bland (if comforting) fish and chips.
The nation's lust for tikka masala, korma and jalfrezi is said to be worth Â£4bn to the British economy, and curry frequently appears on the list of the UK's favourite foods, even topping that list at various points in recent years.
So what if the dishes served in Britain are but an imitation of the actual ones cooked in Indian homes? And who cares if some of the restaurants are actually run by fellows from neighbouring Bangladesh? A takeaway Indian curry on a Friday night remains the perfect reward for a long, hard British week.
It is a truth universally acknowledged that any Brit heading for India will visit the Taj Mahal. None of them would dream of skipping the world's most famous monument to love.
And for the British, there is a particular poignancy, as it was here that Princess Diana was photographed alone in 1992, the brightness of the white stone shining a harsh light on her solitude. By the end of that year, she and Prince Charles had separated, and the image of the princess alone on that bench still tugs at the nation's heart strings to this day.
On a happier note, the Taj Mahal has also given its name to many of the nation's beloved curry houses.
When there's a problem to be solved in the UK, the first order of business is to pop the kettle on.
Tea is the glue that holds British society together, fixing relationships, mending friendships, a pool into which problems can be poured. The blood of the nation is dark or milky, depending on your taste.
Tell any Brit you'd like a "builder's tea" and they'll know exactly what you mean (so strong you might not get the end of your spoon back).
Commercial production of tea in India began after the British East India Company took control of large areas of the country, with the drink eventually becoming popular in Britain in the 1920s. To us, Assam and Darjeeling aren't just names, they're old friends.
Our prime minister even fell in love with the Downing Street tea lady, once. Well, all right, that was Hugh Grant in Love Actually, but everyone believed it could happen. Whose eye wouldn't be caught by someone with an endless supply of tea and chocolate biscuits?
The British just can't get enough of harking back to the days when India was part of its empire.
This isn't a time that everyone looks back on fondly of course, but that hasn't stopped dramatic tales from that era becoming and remaining popular with the British to this day, for whom India remains exotic and impossibly romantic.
Earlier this year a show called Indian Summers, about the British occupation of India set in 1932, gripped so many Brits that a second series has been commissioned.
And lately both of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies, about a group of elderly Britons living in a retirement home in India, captured many hearts across the UK. And, perhaps, changed a few minds about where to spend one's golden years.
The British East India Company's fight against malaria led to a tipple much beloved by Britons to this day.
Quinine was found to prevent the disease, but was bitter to drink so adding water, sugar, lime and gin to the quinine made the elixir more palatable. Soldiers in India were already given a gin ration, so it all made sense.
These days a gin and tonic is the crispest, cleanest drink a Briton can have, as much a refreshment on a hot summer's night as a fashion statement, to be held while propping up a cocktail bar. Cheers, India!

article Liz Page's mother, Phyllis Lilley, 94, was admitted to Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester after a stroke last year.
The hospital, which has apologised, called to say she had passed away during the night.
Mrs Page told The Sun it did not enter her mind that the body would not have been her mother.
Speaking to BBC News, she said: "I last saw my mum on a trolley with an oxygen mask over her mouth in A&E, [her death] was the news I was expecting.
"My husband took me about an hour or so later. We were shown a lady in a cubicle, she looked like my mum looked when she'd been asleep in her chair, with her mouth open and her nose in the air, and her hair stuck to her forehead.
"I just said simply 'goodbye' and kissed her forehead."
Mrs Page returned home with her husband to Charminster, near Dorchester, and began making funeral arrangements until the hospital rang up later that day to say there had been a mistake and her mother was still alive.
"The gist was that my mum wasn't dead, they found her in another part of the ward," Mrs Page said.
"Nobody should receive news that someone has died, be shown the wrong body in a state of grief and then find out they're alive."
Mrs Page said staff told her the woman who died had a similar name.
She has never revealed the ordeal to her mother, who is now in a care home. Mrs Page said she decided to speak out to help prevent future mix-ups.
Dorset County Hospitals NHS Trust said it was an "unacceptable situation" and it had fully investigated the March 2014 incident.
A spokesman added: "Mrs Page made a complaint to the trust and received a full explanation and apology from the chief executive.
"We are extremely sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Page and her family. The staff involved were also very upset by what happened and lessons have been learnt. Nothing of this nature has happened since this incident 18 months ago."
The hospital said the mix-up had led to a change in its procedures.

article Government adviser Abdul Basit Haroun said smugglers were hiding IS militants on boats filled with migrants.
He based his claim on conversations with boat owners in parts of North Africa controlled by the militants.
He alleged that IS was allowing them to continue their operations in exchange for 50% of their income.
The UN estimates that 60,000 people have already tried to cross the Mediterranean this year.
More than 1,800 people are feared to have died making the journey in often overcrowded and unseaworthy boats in 2015 - a 20-fold increase on the same period in 2014.
In an interview with BBC Radio 5 live Investigates, Mr Haroun said IS used "the boats for their people who they want to send to Europe as the European police don't know who is from IS and who is a normal refugee or not".
The militants often sat separately from the other migrants and were not scared of the crossing, he said, adding that they were "for IS - 100%".
Mr Haroun added that IS allowed boat owners to operate - but demanded a 50% cut of whatever they made from each ship.

He also suggested that the jihadists were planning ahead for future attacks in Europe.
Earlier this year, the EU's border control agency, Frontex, warned that it was "possible" that foreign fighters were using irregular migration routes to get into Europe.
IS - which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria - has been active in recent months in Libya, exploiting a power struggle between rival groups after the fall of Col Muammar Gaddafi.
In March, IS also claimed responsibility for the attack in Tunisia's capital Tunis, in which 22 people were killed.

article A Russian defence ministry statement said the Turkish vessel approached to 600m (1,800ft) before turning away in response to Russian small arms fire.
The Turkish military attache in Moscow has been summoned to the foreign ministry over the incident.
Relations remain tense over Turkey's shooting down of a Russian bomber.
The Russian SU-24 bomber was shot down by two Turkish F-16s in the Turkish border-Syria area on 24 November. Turkey maintained the plane crossed into its airspace, although Russia disputes this.
And last week, Turkey complained over what it said was a sailor on a Russian naval ship brandishing a missile launcher as the vessel passed through Istanbul. Russia rejected the criticism saying the crew had a "legal right" to protect the ship.
24 November - A Turkish F-16 fighter jet shoots down a Russian Su-24 attack aircraft, allegedly because it violated Turkish airspace. Russia denies the claim and insists the aircraft had been in Syrian airspace. A Russian pilot is killed parachuting from the jet, and a Russian marine is killed in a subsequent rescue mission.
28 November - With Turkey refusing to apologise over the incident, Russia announces a package of economic sanctions against Turkey, including restrictions on imports and travel
6 December - Turkey condemns Russian "provocation" after Turkish media publish showing a Russian serviceman holding a rocket launcher aboard a warship passing through the Bosphorus.
13 December - Russia fires "warning shots" at a Turkish fishing vessel that it says was approaching its warship in the Aegean Sea.

In the latest incident, Russia's defence ministry said its frigate Smetlivy was anchored just off the Greek island of Lemnos on Sunday morning when it spotted the Turkish fishing boat heading towards it some 1,000m (3,000ft) away.
"Despite numerous attempts by the crew of the Smetlivy, the crew of the Turkish fishing boat did not make radio contact and did not respond to visual signals by semaphore or warning flares," the ministry said in a statement.
To prevent a collision, "small arms were fired in the direction of the Turkish vessel from a range that is not lethal".
The ministry said that "immediately after that the Turkish vessel drastically changed course" and passed within half a kilometre of the Smetlivy, still making no contact with the Russian crew.
Russia's deputy defence minister has summoned a Turkish military attache, the statement said. Turkey has not yet given its response to the incident.
Russian military vessels are involved in Russia's intervention against rebels in Syria.
President Vladimir Putin described as a "stab in the back" Turkey's downing of the Russian bomber and has imposed economic sanctions.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu warned on Friday that Ankara's patience with Russia was "not unlimited", and accused Moscow of using "every opportunity" to punish Turkey for the downing of the plane.

article The data gets added as employees create documents, images and other files as they maintain and update websites.
The research found user names, employee IDs, software versions and unique IDs for internal computers in the files.
Attackers could use it to craft attacks aimed at senior staff, said security firm Glasswall which did the survey.
Banks, law firms, defence contractors and government departments were all found to be leaking data.
"This is really low-hanging fruit," said Lewis Henderson, a vice-president at Glasswall, which carried out the survey for the BBC.
To gather the data, Mr Henderson "scraped" target websites for days to ensure he grabbed copies of all the files published by an organisation. Pictures, PDFs, spreadsheets and other documents made public via the sites were all sampled.
"This was all done from a single IP [internet protocol] address and in broad daylight," he said.
Mr Henderson said that a significant proportion of the files contained metadata which betrayed key information about the people who created that file, when they did it, and the version of the software and machine which they used. About 99% of one particular document type contained this data.
In some cases, he added, user names were annotated with internal user IDs and, in one case, he found a detailed guide to a remote login procedure for a law firm's Far Eastern regional office.
The cache of data gathered would be a perfect starting point for any sophisticated attack that sought to target senior staff or their aides, said Mr Henderson.
"We did what a malicious actor would do," he said, "which is intelligence gathering on a large scale."
Armed with the information, Mr Henderson said an attacker would then turn to social media, especially Facebook and LinkedIn, to relate the names found buried in the documents to real people.
Emails bearing booby-trapped attachments could then be crafted for specific individuals after studying their biographical details and recent activity.
"The more information you have the more you can customise the package sent to targets," he said.
The virus code that attackers buried in the malicious attachments could lurk until it hit the machine used by a specific person, he said, guaranteeing it reached a particular target.
Chief executives and finance heads were rarely targeted directly, said Mr Henderson. Instead attackers tended to go after their aides who are busy, deal with a lot of different people day-to-day and receive a lot of documents.
"Organisations are always surprised when they get hit by targeted attacks," he said. "They always ask how they found out all that information."
Cleaning up files to strip out useful data was "simple", said Mr Henderson.
"All of them will probably have a policy that says this should not happen," he added. "But although there's a policy, there's not necessarily the due diligence and process to do it."
The techniques used by Glasswall were "absolutely" the same as those seen in sophisticated, customised cyber-attacks, said Rick Holland, vice-president of strategy at security firm Digital Shadows.
"Anyone doing a targeted attack is going to look at all the documents in a firm's public footprint," he said.
Any data on user names gathered from that file sweep would then be compared to the logs derived from recent massive data breaches, he said, adding that this was a technique used by security firms who were under contract to test the digital defences of a company or organisation.
The breach logs might reveal a password associated with a user name that an attacker could use in a bid to take over an account, said Mr Holland.
The recent slew of "mega-breaches" meant there were a lot of user names and passwords available to attackers, he said. One site that gathers breach data, Have I Been Pwned, has amassed data on almost four billion accounts stolen from more than 226 websites.
Firms failed to view the files and documents on their websites as a security risk, he said, because they were focused more on internal threats.
"Many organisations just do not know that the risk is out there," he said. "Few look at the total risk picture of their digital footprint."

article Yet that wasn't the only talking point at the Los Angeles ceremony, which also saw some more light-hearted moments, the odd surprise - and more than one fashion catastrophe.
Here are seven things that grabbed our attention.
The Oscar-winning star of Moulin Rouge turned heads on the red carpet by wearing two of them on her shoulders.
The Australian actress - who was up for an award for her work in Lion - frocked up in a green Gucci gown adorned with feathered parrot heads.
The dress saw her crowned by some media as the worst-dressed star at the event and quickly had people squawking in the Twittersphere.
"Every night in America should end with Nicole Kidman in a bird dress," wrote Vanity Fair columnist Richard Lawson.
Will someone try to top her bold fashion choice at Hollywood's next awards bash? After all, toucan play at that game.
Stranger Things actor David Harbour gave an impassioned speech when the show won its best ensemble award, calling on his fellow "craftsmen and women" to "battle against fear, self-centredness and exclusivity".
But his thunder was stolen somewhat by the facial expressions sported by his co-star Winona Ryder as she stood beside him.
Initially surprised at the weight of her prize statuette, the 45-year-old went on to emote delight, amazement and confusion before raising her fist in what appeared to be a mock salute.
"Next time Trump gives a speech, make Winona Ryder stand next to him and translate for all of us through her facial expressions," wrote the TV critic Emily Nussbaum.
Stranger Things's success came at the expense of another highly regarded sci-fi show that had also begun the evening with three nominations.
The TV makeover of Michael Crichton's Westworld ended up a bridesmaid though, missing out in all three categories in which it was shortlisted.
As well as missing out on the outstanding ensemble in a drama series prize, the show was also pipped to a stuntwork prize by Game of Thrones.
Thandie Newton, meanwhile, had to applaud politely when fellow Brit Claire Foy received the best actress in a drama series award.
But the 44-year-old made light of being passed over, posting a humorous picture on Twitter of herself necking a bottle of champagne.
Even William H Macy was surprised when he beat Transparent's Jeffrey Tambor to the award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series.
"I'm shocked," the Shameless star told the audience. "I'm probably not as shocked as Jeffrey, but I'm pretty shocked."
Macy went on to "thank President Trump for making Frank Gallagher" - the debauched single father he plays in the Showtime TV series - "seem so normal".
Felicity Huffman, Macy's actress wife, tweeted a picture of her own delight at her husband's third SAG win.
Meryl Streep got a shout-out on Sunday from The Crown award-winner John Lithgow, who dedicated part of his acceptance speech to praise her for her much-publicised Trump tirade at the Golden Globes.
"I would like to honour... a great and underrated actress who somehow managed to speak my exact thoughts three weeks ago at another awards ceremony, and that's Meryl Streep," said the 71-year-old.
Streep - who was up for the best actress prize for her role in Florence Foster Jenkins - got additional love after photos were taken of her reaching over to straighten Ryan Gosling's dickie bow.
"Having Miranda Priestly voluntarily fix your outfit is the equivalent of being touched by an angel," gushed In Style's Olivia Bahou - a reference to Streep's magazine editor role in The Devil Wears Prada.
Manchester by the Sea - a cheery tale about a janitor coping with a series of tragic bereavements - had gone into Sunday's awards with the most nominations - four in all.
Yet Kenneth Lonergan's film went away empty-handed when Casey Affleck, Lucas Hedges and Michelle Williams were all beaten in their respective awards categories.
The film also missed out on the outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture prize - the SAG equivalent of a best picture award.
Affleck's failure to win the best actor award - a prize won by Denzel Washington instead - was one of the bigger upsets of the night.
Not everyone was sad to see Ben Affleck's little brother miss out for once following a string of successes at other awards ceremonies. though: "Denzel winning over Casey Affleck at the SAG Awards is the best thing I've heard today," wrote one Twitter user.
Veteran actress Lily Tomlin made a topical reference to "alternative facts" - a phrase that has become common usage since its coinage by top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway - as she collected a lifetime achievement award on Sunday.
"Did you hear the Doomsday Clock has been moved up to two-and-a-half minutes before midnight?" she told a whooping audience at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium.
"This award came just in the nick of time."
The 77-year-old went on to offer such safe words of actorly advice as "don't be anxious about missing an opportunity" and "don't leave the house when you're drunk".
"Live your life so that when you are being honoured for your achievements, the people called upon to make laudatory remarks can feel reasonably honest about their comments,'' she went on.
"Otherwise, in these times, all their words or phrases might be perceived as alternative facts - or worse yet, fake news.''

article Leone Stars will face the Flames at the Siaka Stevens stadium, Freetown, on 22 March, their first match at home since they hosted Seychelles in July 2014.
The match was almost cancelled over a $10,000 fee demanded by the now sacked country's sports minister Paul Kamara.
SLFA told BBC Sport: "We will not pay any cash for the use of the stadium."
This will be the third friendly meetings between Leone Stars and the Flames with the later winning the previous two encounters at home in Lilongwe way back in 1978.
There has never been a competitive fixture between the two teams.
The match is Sierra Leone's preparation for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Gabon - away on 25 March and at home in Freetown three days later.
However, there are no points at stake for the two games because Gabon will host the finals in January.
Sierra Leone are currently bottom of group I behind Sudan and African champions Ivory Coast.
But Malawi are preparing for a competitive Nations Cup double-header with Guinea in Group L.
The Flames are presently third in the table, above Guinea but below Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

article The manager admits the departure of goalkeeper coach Gordon Marshall and Gary Owers came as a shock after the relief of avoiding relegation.
"We'll get a replacement in. That may take a bit of time," he said of Owers' exit after only three months.
"I'm not going to rush into that one because it's a critical area."
Marshall this week switched to Scottish Premiership rivals Aberdeen, while 46-year-old Owers, who managed at Bath, coached at Bristol City and was assistant at both Aldershot and Plymouth Argyle, has become assistant boss at Conference Premier club Gateshead.
Owers and Baraclough had been working on signing targets this summer and the manager said: "A phone call with Gary was one I did not expect, but there was an opportunity for him to get back into coaching and we can't deny him that.
"He has helped set up a recruitment department here that will go from strength to strength.
"Gordon, I only found out about a couple of days ago.
"It comes as a bit of a shock and it's something you don't want to be dealing with going into pre-season.
"But Gordon feels like it is a step up in his career and is going to work with a manager he worked with previously."
Speaking before Motherwell announced the signing of striker David Clarkson, Baraclough admitted that being involved in the play-off final against Rangers had delayed his team building.
"We were probably a couple of weeks, or maybe more than two weeks, behind everyone else because clubs knew what division they were going to be in," he said.
"That won't be used as an excuse whatsoever. We are working feverishly to make things happen.
"We need to add to the group and we are comfortable with the way it is going at the moment."
Lee Erwin switched to Leeds United, John Sutton has moved to St Johnstone, Scott McDonald is out of contract, while 21 other players have exited Fir Park this summer.
Asked about how many will be replaced, Baraclough said: "We're perhaps looking at another five or six at this time.
"We'll wait for the right ones. There's no desperation to get somebody in.
"I'd like to have two players pushing for each position, but that may be within a 20-man pro squad because, for me, you still have to have that pathway for the youngsters to come through.
"The people we are talking to and the targets we've gone for and are continuing to look at, we're comfortable where we are."

article Ex-Soviet army officer Dmitri Kovtun will appear by video-link after he was granted "core participant status" by inquiry chairman, Sir Robert Owen.
Mr Litvinenko died of radioactive poisoning on 23 November 2006.
Mr Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi are suspected of murdering him but both deny involvement and remain in Russia.
It was during a meeting with the pair at a London hotel in November 2006 that Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of the radioactive substance polonium-210.
The 43-year-old had been an officer with the Federal Security Service - the successor to the KGB - but fled to Britain where he became a UK citizen and a fierce critic of the Kremlin.
Mr Kovtun and his colleague Mr Lugovoi initially refused to take part in the inquiry, which opened in January and is sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.
However, in March Mr Kovtun changed his mind and offered to give evidence.
A statement issued by the inquiry on Monday said: "Sir Robert Owen, chairman of the Litvinenko Inquiry, has designated Mr Dmitri Kovtun as a core participant to the Inquiry, pursuant to rules 5(2)(a) and (c) of the Inquiry Rules 2006.
"Sir Robert is satisfied that Mr Kovtun has complied in full with his directions dated 2 April 2015."
The statement also said that Mr Kovtun "does intend to assert the privilege against self-incrimination".

article Kerry Gillespie, now 36, said she had gone with two friends to watch Celtic footballers training in the east end of Glasgow.
They spotted the body of Derek Sheerin on waste ground behind the Celtic social club, near the club's stadium.
She was giving evidence at the trial of Philip Morrison, 40, who denies murdering Mr Sheerin in September 1994.
It is alleged that Mr Morrison, from Londonderry, compressed Mr Sheerin's neck with a belt and robbed him of a watch, tobacco and Â£20.
Ms Gillespie said that on the 25 September, she and her friends were walking in single file, with her at the front, when she saw the body.
She was asked by prosecutor Iain McSporran: "What did you do when you saw the body?"
"I screamed and ran back," she told the High Court in Glasgow.
Ms Gillespie said she ran towards two men who were walking on a path from London Road towards the River Clyde.
One of the men, 49-year-old Duncan Innes, said he had been walking to nearby allotments with a friend.
After being approached by the girls, he went to look at the half-naked body before calling police.
He described seeing papers scattered around the body.
Asked by Mr McSporran what he thought had happened, he said: "I thought maybe it was a sex thing went wrong. Two guys having sex a certain way and it has gone wrong."
The court also heard a statement from James Grayson, the first police officer on the scene, who is no longer alive.
Mr Grayson said he responded to a call at 11:30 on 26 September, 1994.
In his statement, he said: "Due to the distressed condition of the young girls I put them in the rear of my van.
"I went and saw a man's body. A belt was around his neck, his trousers were at his ankles and papers were scattered around."
The trial before judge Lady Rae continues.

article The pioneering Scot was selected despite finishing second to Thomas Telford in a public vote.
Bank chiefs made the decision after concerns were raised about a flurry of last-minute votes for the engineer.
Somerville, who died in 1872,  will feature on new polymer notes which are expected to be issued in the second half of 2017.
The Jedburgh-born woman was one of three historical figures in the running to appear on the notes.
An RBS spokesman said she was the clear favourite of voters during the most of the week-long poll, which was run on the bank's Facebook page.
However there was a sudden surge in activity on the final day of voting, which pushed Telford into first place.
It is understood that fewer than 1,000 votes separated the top two - but very few of Telford's votes were made in the UK.
Physicist James Clerk Maxwell was in third place at the end of the poll.
Malcolm Buchanan, chairman of RBS's Scotland board, said he was overwhelmed by the response to the initiative.
"Having the opportunity to choose the face of our new £10 notes obviously meant a great deal to a great number of people," he added.
"Any of our final nominees would have been worthy winners and we wanted to make sure that our choice properly reflected the wishes of those who took part.
"Mary Somerville's immense contribution to science and her determination to succeed against all the odds clearly resonate as much today as they did during her lifetime."
Somerville made history when she was jointly nominated to be the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1835.
Her writing influenced James Clerk Maxwell and John Couch Adams, who later discovered Neptune.

Kirstie Gordon took 2-39 from her 10 overs at Colombo's Mercantile Cricket Association Ground, with Katie McGill and Abbi Aitken grabbing a wicket apiece.
South Africa next play Bangladesh, who are also Scotland's next opponents on Friday.
In Wednesday's other Group B game, Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 67 runs, while in Group A, Ireland were thrashed by Sri Lanka, and India won a low-scoring game after bowling Thailand out for 55.
The top three teams in each group progress to the Super Six stage, from which the top four qualify for the World Cup, which takes place in England this summer.

article The 4-6 favourite, an impressive winner of last season's Cheltenham Novice Chase, had to work hard to hold off the 16-1 runner-up by half a length.
Foxrock (10-1) was a further half a length back after an exciting finish.
Jockey Bryan Cooper allowed Don Poli to drift on the run-in but a stewards' inquiry left the result unchanged.
The stewards checked whether Don Poli's edging towards the rails had hampered the Ted Walsh-trained Foxrock but the placings remained unaltered.
Despite his domination of Irish National Hunt racing, Mullins had never won the Christmas Leopardstown highlight, but he had a three-strong challenge in Monday's six-runner field as he also saddled On His Own and Sir Des Champs.
On His Own cut out much of the running in the soft conditions with the help of Foxrock but Don Poli closed right up on that pair approaching the final fence.
As On His Own weakened and Don Poli forged ahead, veteran First Lieutenant began to stay on in the hands of Davy Russell.
Running in the race for the fourth time, it briefly looked as if First Lieutenant might catch the favourite but the line came just in time for Cooper's mount.
Bookmakers Paddy Power were not impressed and pushed Don Poli out from 4-1 to 6-1 for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March.
Mullins' second favourite St Des Champs was never a factor as he finished a distant fifth but the trainer was content after breaking his duck in the Leopardstown race.
"It's hard to know how good he (Don Poli) is and how much more he has to produce but I was very happy," said Mullins.
"Bryan said he thought he was in trouble going to the last but he picked up again when they came and went on again."

article Eurosceptics campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union are keen to dismiss the idea that the move would leave the country economically isolated and bereft of trade alliances.
They point out that the UK's links with the 53-nation Commonwealth, composed mainly of territories that belonged to the former British Empire, predate its membership of the EU.
And the Commonwealth itself is eager to stress the trade advantages that its members enjoy by virtue of belonging to the association.
As it opens its 24th summit in the Maltese capital, Valletta, which runs from 27 to 29 November, its place in the global trade landscape is a topic high on the agenda.
But even while continuing to be an EU member, the UK is already making great efforts to trade with the Commonwealth's most dynamic economies - and it is unclear how these efforts would be enhanced by a Brexit.
Meanwhile, at least one influential senior Commonwealth figure from outside the UK argues that the country has no need to choose between the EU and the Commonwealth - it can have both.
With the eurozone currently beset by economic troubles, some commentators feel that the UK should turn away from its stagnating neighbours in favour of broader global trade pacts.
They are assisted in this view by statistics such as those produced by the organisation World Economics, which has a growth tracker showing that the Commonwealth has already overtaken the eurozone in its share of world economic output.
"The Commonwealth accounts for 2.6% more than the eurozone in terms of world GDP share," states World Economics. "Economic growth in the Commonwealth has accelerated over the post-1973 period in sharp contrast to the EU."
However, such comparisons can be misleading, since the Commonwealth is far from being a unified or homogenous bloc.
As the Commonwealth's own website says, "Our countries span Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific and are diverse - they are amongst the world's largest, smallest, richest and poorest countries.
"Thirty-one of our members are classified as small states - countries with a population size of 1.5 million people or less and larger member states that share similar characteristics with them."
For instance, when anti-EU campaigners talk of boosting trade with the Commonwealth, it's a safe bet that they're not talking about Vanuatu, a Pacific Ocean island chain with a population of 246,000.
The country was due to host the next Commonwealth summit in 2017, but was devastated by Cyclone Pam in March of this year, meaning that leaders in Malta will have to decide on another venue for the event.
In fact, just six Commonwealth countries account for more than four-fifths of all trade conducted by the organisation's members. Apart from the UK, they are Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia and Singapore.
As things stand, the UK isn't exactly giving any of these countries the cold shoulder. Earlier this month, the UK and India signed commercial deals worth Â£9bn during a visit to London by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - a visit seen as giving an important boost to the UK's relations with the world's fastest-growing large economy.
Other big Commonwealth economies are not badly placed either. Some Conservative MPs, including Boris Johnson, feel that the UK "betrayed" countries such as Australia when it joined the EU in 1973, but the Australian government doesn't seem to see it that way.
"We share an extensive economic, trade and investment relationship," says the Australian government website's country brief on UK relations, before going on to list the evidence.
Investment is particularly strong: the UK is "the second-largest source of total and direct foreign investment in Australia", while Australia returns the favour, with the UK also being "Australia's second most important foreign investment destination".
For its part, the Commonwealth stresses that countries benefit economically from belonging to the club. According to its Trade Review 2015, members' combined exports of goods and services amounted to $3.4 trillion in 2013, "which is about 15% of the world's total exports".
"When both bilateral partners are Commonwealth members, they tend to trade 20% more, and generate 10% more foreign direct investment inflows than otherwise," says the review.
"This 'Commonwealth effect' implies bilateral trade costs between Commonwealth partners are on average 19% lower compared with those for other country peers."
So the Commonwealth does seem to confer economic benefits on its members. However, senior Commonwealth figures don't see that as a reason for the UK to leave the EU.
One task of the Malta summit will be to choose the Commonwealth's next secretary-general, the sixth person to hold the post.
One of the three candidates currently in the running, veteran Caribbean diplomat Sir Ronald Sanders, has argued that there is no need for the UK to choose between the two alliances.
"Increased trade with Commonwealth countries is perfectly possible for Britain," he wrote in 2013. "It does not have to shed itself of Europe for that to happen."
As Sir Ronald points out, the EU is still the largest single market for UK exports, accounting for more than 40% of the total.
In his view, the goal for the Commonwealth is to work to "bring more Commonwealth countries into the gains of increased trade" by helping them to tackle their structural failings - something that heads of government could do well to reflect on as they gather in Valletta.

article The country had been declared Ebola-free more than seven weeks ago.
The new case was in Nedowein, the same village where the boy died, the ministry of information said.
Liberia's authorities quarantined the area after the teenager's death and said his funeral was carried out safely.
The BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia says the man who tested positive for Ebola did not live with the teenager who died, and has been moved to a treatment centre.
Health official Cestus Tarpeh told AFP news agency that the person had been in physical contact with the 17-year-old before his death.
He added that a herbalist who had treated the boy had evaded the authorities and was on the run.
It is not clear how the teenager who died was infected.
There has been some confusion over the number of new cases after Liberia's Ministry of Information tweeted "2 persons from the home of 17yrs-old #ebola victim diagnosed & confirmed #Ebola positive".
People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.
More than 11,000 people have died of the disease since December 2013, the vast majority of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

article Saints needed maximum points from their final Pool Three game to stay in with a chance of progressing as one of the best three runners-up.
And they did it with ease, thanks to tries from Harry Mallinder, George Pisi, Sam Dickinson and George North.
Rhodri Jones grabbed a late consolation score for the hosts.
Bottom side Scarlets had nothing left to play for in the competition and they were soon behind as 19-year-old Mallinder, son of director of rugby Jim, intercepted a loose Scarlets pass and sprinted home.
Saints struck again eight minutes later as Pisi went over in the corner, before Aled Thomas slotted the hosts' first points from the tee to make it 12-3 at the break.
Dickinson claimed a simple touchdown after the restart and Scarlets' woes continued when lock Maselino Paulino was yellow-carded for a shoulder barge on England's Courtney Lawes.
Wales international North secured the important bonus point when he crossed the line after a brilliant pass from Mallinder.
Saints finished with 14 men after replacement scrum-half Lee Dickson was sin-binned for a technical offence, and it gave Jones the chance to touch down at the death.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac: "We wanted to be in the game, and over the 80 minutes we put in a solid performance.
"It was a big step up from last week."
Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder:  "It's always a challenge, particularly to get the four tries, so we are delighted to get the bonus point.
"We knew that whatever team Scarlets put out they would be fighting. We can sit back and hope that results go our way on Sunday.
"Not getting any bonus point wins has made it difficult for us and made it close, but to win four and draw one is pretty good."

article But she found that somehow Irish affairs demanded her attention, helped to define the age she dominated and were to play a role in determining how history remembers her.
Republicans saw her as an enemy from the very start.
In the months before she took office, an INLA car bomb killed her close political ally Airey Neave as he drove out of the underground car park at the Palace of Westminster.
Neave, a former intelligence officer who once escaped from the Nazi prison camp at Colditz, believed in taking much tougher security measures against republican paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.
It was a view that fitted in with Mrs Thatcher's own and may well have helped to shape it.
The great irony of her period in office is that she managed to alienate unionists too, even though she will probably turn out to be the last prime minister of the UK to have had old-fashioned unionist instincts.
She was always ready to point out that the official title of the party she led was "Conservative and Unionist" - just as she was herself.
This was a woman to whom Northern Ireland was every bit as British as her Finchley constituency.
Whatever narrative thread you follow through her years in office - radical economic change, her struggle with trade unionism, or the battle for the Falklands and the fallout from that - events in Ireland are always there in the background.
As she was settling into office, a series of IRA murders claimed the Queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten and killed 18 British soldiers in a single day.
The Troubles were at their height, and in Margaret Thatcher the IRA found an implacable foe.
She was convinced that any settlement would have to include a decisive and lasting victory for the security forces over the IRA.
It was the hunger strike in 1981 which defined her attitude towards republican violence.
Inside the Maze Prison complex near Lisburn in County Antrim, republican paramilitary prisoners were engaged in a long campaign to secure a set of privileges which would, in effect, have given them prisoner-of-war status.
It was a dispute that went to the heart of The Troubles - were imprisoned members of the IRA terrorist murderers, or guerrilla fighters whose actions in pursuit of their cause were legitimate?
Margaret Thatcher was in no doubt.
"Crime is crime is crime. It is not political," she said, as the republican prisoners, one by one, starved themselves to death.
To her supporters, it was exactly the kind of uncompromising stand on a matter of principle that made her great.
To many in Ireland, it was a display of brutal inflexibility that the deaths of 10 of the hunger strikers over a period of months did nothing to soften.
She became a figure of hate to Irish republicans - and in 1984 they tried, with devastating consequences, to assassinate her.
An IRA bomb exploded at the Conservative Party conference in Brighton, killing four delegates and seriously injuring many others.
But Mrs Thatcher survived - and so did her unwavering determination to give the security forces the political support and the equipment they needed to crush republican terrorism.
To persuade the Irish government in Dublin to improve security co-operation and extradition arrangements, she signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.
It was a curious step, which she took against her own political instincts, as it enshrined the right of the Irish Republic to a role in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
Unionists in the province, who should have been natural allies of Margaret Thatcher, were furious and began a campaign of street protests to attempt to overthrow the agreement.
Mrs Thatcher, already a figure of hate to one side in Northern Ireland, had now alienated the other.
The Anglo-Irish Agreement was a substantial political achievement in many ways and helped to pave the way for the improved relationships that eventually gave birth to the peace process.
But it was not an achievement of which Margaret Thatcher was proud - in her memoirs she wrote of how she had been misled about the likely extent of unionist anger it would provoke.
The events of 1987 summed up the atmosphere of the Thatcher years in Northern Ireland.
In May, British SAS commandos shot dead eight IRA members at Loughgall in County Armagh as they set out to ambush two officers in a sleepy part-time rural police station.
Six months later, 11 civilians were killed when a no-warning IRA bomb exploded as they gathered for a Remembrance Day service at Enniskillen in County Fermanagh.
Mrs Thatcher's belief in the use of tough tactics never wavered - in 1988 she introduced a broadcasting ban which made it illegal to broadcast the views of the likes of Sinn Fein, "to deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity on which they thrive".
That, remember, is just 10 years before one of her successors signed the Good Friday Agreement - a document which made it British policy to create political institutions where Sinn Fein would share power with Northern Ireland's other main political parties.
Mrs Thatcher, it was clear, was not enthusiastic about the messy political compromises that the peace process required.
She once said that she did not see why one should make concessions in order to persuade people to honour commitments they had already given - a phrase that might almost describe the approach to peace-making of the administrations that followed her.
But we cannot judge politicians by the standards of other ages; only by the standards of the ages in which they lived and governed.
In Irish affairs Margaret Thatcher was a tough and uncompromising believer in the Union, and instinctively loyal to the security forces she saw as society's bulwark against a slide into the anarchy of terrorism.
She was hated by republicans and despised them in return, and her blunt-speaking style won her few friends on either side of the border, even if many had a sneaking admiration for her status on the world stage.
If it never seemed likely that British policy would be overturned by violence on her watch, it never seemed likely either that the path to a more peaceful overall solution would be found.

article BBC Sport pundits and former champions Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon reflect on the action so far and assess the business end of the event.
Pre-tournament favourite Judd Trump was beaten in the first round by 1000-1 title shot Rory McLeod in one of the biggest shocks in World Championship history. In his second-round match against Stephen Maguire, McLeod is 6-2 down after the first session.
Ebdon: "McLeod's victory was not so much of a shock or a surprise to me. I knew he would make it difficult for Trump and let us not underestimate what an incredible achievement it was for him, one that was fully deserved.
"There is only one player in that game that works harder than McLeod and that is Mark Selby, who is world number one. Rory has been my friend for over 30 years so I was absolutely delighted for him."
Hendry: "It has been an interesting tournament. All the main contenders except for Trump came through the first round so it is building up nicely.
"Everyone who should make the quarter-finals will be there so I am looking forward to the second week."
Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan has produced some of his best snooker to beat Gary Wilson and then Shaun Murphy. He faces China's number one player Ding Junhui in the next round.
Hendry: "Ronnie has looked great on the table. I questioned in my interviews before the tournament whether he could win it or not and the way he was playing then, I did not think he could.
"He has not played well since the Masters but since he has been here he has looked really focussed, his game is very strong and he will be hard to stop. Ronnie is definitely one to beat.
"There is a difference between winning a match and winning the whole tournament. Ding edged through by beating Liang Wenbo but now has a huge match against O'Sullivan. You have to question whether he has it inside him to go all the way. That is debatable but his game is good enough. He has every aspect to do it."
Ebdon: "One of the things often overlooked is the pressure O'Sullivan is under, with the levels of expectation - the crowd, the commentators, millions of adoring fans watching at home.
"To carry that much pressure on your shoulders must be incredibly difficult and I cannot think of many other players in the game that could carry the mantle and the responsibility to the extent he does.
"He does a brilliant job, is a very gifted player and it was an excellent win against Shaun Murphy."
Four-time champion John Higgins came through a tough match against Mark Allen, while 25-year-old Kyren Wilson beat 2015 winner Stuart Bingham.
Ebdon: "Wilson did not hit top gear, he was feeling the pressure but that is what everyone goes through at the Crucible. Once he starts hitting the top gears, we will see something very special from him.
"Whether he has the experience to win this year, I am not certain. But he is good enough. He is a phenomenal talent, a great lad and his all-round game is very impressive.
"He is one of the best players I have played against. But we have not seen on the match table what I see in practice. He could go very close to winning it this year."
Hendry: "John Higgins is going to be very difficult to stop getting to the final. If they both go through, I can see a Higgins against Barry Hawkins semi-final."
The tournament is described as the "marathon of the mind" by former BBC commentator Clive Everton. Those players who have reached the quarter-finals have won 23 frames but still need to claim another 48 to lift the famous trophy.
Ebdon: "When you are concentrating so hard, it takes an awful lot out of you, you do use up a lot of nervous energy. We only have so much nervous energy for certain periods of time.
"This is one the reasons why the World Championship at the Crucible - lasting 17 days - is such a difficult and demanding tournament to win. You are really tested in all departments - physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It is the ultimate test."

article A judge made the ruling last month.
A case had been taken by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission against the Department of Justice.
The judge said there should be exemptions in the law for women who were the victims of sexual crime and in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
He said the current legal provisions in Northern Ireland breached the European Convention on Human Rights.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply to Northern Ireland, where abortions are illegal except where the life or mental health of the mother is in danger.
Anyone who unlawfully carries out an abortion could be jailed for life.
The judge's ruling did not change the law but had placed an onus on the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate on the issue.
John Larkin QC, the attorney general, said at the time he was "profoundly disappointed" by the decision and was considering the grounds for appeal.
Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, said it would resist any attempt to overturn the judge's ruling.
Its Northern Ireland director, Patrick Corrigan, said: "The assembly must bring Northern Ireland's abortion laws into the 21st Century and into line with international law as a matter of urgency."

article Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham made the call following the Hillsborough Inquests, which concluded police blunders caused the tragedy.
He said it was a scandal police officers could retire on full pensions and evade misconduct proceedings.
The Home Office said there is provision for disciplining retired officers in the Policing and Crime Bill.
Labour plans to add its proposals as amendments to be tabled to the bill next month.
Mr Burnham said the party believed families should receive the same level of funding for legal representation as police at inquests involving officers.
And after concerns about the way journalists were fed information by some South Yorkshire Police officers  he has called for a ban on off-the record briefings to reporters during investigations.
He said: "It is impossible to say how much harm was caused by those malicious briefings which led to the front page in The Sun that blamed Liverpool supporters."
The paper's infamous and discredited front page on the Monday after the tragedy bore the headline "The Truth", with claims that fans picked the pockets of the dead, urinated on police and beat up an officer administering first aid.
Mr Burnham added some police officers were able to get away with these "malicious lies" because they were communicated anonymously.
He also called for the second stage of Lord Leveson's inquiry into media ethics to proceed with a focus on police and press relations.
Last month a jury concluded that 96 football fans were unlawfully killed and police blunders "caused or contributed to" the 1989 disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-Final at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield.
Mr Burnham said: "The Hillsborough families have walked the hardest road imaginable over those 27 years, and that journey has exposed just how unfair this country is, just how the odds are stacked against people and loaded in favour of the authorities.
"Hillsborough must mark a moment of real change - when Parliament resolves to rebalance the police and criminal justice system and put more power in the hands of ordinary people."
He added: "Never again should any bereaved families have to fight like the Hillsborough families have had to fight."
Mr Burnham, who led the Parliamentary campaign on behalf of the Hillsborough families, said he hoped to enlist cross-party support.
"We must call time on the uneven playing field at inquests where public bodies spend public money like water on hiring the best lawyers when ordinary families have to scratch around for whatever they can get.
"Public money should be spent on helping us get to the truth, not on protecting the public sector."
Labour's proposed amendments to the Policing and Crime Bill in the Commons also include:
He added: "After the Hillsborough verdict, Parliament has an unprecedented moment where it can act to rebalance the country in favour of ordinary families."
His call comes on the day Hillsborough Family Support Group chairwoman Margaret Aspinall will speak to MPs about her personal experience of the police and the criminal justice system over the last 27 years.
A Home Office spokesman said: "As the Home Secretary told the House of Commons, lessons must be learnt from the ordeals gone through by families. That is why she has asked Bishop James Jones to write a report to ensure the perspectives of families are not lost."
summary The government should scrap the retirement age for police officers who died in the Hillsborough disaster.

article The French Open, US Open and Australian Open just take the ATP rankings, but Wimbledon works it out differently to favour players who are better on grass.
The seedings are important because a highly seeded player cannot meet another highly seeded player until late in the tournament.
Wimbledon takes the points used to calculate a player's ATP ranking, doubles the points earned at grass tournaments in the past year and adds on 75% of the points earned on grass the previous year.
The ladies singles system is different in that a committee decides whether the WTA rankings need changing. No changes were made for 2017. A seeding committee was also used for the men's competition until 2002.
How much difference does it make?
If you compare the top eight seeds in the men's singles for the last five years with the players at the top of the ATP rankings one week before the tournament each year, there have only been two or three changes each year.
Over that five year period you could classify five of the changes as being "good" in that they make the seeding a better predictor of the outcomes and three of them as "bad" because they make it a worse predictor.
The highest profile example came in 2014, when Novak Djokevic was made number one seed at Wimbledon, despite being number two on the ATP rankings. Mr Djokevic won the tournament while Rafael Nadal, who was demoted to the number two slot, was knocked out in the fourth round.
On the other hand, in 2012 Tomas Berdych was promoted above David Ferrer in the seedings and was knocked out in the first round while David Ferrer reached the quarter-finals.
It also must be taken into account that changing seedings is partly a self-fulfilling policy, because a higher-seeded player is likely to get further in the tournament as a result of playing lower-ranked players.
Over the past five years, there have been four "bad" changes in the top eight seeds and three "good" changes, so the Wimbledon seeding method has been marginally worse on that measure than just using the ATP rankings, but there is not a lot in it.
To find out whether it has been a better predictor than seedings at other grand slams Reality Check compared the seedings with the outcomes for the top eight seeds in grand slams from 2012 to 2016.
The outcomes allocate a numerical value for the stage at which a player is knocked out, for example, a player knocked out in the semi-finals gets a value of three or four because he could have come either third or fourth. Similarly, someone knocked out in in the first round would get a value of 96.5.
If the seeding system was perfect then adding up the outcomes for the top eight seeds in a single year would give a total of 36 (one + two + 3.5 + 3.5 + four lots of 6.5).
In fact, the average number you get for the last five years at Wimbledon is 146.
That is considerably higher than the figures of 106 at the US Open, 93 at the French Open and 89 at the Australian Open.
First of all, it should be said that all of these numbers are pretty high. There is not a strong correlation between seeding and outcome.
Nonetheless, it is much worse an indicator at Wimbledon. It would be tempting to conclude that was because the seeding system is different, but we have already established that the changes made only make a marginal difference.
That means that Wimbledon must just have been a less predictable tournament over the past five years than the other grand slams.

article Work has also ended on versions of its software that was designed to run on smartphones and laptops.
Ubuntu said it took the decision because the project had failed to win over users and industry partners.
Instead, it said, it would concentrate on code for cloud services and internet-of-things devices.
The Linux open source operating system exists in lots of different versions or "distributions" that share the same source code but often have a different interface laid on top. Unity aimed to be a graphical front-end suitable for lots of different devices.
Canonical, which makes the popular Ubuntu distribution of the Linux open source software, started the Unity project in 2011. The ultimate idea was to produce software that ran on large and small devices and could be used the same way on all of them.
The Unity project also aimed to let smartphones act as a desktop machine when combined with other devices such as docking stations.
However, said Canonical boss Mark Shuttleworth in a blog, although Unity tried to end some of the fragmentation in the open source world it actually ended up contributing to it.
In addition, he said, few people had bought phones or laptops that ran the Ubuntu/Unity combination and few laptop makers were offering the software as an option.
Mr Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu would switch back to the default user interface for Linux - known as Gnome - in April 2018.
He said the decision to end Unity had been "very difficult" because he believed strongly in ways to make it easier to use Linux anywhere and everywhere and because of the time he had spent with the developers working on it.
"We feel like a family, but this choice is shaped by commercial constraints and those two are hard to reconcile," he said.
summary Ubuntu has announced it will stop developing its desktop operating system for the Mac.

article The authors of a new study say there was a 48% fall in planned coal units, with a 62% drop in construction starts.
The report, from several green campaign groups, claims changing policies and economic conditions in China and India were behind the decline.
However, the coal industry argues the fuel will remain essential to economic growth in Asia for decades to come.
Between 2006 and 2016, India and China together accounted for 85% of the coal plants built around the world.
But according to the Boom and Bust 2017 report, put together by Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and CoalSwarm, there has been a huge swing away from coal in these two countries in just 12 months.
The main causes of the decline are the imposition of restrictive measures by China's central government - with the equivalent of 600 coal-fired units being put on hold until at least 2020.
The Indian go-slow was prompted, according to the authors, by the reluctance of banks to provide funds. Work at 13 locations is currently not going ahead.
However, there have also been significant retirements of coal plants in Europe and the US over the past two years, with roughly 120 large units being taken out of commission.
"This has been a messy year, and an unusual one," said Ted Nace, director of CoalSwarm.
"It's not normal to see construction frozen at scores of locations, but central authorities in China and bankers in India have come to recognize overbuilding of coal plants as a major waste of resources.
"However abrupt, the shift from fossil fuels to clean sources in the power sector is a positive one for health, climate security, and jobs. And by all indications, the shift is unstoppable."
The study comes as other groups analyse the potential for investments in coal to become stranded assets if governments continue to restrict CO2 emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that hundreds of billions of dollars could be at risk.
"The decline in new coal plants in Asian countries is truly dramatic, and shows how a perfect storm of factors is simply making coal a bad investment," said Paul Massara, now of North Star Solar but a former CEO of RWE npower.
"Growing awareness of the air pollution problems coal causes, the impact of policies to tackle climate change, and the rapid growth and cost-competitiveness of renewable sources of energy, along with emerging battery technologies, are making new coal plants redundant before they are even built," he said.
However, the World Coal Association vehemently disagrees. It says the complexity of large infrastructure projects means that until they break ground, it's no surprise if they don't go ahead.
"Yes, China, is reducing the number of coal-stations but not because it's transitioning away from coal. Instead, the new dynamics is a signal of a more developed economy," said Benjamin Sporton.
"Contrary to the picture being portrayed by certain quarters, China's climate pledge suggests that coal will continue to be central to its energy solutions, albeit through efficiencies including the use of new coal technologies.
"In India's case, it's simply not true that renewables are displacing coal. The International Energy Agency has said that India's coal demand will see the biggest growth over next five years with an annual average growth rate of 5% by 2021.
"For these countries, excluding coal from the energy mix is not an option; it is essential for economic growth and critical in securing energy access."
According to the authors of the study, the slowdown brings the possibility of keeping global warming under 2 degrees C since pre-industrial times "within feasible reach."
However, the study says that much more progress needs to be made to reduce the number of coal-fired plants under development in Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, Japan and elsewhere.

article The suicide bomber died and three embassy employees, all Kyrgyz nationals, were injured, Deputy PM Zhenish Razakov said.
China's foreign ministry condemned the bombing as an "extreme and violent attack".
No-one has yet said they were behind the suicide bombing.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: "China is appalled and strongly condemns the violent act."
She said China had "demanded that Kyrgyz authorities take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel in Kyrgyzstan, launch a thorough investigation to find out the truth of the incident and harshly punish the perpetrators".
The vehicle reportedly smashed through the gates and exploded in the centre of the compound, close to the ambassador's residence.
Social media footage showed smoke billowing above the building.
"As a result of the explosion, only the suicide bomber terrorist died," Mr Razakov told journalists.
The three injured people were reportedly two 17-year-old embassy gardeners and an unidentified woman.
The chief of security at the Chinese embassy told the local AKIpress news agency that no Chinese were hurt.
As well as Chinese embassy employees, staff at the American embassy nearby were evacuated.
Kyrgyz security officials are at the scene conducting an investigation into the blast, which came a day before the nation marks its Independence Day.
Kyrgyz authorities conducted several anti-terrorism operations in Bishkek in 2015.
Officials say that some 500 Kyrgyz nationals are believed to have joined so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
One of the three men who carried out an attack on Istanbul's Ataturk airport in June was said to be from Kyrgyzstan. The suicide gun and bomb attack, which Turkey blamed on IS jihadists, left 44 people dead and 240 injured.
Chinese have been targeted in Kyrgyzstan in the past, including in 2000 when one official was shot dead in an attack blamed on Uighurs, who form a restive population of China's western Xinjiang province.
Kyrgyz border guards killed 11 people believed to be members of a Uighur anti-Chinese militant group after they were said to have illegally crossed the border in 2014.
In its travel advice to Kyrgyzstan, the UK government warns of an underlying threat from terrorism.
It says there has been some terrorist activity and armed violence, particularly south and west of the city of Osh.

article Mr Trump began a trip to Israel on Monday by saying that it shared a "common cause" with its Arab neighbours in "the threat posed by Iran".
He also demanded that Iran cease its support of "terrorists and militias".
Mr Rouhani dismissed the criticism and said it was actually Iran and its allies that were fighting terrorists.
Iran and the US back opposing sides in the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, but they are both fighting the jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq.
Speaking after meeting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, Mr Trump said the US and Israel faced "common threats - from [IS] and other terrorist groups, to countries like Iran that sponsor terrorism and fund and foment terrible violence".
"The United States and Israel can declare with one voice that Iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon, and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias," he added.
Mr Trump's comments came a day after he urged Arab and Muslim leaders at a speech at a summit in Saudi Arabia to "work together to isolate Iran" unless it is "willing to be a partner for peace".
Speaking at his first news conference since winning a second term in Friday's presidential election in Iran, Mr Rouhani dismissed the summit as "just a show".
"Who can say regional stability can be restored without Iran? Who can say the region will experience total stability without Iran?" he asked.
Mr Rouhani, a moderate cleric who signed a nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, said the US had "resorted to many methods against Iran but failed in all".
"We are waiting for the new US administration to find stability and continuity in its policies," he added.
"The problem is that the Americans do not know our region and those who advise US officials are misleading them."
Mr Rouhani stressed that it was Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians and members of Lebanon's Hezbollah movement who had been fighting terrorists in the Middle East in recent years, and accused the US and its allies of funding terrorists.
Mr Rouhani also said Iran would continue its ballistic missile programme, which has been heavily criticised by the Trump administration.
"The Iranian nation has decided to be powerful. Our missiles are for peace and for defence," he said. "American officials should know that whenever we need to technically test a missile, we will do so and will not wait for their permission."

article Ricky Hayden, 27, was stabbed in Romford, east London, as he confronted machete-wielding youths with his father and brother, the Old Bailey heard.
Tommy Roome said he "pulled the knife out" when he saw Paul Hayden had a bat but never meant serious harm.
Mr Roome denies Mr Hayden's murder and the attempted murder of his father.
Tarrell Hinds denies the same charges.
The court heard the men had gone to Gibbfield Close on 13 September last year to look for two brothers, Carter and Latham Jordan, who Mr Roome was involved in an ongoing dispute with.
Giving evidence, Mr Roome said they had stopped as they thought they saw one of the Jordans' cars when he spotted three men running down the road.
He told jurors he only put his hand on the handle of his knife when he saw Paul Hayden had a baseball bat.
"He was trying to hit me. I pulled the knife out of the case. I got hit," he said.
He said he was not aware he had hit Paul Hayden and insisted he never intended to try to kill him or do him really serious harm.
"There was just blood in the road. I panicked and ran down the road," he told jurors.
The Old Bailey heard Mr Roome then could not restart the moped so he took a pedal bike which one of his friends had been riding and left.
He told the jury he later stashed the knife in a bin shed and disposed of the bike and a bloodied jumper he was wearing.
Mr Roome, also known as Aaron and from Chadwell Heath, and Mr Hinds, who is nicknamed Ghost and from Chigwell, also face an alternative charge of wounding Paul Hayden with intent.
Both deny all charges.
The trial continues.

article Russian state media reported that the USS Ross was acting "aggressively".
The US Department of Defense, however, said the ship was "well within international waters at all times, performing routine operations".
The US Navy released video on Monday of a Russian plane passing as close as 500 metres to the USS Ross.
"The crew of the ship acted provocatively and aggressively, which concerned the operators of monitoring stations and ships of the Black Sea Fleet," according to a military source quoted by Russian state media.
"Su-24 attack aircraft demonstrated to the American crew readiness to harshly prevent a violation of the frontier and to defend the interests of the country."
Pentagon spokesman Col Steve Warren said on Monday that the Russian planes were not armed with weapons and the USS Ross maintained its course.
The ship's deployment to the Black Sea had been publicly announced, the Pentagon added.
Russia's Defence Ministry would not comment on the reports.
The Black Sea encounters are the latest sign of military tension between Russian and the West, amid hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
Last month, the UK and Sweden scrambled fighters to intercept Russian bombers near their borders.

article The team announced on Thursday that Button will be staying with them for 2016 and Mansell said the news was "brilliant for Honda, brilliant for McLaren and brilliant for Jenson".
McLaren have struggled badly in 2015 and are ninth out of 10 teams in the constructors' championship.
"Jenson deserves an opportunity to see if they can compete and win next year," the 1992 world champion told BBC Sport.
"I think this winter Honda can make a breakthrough and McLaren will be working so, so hard. They are a fantastic team.
"They've won so much in the past and, to use [McLaren chairman] Ron Dennis's words, they will win again in the future. I have no doubt about that."
Button, the 2009 world champion, and team-mate Fernando Alonso, who took the title in 2005 and 2006, have both expressed their frustration in recent races at the lack of performance from the McLaren and, particularly, the down-on-power Honda engine.
The 35-year-old Briton's future had been in doubt while Spaniard Alonso, who described his car as "embarrassing" during Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix, said afterwards he "didn't know" whether he would be racing in F1 next year.
Mansell said "they are quite right to express their frustration" but urged McLaren's drivers to "stay the course" as "both have enormous ability to win further World Championships".
He added: "Between Alonso and Jenson they will be a formidable team, given the car and the engine to do the job.
"When you go through the growing pains, and I've been there a few times myself, stay the course because they could have the best team and best engine and they'll have some really serious regrets if Honda get it right after they've gone somewhere else.
"Hopefully within 12 months they'll be singing the praises of the team and Honda. I sincerely hope they'll be winning races in a year's time."
Mansell joined McLaren in 1995, aged 41, as they were starting a new engine partnership with Mercedes, which lasted until 2014 and brought the team three drivers' titles and one constructors' championship.
The Briton was forced to miss the first two grands prix of the season as the car did not fit him and after returning for two uncompetitive races, Mansell decided to quit McLaren and retire from F1.
He says now he was wrong to do so and should have stayed at McLaren to help improve the car.
"I have to say, unequivocally, that given the same set of circumstances what I should have done, and didn't do, is sit in the office for a day or so to have a good chat with Ron Dennis. He would have helped me enormously and the chances are I wouldn't have stood down at that time," he said.
"That's why I give this advice to everybody now to think very carefully."
Mansell used Honda engines from 1985-87 when he drove for Williams and says the Japanese manufacturer is "going through the same challenges" they experienced when joining Formula 1 in that decade.
He added: "I believe that if the iron will is there, which I've witnessed before from McLaren and Honda, they will get it right."
Mansell said Honda would find it easier to improve their power unit if restrictions were eased to allow more in-season development and he urged governing body the FIA to encourage new entrants.
"There should be a better mechanism for new manufacturers to come into F1 and not be given a hard time like Honda when they are trying to get up to speed," he said.
"We should be embracing them and cutting them and McLaren some slack to be able to develop the engine so they can start to compete. We need them."
Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso have threatened to quit the sport at the end of the season unless they can secure a competitive engine partner and Mansell said he was worried that F1 could be left with a sparse grid.
"We have only got 20 cars on the grid. I am concerned because we want to attract more teams and more manufacturers to F1. Until there are at least 26 cars on the grid everyone should pay attention. It is a must that the teams and manufacturers are there year after year," he said.
Red Bull are on the verge of splitting with current engine partner Renault, despite winning four consecutive world championships from 2010-2013. Ferrari have offered to supply them with year-old engines in 2016, but the Milton Keynes-based outfit want the latest specification.
Mansell said: "Red Bull are a winning team, they want to win and have the power of everybody else. Hopefully it will all be sorted out behind closed doors.
"It's an unfortunate set of circumstances where all the engine rules changed in the last couple of years and one or two manufacturers are head and shoulders above everybody else."
Mansell, who won 31 grands prix in an F1 career that lasted from 1980 to 1995, is not happy that current drivers have to race cautiously to preserve fuel and tyres, while receiving regular instructions from their team over radio.
He said: "The polite word is awful. I like the drivers to race and drive the cars themselves and not be told how to drive it. There are something like 350 settings on the steering wheel now backed up by 30 to 50 engineers telling the driver 'change this, do that, do the other'.
"I'd like the driving to be more in the hands of the driver and less in the hands of the engineers. Sometimes I'm disillusioned that the driver doesn't have the ability to show how great he is. We used to drive around problems - we couldn't alter the car as such when we were driving.
"Sometimes I want to see how great and courageous they are. Most of them are great, courageous drivers but we never get to see that. Take a lot of the aids away. Let the driver manage the car himself."
Mansell said current supplier Pirelli had done a "sterling job" making tyres that deliberately degrade during races, but would be happy if F1 switched to Michelin from 2017, as several leading teams wish.
"To go back to a tyre manufacturer that, historically, has a better, consistent tyre that can possibly last longer will be good for racing," he added.

With reigning champion Lewis Hamilton holding a 48-point lead over Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in this year's standings with five races remaining, Mansell says it is a "done deal" that the Briton will retain his title.
He makes Hamilton a "hot favourite" in 2016 as well but is encouraged by the progress of Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel and is hopeful that Mercedes will face tougher competition next year.
"Lewis is in a league of his own but that's because he's able to refine his talent incredibly with the support of Mercedes and knowing he has got the quickest car," said Mansell, who has just released his autobiography Staying on Track.
"Sebastian Vettel is doing an absolutely wonderful job with Ferrari. They are pushing hard but are not quite on the same level as Mercedes. In isolation in 2015, Lewis is out there on his own. At times Seb is right there with him.
"Lewis is having a wonderful time, exploring life and having fun. For me, having fun makes you a better person. It makes you want to go to work and put it out there even more. When Lewis is on it, he is on it."
Mansell said that Rosberg, who has been out-paced and out-raced by Hamilton in 2016, "needs to pay attention to what he's doing more than what Lewis is doing".
He added: "He's won some great races and he can give Lewis a much bigger challenge if he just focuses himself."

article Third seed Halep, who lost to Maria Sharapova in the 2014 final, began this year's tournament as the favourite.
Victory on Saturday would see the 25-year-old Romanian replace Angelique Kerber as world number one.
Latvian Ostapenko, who turned 20 on Thursday, is ranked 47th and has yet to win a title of any kind.
She has ensured a top-20 place with her run to the final and made history as the first Grand Slam finalist from Latvia.
This year's tournament saw a quarter-final line-up without any former Grand Slam champions for the first time since 1977.
"Of course, this match is really important, and I will not hide the heaviness that it has," said Halep.
"Of course it's going to be a great thing if I can win. But I would like not to think too much, because it puts more pressure on me."
Halep has been widely viewed as the player with the experience and form to clinch a title seen as there for the taking in the absence of Serena Williams.
The American is awaiting the birth of her first child, while former major winners Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova also missing.
When defending champion Garbine Muguruza, top seed Kerber and clay-court contenders Svetlana Kuznetsova and Sam Stosur lost before the quarter-finals, it left the draw wide open.
Halep was on the brink of defeat against Elina Svitolina when she trailed by a set and 5-1, and then held off a fightback from second seed Karolina Pliskova in the semis.
A professional for 11 years, with 15 WTA titles to her name and on the brink of the number one ranking, Halep now has her best chance to land one of the sports four biggest titles.
"I say always that I play well with the pressure, but now I don't need it," said Halep.
"I just take it like a big day, a big match. And definitely I'm ready for it, because I won many matches until now."
Ostapenko has burst out of the pack of potential future stars to become a possible Grand Slam champion in the space of two weeks of brilliant hitting.
Three years after winning junior Wimbledon and joining the senior tour, the Latvian is on the verge of a remarkable triumph.
"Of course I didn't expect that when I came here," said Ostapenko. "But every match I was playing better and better."
Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide.
Her all-out attacking game has thrilled the Paris crowd and seen off the likes of Sam Stosur, Caroline Wozniacki and, over three sets in the semi-final, Timea Bacsinszky.
She has hit more winners at 245 then any other player in the tournament, man or woman, albeit with a sizeable 217 unforced errors.
"It's like I cannot play the whole match, like, amazing," she said. "Sometimes it's up and down, but I still try to fight and play my game.
"And if I do that, I will get back my game and then it can help me to win."
Her surprise run has also brought a phone call from Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis.
"He actually called my mom. So that's what she told me," she said. "Because nobody knows my phone."

article In 2015/16, more than 250,000 syringes were given out to drug users in the area - 27% of the total across north Wales.
A report was commissioned last November after concerns from residents that discarded needles blighted the area.
Wrexham councillors discussed its findings on Thursday.
A group looking into the issue was chaired by Councillor Carole O'Toole, who said needles could cause injury, stop children using public spaces and affect the perception of crime and community safety.
There were also concerns it was also undermining attempts to attract visitors to the town and creating "no-go areas" for residents.
Wrexham Streetscene - which cleans public-owned land - said the problem has "grown considerably in recent months", with a number of areas highlighted as "hotspots".
In the report, a resident described the scene of "filth" at Rhos Cemetery, saying this could cause "major harm" to children playing there.
"Innocent people need to be protected", they said.
"I could have picked up 200 needles in two minutes and then there are used condoms and human faeces that go with it."
Another resident said they find up to 40 discarded needles every day on Holt Road.
"I have heard some say that Wrexham hasn't got a problem but I think they are walking around with their eyes closed," they added.
Council-owned land adjacent to Capel-y-Groes in the town centre was also highlighted as becoming an "encampment" for homeless and substance, drug and alcohol mis-users in August.
With some suffering from mental health issues and "complex problems" surrounding them, the report said simply moving the people on is not easy.
"(Things) can spiral out of control rapidly and create a hugely challenging situation which is quickly overwhelming to all those trying to deal with it," the report said.
It added: "In the worst affected areas, people in our communities, especially the most vulnerable like the elderly, young families, feel intimidated and harassed by the people causing the problems.
"And it is not just at night - it's in the middle of the day."
Of the 945,664 needles and syringes issued by community pharmacies and other outlets in 2015/16 to people in the six north Wales authorities, 26.9% (254,453) were distributed in Wrexham.
The report lists recommendations for addressing the issue, that include reporting, dealing with and cleaning up drug litter and working with Betsi Cadwaldr University Health Board to recognise and tackle the specific issue in Wrexham.
A legal order giving police and council officials powers to disperse anyone causing a nuisance such as taking drugs in Wrexham town centre came into force in August.

article The study, by Imperial College London, calculated such eating habits could prevent 7.8 million premature deaths each year.
The team also identified specific fruit and veg that reduced the risk of cancer and heart disease.
The analysis showed even small amounts had a health boon, but more is even better.
A portion counts as 80g (3oz) of fruit or veg - the equivalent of a small banana, a pear or three heaped teaspoons of spinach or peas.
The conclusions were made by pooling data on 95 separate studies, involving two million people's eating habits.
Lower risks of cancer were linked to eating:
Lower risks of heart disease and strokes were linked to eating:
The results, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, also assessed the risk of dying before your time.
Compared with eating no fruit or veg a day, it showed:
The researchers do not know if eating even more fruit and veg would have even greater health benefits as there is little evidence out there to review.
Dr Dagfinn Aune, one of the researchers, said: "Fruit and vegetables have been shown to reduce cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and to boost the health of our blood vessels and immune system.
"This may be due to the complex network of nutrients they hold.
"For instance, they contain many antioxidants, which may reduce DNA damage and lead to a reduction in cancer risk."
However, many people struggle to even eat the five a day (400g) recommended by the World Health Organization.
In the UK, only about one in three people eats enough.
Dr Aune said the findings did not mean the five-a-day message needed to change.
He told the BBC: "There are many different considerations if changing policy, it's not just the health effects - is it feasible?
"But our findings are quite clear in that they do support five a day, but there are even some further benefits for higher intakes."
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: "The five-a-day target is the foundation of a healthy balanced diet and is an achievable way to help prevent a number of diseases.
"Whilst consuming more than five portions of fruit and vegetables a day may be desirable... adding pressure to consume more fruit and vegetables creates an unrealistic expectation."
Not all of the 95 studies that were analysed fully accounted for other aspects of lifestyle, such as exercise levels, that could also play a role in prolonging lives.
However, Dr Aune said the conclusions were "quite robust".

article The new analysis by the Sutton Trust identified "major weaknesses" in performance in sciences in particular.
Opposition leaders described the report as "shameful" and blamed "catastrophic failures" by the SNP.
But Ms Sturgeon insisted her reforms were "narrowing" the gap between pupils from different backgrounds.
She said the report illustrated the importance of initiatives like the attainment fund, which gives money directly to head teachers.
Researchers from the Sutton Trust think tank found a gap equivalent to more than two years in schooling for science, reading and maths between pupils from less well-off backgrounds in the top 10% of achievers nationally, compared to their equally clever but better-off peers.
The analysis used figures from the latest international Pisa tests - which Ms Sturgeon observed were actually carried out almost two years ago.
The report said Scotland had "few stand-out strengths" when it comes to the performance of the most able pupils, but added that "the gap between able advantaged and disadvantaged children does not stand out as particularly large or small relative to other countries".
It said: "There is no specific area where able children in Scotland really excel. The major weaknesses include a pronounced and sustained decline in able pupils' performance in science, equivalent to around a year of schooling, over the last decade.
"It is also below the median OECD country in reading and mathematics, while trailing behind the performance of able pupils in England in most subject areas."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the report had revealed "particularly shameful" findings on attainment and science.
She said: "We now see the consequences of 10 wasted years of this SNP government and the harm it has done to the life chances of our pupils."
Ms Davidson described the government's legacy as a "generation of Scottish children who are being left behind in the race for qualifications and for future jobs".
In response, the Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the report as an "important" one, but said the data it was using pre-dates her latest reforms.
To be absolutely clear, this is not new data. The Sutton Trust has taken the international Pisa findings, published in December, and matched pupil performance to household income.
They confirmed that there was a significant gap in attainment between the offspring of poorer and wealthier households. Again to be clear, the gap was greater in England.
However, unlike in England, they discerned that the brightest Scottish school pupils were scoring below the average in developed countries. There had been a notable decline in science.
Now it is possible to challenge the Pisa findings, to question their methodology, their sampling, their interpretation. It is equally possible to challenge today's analysis by the Sutton Trust, an organisation which campaigns on behalf of disadvantaged children.
Would the Scottish government follow that route? John Swinney's solemn demeanour during the opening question from Ruth Davidson made clear: they would not.

Ms Sturgeon said said: "It is an important report. It is one that aids our understanding of the challenges we need to address in order to tackle the attainment gap.
"I think it is important to note, though, that the Sutton Trust does not present new data. It is analysis of the Pisa scores that were published in December. Of course, the Pisa scores are based on a survey that was carried out two years ago.
"A survey that pre-dates the attainment challenge and pre-dates the reforms to our education system that are under way."
Ms Sturgeon said there are signs of a "narrowing of the attainment gap".
She added: "I want to see it narrow further and I want to see it narrow faster, which is why we are taking the action that we are doing."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also challenged the first minister on the report, saying it exposed "catastrophic failures" by the government.
She said: "Time and time again I have come here and argued that the SNP are leaving the poorest children behind. Now this report shows they are also holding the brightest children back."
Ms Dugdale recalled the first minister had said education would be the "defining priority" of her administration, but claimed that in power she is "failing a whole generation of children".
Ms Sturgeon pointed to additional cash going to schools as part of the attainment fund, which will see Â£120m given directly to head teachers.
The first minister said: "That is the kind of investment we need to see in our schools, the kind of investment that this government is delivering in our schools."
While she said politicians were right to ask questions about education, Ms Sturgeon also insisted they have "an obligation to get behind the reforms we are introducing".
She added: "Some of these reforms we see members on the Labour benches having initially backed them, but when they come under some pressure on them decide they don't back them at all.
"This Sutton Trust report underlines the importance and necessity of those reforms to education."

article It was on the beaches of the Barry Buddon military training centre in Angus that Lt Col Edwin Hautenville Richardson first proved that man's best friend could follow him to the front lines.
Richardson was living in Carnoustie in the run-up to World War One when he demonstrated how dogs - in particular Airedale Terriers - could be trained to carry out a range of military tasks, from carrying messages to locating injured men.
Other countries, including France and Germany, were already using dogs in a variety of roles, but it was Richardson's work in Scotland that convinced the British High Command that the animals had a role to play at the front.
As early as 1895 Richardson noticed a German man buying a sheepdog from a shepherd, and learned that the German army was buying large quantities of British collies for military service.
After marrying fellow dog lover Blanche Bannon, the couple bought land for farming on the east coast of Scotland, where they pursued their mutual interest in canine training.
Officers at the nearby Barry Buddon army camp took an interest in their work, and let Richardson bring his dogs in to experiment during the training of soldiers as war clouds gathered over Europe.
Richardson - and Blanche - were eventually asked to set up the British War Dogs training school at Shoeburyness, Essex, where they trained hundreds of hounds for service in both world wars.
Wendy Turner, secretary of the Airedale Terrier Club of Scotland, can see why Richardson considered the determined terriers to have the right character for military service.
"At first he specialised in collies and terriers, but then in the Airedale he found what he considered to be the ideal dog," she said.
"They're very determined. They're very single-minded and there's no stopping them.
"Richardson was obviously an experienced trainer - they're notoriously difficult to train, you have to start from a  young age.
"He used Barry Buddon for helping examine the dogs for them, it was done unofficially for the officers here, before he would take them down south and show them the finished product."
Once their usefulness became clear, the animals were widely used by the Red Cross on the battlefield, as well as carrying messages for the military and acting as guard dogs.
"The Red Cross used them as first aid carriers, they had a little package on their neck with medication in it and everything, and they were used for going out and finding wounded soldiers on the battlefield," said Mrs Turner.
"Edwin Richardson would actually pay unemployed locals to come and be the injured and dead people lying about the dunes so the dogs could find them."
Recruits for Richardson's Shoeburyness school were recruited from Battersea Dogs Home, and strays were sent in from police stations around the country.
After an appeal was put out for volunteers, one woman wrote in saying "I've given my husband and my sons, and now that he too is required, I give my dog."
The dogs were trained to wear gas masks and navigate the treacherous and often terrifying conditions of the front lines.
There are countless tales of heroic service on the part of war dogs; one Airedale, named Jack, came to the rescue of his battalion when they found themselves totally cut off, surrounded by shell-holes and barbed wire - and needed to summon reinforcements.
"No man could get through the environment, and their one chance was Jack," said Alastair Petrie, a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army who has owned a number of Airedales.
"A piece of shrapnel smashed his jaw, but he carried on, and another shell tore open his coat right down his back, and he kept on going.
"Finally his forepaw was shattered, but he dragged his body for the last three kilometres.
"There was the glaze of death in his eyes when he reached headquarters, but he'd done his work - he'd saved his battalion."
Richardson's work continued right into World War Two, although the school was moved to Bulford, in Wiltshire, and he even penned a book about British war dogs and their training.
The Airedale Terrier Club of Scotland is now planning a celebration of the work of Richardson and the sacrifices made by all dogs during the war.
They have created special hand-made bandanas bearing the slogan "we also served" and are urging club members and other dog owners to bring their pets to remembrance services.
"It's wonderful, when you read about them - although obviously I am biased towards Airedales," Mrs Turner said.
"They really were magnificent."

article The approach was made on Tuesday but was quickly turned down by Preston.
Cunningham was seen as a possible replacement for Joe Bennett, who has been in talks with Fulham after they triggered his release clause.
But Bennett may now stay with the Bluebirds and is weighing up the offer, with the player considering staying at the Cardiff City Stadium.
Republic of Ireland international Cunningham has made more than 50 appearances for Preston.
Bluebirds manager Neil Warnock confirmed after his side's 2-0 win over Sheffield United that Fulham had made an approach for Bennett.
"There is a clause in his contract ... and if they trigger that clause there's not a lot I can do," he said.
Warnock would not confirm if Cardiff had made specific offers for players, but added: "There's a few the media have not mentioned that I've been talking to. You'll just have to wait and see."
summary Preston have rejected a bid from Fulham for striker James Cunningham.

article Mr Clegg said the party had taken a "hard look in the mirror" since sexual harassment claims against the former Lib Dem chief executive first emerged.
Lord Rennard was suspended for bringing the party into disrepute after failing to apologise over the allegations.
But disciplinary action was dropped and the matter declared closed on Tuesday.
Business Secretary Vince Cable said the issue had been "very painful" for the party.
In a statement, Lord Rennard said he was "pleased" and pointed out that none of the allegations against him had been proven.
"I remain a committed member of the Liberal Democrats and a strong believer in the principles of the party, as set out in the constitution, and based on the values that led me to join the Liberal Party in my teens," he said.
He had initially refused to apologise over the allegations by four female activists last year. However, he later expressed regret, conceding that he may have "inadvertently" encroached upon "personal space".
By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent
The long-running disciplinary process inside the Lib Dems wasn't just about the reputation of one man - it was about the reputation of the party itself.
The result of the independent investigation by a QC into allegations of sexual harassment produced the worst possible political outcome - the women's evidence was said to have been broadly credible, but the allegations weren't proven beyond reasonable doubt.
That led to the complainants claiming the party wasn't taking their concerns seriously, while it made Lord Rennard at first wary of apologising for what he later called inadvertent encroachment of personal space - in case that appeared to be an admission of guilt.
So the new disciplinary proceedings that followed his initial failure to say sorry also led to further bad headlines for the Lib Dems.
And despite Lord Rennard's subsequent apology, some of his accusers continued to press for his expulsion from the party.
Party officials knew a line had to be drawn under the row well before the election.
But if they had hoped for a muted reaction by announcing Lord Rennard's reinstatement during the parliamentary recess, their wishes haven't been fulfilled.
As Lord Rennard's suspension was lifted, the deputy prime minister pledged a root-and-branch review of his party's culture and processes.
He also signalled plans to reduce the burden of proof in party disciplinary cases, which currently require guilt to be established - as in criminal trials - beyond reasonable doubt.
"The Liberal Democrats have taken a long, hard look in the mirror since these allegations were made last year and I am confident that the party has changed," Mr Clegg said.
"It is clear that a number of women in our party felt let down that the party failed to act on their complaints appropriately. I am determined that no member of our party should find themselves in that position again."
Mr Cable told the BBC: "We've spent 14 months on this.  It's been very difficult, very painful, particularly for the women who were involved. But the decision's been made that there was no evidence to pursue an expulsion of Lord Rennard."
The lifting of Lord Rennard's suspension quickly drew criticism, including from his complainants.
Susan Gaszczak, one of the women who made claims against him and who quit after the party refused to expel him, said the Lib Dems had "no backbone".
In a statement, she added: "The party democracy obviously has no moral compass. They say we are credible, then fail to act on it and don't see the impact this has on women and women voters."
Another complainant, Alison Goldworthy, said: "Faced with the opportunity to take strong action, the Liberal Democrats have once more failed to act.
"That is quite wrong. It is an outcome of which the party should be ashamed."
In January, a party inquiry by independent barrister Alistair Webster QC concluded that there should be no further action against Lord Rennard, saying that while "broadly credible", the claims could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt.
A Lib Dem spokesman confirmed on Tuesday that the Regional Parties Committee had considered Mr Webster's report and decided not to proceed with disciplinary action against Lord Rennard.
"This brings the matter to a close and means the suspension of his membership is lifted," the spokesman said.
Gloria De Piero, Labour's spokeswoman for women and equalities, said Mr Clegg had sent a clear message to women voters - that he was "more interested in trying to salvage the Lib Dems' fading election hopes than doing the right thing by the women who made these serious complaints".

Butchart ran alongside Farah at the Rio Olympics, finishing sixth behind the 5,000m champion.
Yet he insists that Farah can be beaten at the World Championships in August.
"Nobody is invincible. It's easier for me because I am the underdog," Butchart told BBC Scotland.
"It's going to be hard. Obviously it's Mo's last ever World Championships, so the spotlight is going to be on him.
"But I could potentially get a medal there, who knows?"
Scottish endurance athletes are currently sitting at the top table of British Athletics. Laura Muir, Lynsey Sharp and Eilish McColgan have all won medals at major games, while Chris O'Hare and Butchart represent further success stories.
All five Olympians are currently in Flagstaff, honing their skills at the elite high-altitude training camp facilitated by British Athletics.
Farah is also in attendance, with the four-time Olympic champion bidding to bow out of his illustrious track career at the very top in his home city of London.
The 34-year-old is revered by camp personnel - his preparation must not be interrupted.
Farah won his second Rio gold medal in 13 minutes 3.30 seconds, with Butchart five and a half seconds behind.
The 25-year-old from Dunblane was a relative unknown until two years ago when he packed in his job to go warm weather training with his Central AC training mates.
"Before, I was working four or five times a week and kind of fitting runs in between that," he said.
"A few of the guys decided to go away, and so I tried to get leave but [his employers] wouldn't give me it. So I decided to sack the job for my athletics."
The gamble paid off, and Butchart's self-confidence was quickly rewarded. His world ranking rose and sponsorship followed. In Butchart's methodical mind, it was simple cause and effect.
"Every athlete has to believe in themselves that they can perform," he said. "I always think I am the best or going to be the best, and that's just how it's going to be."
To be the best, Butchart will have to make strides past Farah, only the second man to retain the 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic titles.
Butchart is no longer sprinting around the track at Stirling University after a man on a bike; he is now living in a full-time, elite training environment.
His current house-mate is the former European 800m champion Sharp, and the pair live their lives under the care of coaches and scrutiny of sports scientists.
Meals with the precisely appropriate calorie content are consumed and blood oxygenation levels are regularly recorded to ensure that the rarefied air of high altitude is having the desired effect.
Down-time includes good conversation, coffee shops and carefully selected tiny treats, a mix that suits the determined and gregarious Butchart.
There is no doubt the high altitude life is hard, and the first indications of the rewards will become clear in August, at sea level, in London.

Ms Badcock, who will throw the first bun said: "Bun throwing is a major event for Abingdon.
"It does not take place every year and therefore people very much look forward to taking part when there is a royal event to celebrate."

article CES kicks off next week - a sprawling consumer technology showcase that seems to extend to more Las Vegas venues every year.
From Samsung to one-person start-ups, thousands of companies will demo new products, while, behind-the-scenes, deals will be struck to make further generations of gadgets possible.
"Every CES is fresh and different, and we try to see what the future will bring," the event's organiser Gary Shapiro says.
"What I've learned is that sometimes the companies themselves don't even know if they're going to get their product finished in time."
CES 2016: Vegas tech show preview
VHS recorders, HD TVs, the Xbox games console and Blu-ray discs all made their debut at past shows.
But one expert suggests the tech giants may temper their ambitions this time round.
"Say goodbye to cool, say hello to practical," explains John Curran from the consultancy Accenture.
"Many of the larger companies now put less emphasis on CES as a launch pad for major hardware. So, they will focus instead on showing off new services to help garner excitement for existing products.
"But for the smaller businesses this is as big a venue as they are going to be able to find and is an excellent opportunity to catch the eye of journalists and key buyers from the retailers."
New TV tech always makes a stir at CES, even if some of the innovations are not always practical.
In recent years, Samsung and LG have slugged it out to boast the biggest sets, but this year it may be about having the bendiest.
LG made headlines in May when it showed off an ultra-thin prototype that could be peeled off the wall - it will be fascinating to see how much further the two South Korean firms have developed the concept.
As far as screens you might actually want to buy soon, expect the focus on be on "HDR".
The acronym refers to high dynamic range, and basically means that TVs can show millions more shades of colour and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown.
Amazon actually started streaming some of its shows in HDR this year, but competing standards meant the TV-makers hadn't put their marketing muscle behind the format.
That's likely to change at CES when a coalition of the leading players reveal a new specification. It will let them badge TVs to show they will support future HDR-coded content.
That should prevent an embarrassing repeat of the fact that many of the early 4K sets ended up being incompatible with the way ultra high definition video is now streamed.
Netflix had previously said it was waiting until this moment to start supporting HDR - expect its chief executive Reed Hastings to reveal more at his keynote CES speech.
And while it's likely to be many years before the mainstream broadcasters adopt HDR, several of the movie studios have said they will offer it on 4K Blu-ray discs - the first players are also expected to be unveiled at CES.
A big will-they won't-they question mark hangs over GoPro's CES plans.
The action camera-maker has promised to launch a drone called Karma in 2016.
Rumours suggest it could deliver 360-degree views and incorporate collision-avoidance tech
The firm's chief executive Nicholas Woodman is speaking at a dinner event, but it's still unclear if he'll offer a first peek at the aircraft.
Even if GoPro holds fire, there are dozens of other firms set to show off flying tech, including:
Britain's Intelligent Energy will also be showing off a hydrogen fuel cell, which it says lets drones stay airborne for hours, rather than minutes, at a time.
Chip-makers Intel and Qualcomm will try to explain why adopting their rival drone technologies could give manufacturers an edge.
And the Federal Aviation Administration has a booth and will likely provide an update on its new register for US-based drone owners.
Following years of hype, 2016 looks to be the year that virtual reality becomes - well, reality.
HTC is inviting select journalists to take a look at its revamped Vive VR headset on Monday.
The headset - created in conjunction with video games firm Valve - was supposed to have gone on sale by now.
However, the Taiwanese firm delayed the launch to add what it says is a "very big technological breakthrough".
Is it eye-tracking sensors, a way to get rid of its external wiring or something else? We'll soon know.
Sony is set to follow with its own press conference on Tuesday when we should get more details of the PlayStation VR - the add-on headset for its bestselling console.
But one company watcher thinks the Japanese firm will miss a trick if it doesn't make another VR-centric announcement.
"Sony should come out with an accessory to convert its Z5 Premium smartphone into a VR solution," says Ben Wood from consultants CCS Insight.
"Its 4K screen is a solution looking for a problem - its high resolution really would lend itself to the experience."
Oculus has already carried out a similar trick for Samsung's phones, but its focus this time will be on the Rift.
The Facebook-owned business recently confirmed the PC-powered VR headset is "on-target" for a Q1 launch.
With pre-orders about to begin, surely it's time to find out how much it will cost.
There should also be news about "affordable" 360-degree cameras - if VR is going to take off beyond gaming, people need an easy way to record their own videos.
In addition, keep an ear out for new audio-recording equipment capable of matching sounds to a VR user's point-of-view - France's Arkamys has already teased one solution that will be on show.
The Consumer Technology Association is talking up this category, noting there's 71% more space dedicated to robots than in 2015.
Few think robots are ready to go mainstream just yet, but there's still several companies worth keeping an eye on.
The US start-up Jibo is creating a lot of buzz after its "social robot" raised over $3.7m (Â£2.5m) on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. The project's chief, Cynthia Breazeal, will be popping into town to provide an update.
There are a couple of new droids from France - the Buddy companion bot (which you can see at the top of this article) and Leka, a machine designed to stimulate children with autism and other developmental disorders.
And from Japan, Flower Robotics promises to bring "beauty" to the field by showing off robots designed to be as aesthetically pleasing as they are useful.
You might appreciate its efforts in the future, when squadrons of the automatons are zipping about.
As we career towards roads full of self-driving, electric-powered vehicles, the automakers are embracing CES as a chance to reveal their latest innovations.
Ten of the big-name car manufacturers are exhibiting this year, but much of the pre-show buzz is being generated by a Chinese firm looking to disrupt the sector.
Faraday Future has promised to unveil a "concept" that will help "define the future of mobility".
The company has already lured several executives away from Tesla, announced plans to build a state-of-the-art factory near Las Vegas, and received backing from China's tech billionaire Jia Yueting. We'll learn more at its event on Monday.
Volkswagen will hope to steer back attention the next day - and repair its battered reputation - when its chief executive takes to the stage.
The firm has said it will have a new concept vehicle to show off - rumours suggest it will be an electric Microbus capable of driving up to 500km (310 miles) on a single charge.
Ford's boss, Mark Fields, is also in attendance. It's been reported that he's working on a tie-up with Google to create a new self-driving car business.
But it's not clear whether this will feature in his CES presentation or be kept back for the Detroit Auto Show later in the month.
BMW, however, has already confirmed it will be demonstrating Air Touch - a control mechanism for its in-car maps and entertainment systems that 3D-scans hand gestures to let drivers avoid having to fumble for buttons.
And Toyota is promising to show off a new "high-precision" road imaging system that will let self-driving cars share what they've seen to keep their maps up to date.
The technology may do away with the need to send out special vehicles equipped with expensive laser scanners to get the data.
"There'll also be more than 100 smaller auto tech companies," adds Accenture's John Curran.
"This year's focus will be a little bit less on infotainment and more on security and safety - so,  we should see new collision avoidance technologies, anti-car jacking tech and ways for cars to communicate with each other."
Despite smartwatches gaining ground in 2015, Fitbit and its fitness trackers remain wearable tech's bestselling brand.
The firm has an early-morning press conference on Tuesday, suggesting it has something major to reveal.
"We could see a revision of Fitbit devices and software to better track stress via heart rate variability and skin temperature, along with software that offers coaching for better sleep and stress management," predicts Charles Anderson from the investment bank Dougherty & Company.
"We also expect to see Fitbit in more pacts with fashion brands."
The firm's activity-logging rival Misfit is also at CES. The business was recently taken over by the watch giant Fossil, and we may see the first fruits of their tie-up.
Chinese tech giant Huawei is tipped to unveil a smartwatch targeted at women and smaller start-ups are also expected to unveil female-friendly wrist-wear.
"There's been a very male bias to wearable tech but you're going to see what I call the jewellification of this stuff," predicts CCS Insight's Ben Wood.
"There's a big gap in the market - wearables for women will be a big theme."
Of course, another theme will be wearables that don't call attention to themselves, at least not until needed.
For instance, the French firm Atol will be showing normal looking glasses that tell a smartphone app where they are when lost.
In&motion has what it says is the world's first "smart airbag" for skiers - a vest that inflates in less than a tenth of a second upon impact.
And Digitsole has new shoes that tie up their own laces - something we've been waiting for ever since Back to the Future II.
Wearable tech for pets is also set to become more subtle.
PitPat, for instance, has a fairly unobtrusive activity tracker for dogs - a far cry from some of the more clunky animal-centric efforts seen at past CES shows.
Cosmetics companies are starting to embrace consumer electronics.
L'Oreal is back for a second year with a new mystery product following the success of its Makeup Genius app in 2015.
Another French firm, Romy, is in town with a device that custom-mixes skincare ingredients to suit each user at different times of the day.
And the UK's Amirose is pitching in to offer special cucumber-enhanced eye pads said to be specially formulated to soothe "computer eyes".
There should also be a plethora of products that promise to aid longer-term benefits.
For instance, Ceracor will debut a sensor that measures the level of haemoglobin in the blood, which it says athletes can use to boost their endurance.
And Skulpt is showing off Chisel, a device that it says can be used to measure body fat and muscle quality.
As ever with health tech, some of the claims will need to be put under scrutiny.
Canada's Medical Wearable Solutions, for example, will have to justify its boast that its EyeForcer glasses are the solution to "the epidemic of Gameboy disease".
Also look out for an explosion in the number of products targeted at new parents, including a sensor that measures contractions, telling mothers when to go to hospital, and a smart changing pad that tracks the growth of newborns.
Four million UK households already contain some sort of smart home system, according to a recent report by Strategy Analytics.
Nest and Philips paved the way, expect a fresh flood of internet-connected thermostats, lights, fire alarms and plug sockets at the show - as well as new ways to control them.
Samsung has said it intends to make its next range of Smart TVs double as command-and-control "smart hubs", while LG has pre-announced the SmartThinQ Hub - a cylindrical device that does much the same thing.
If at this point you are trying to stifle a yawn, hold on - there are a few products in this category that intrigue.
The man who developed the original iMovie for Apple has turned his attention to laundry and will unveil a washing/drying machine called Marathon at Monday's CES Unveiled preview.
The device can be set to keep clothes locked inside until their rightful owner returns - although how many flatshares will be able to afford its $1,200 (Â£810) price is another matter.
Invoxia will be showing off Triby - a connected-kitchen product powered by Amazon's voice-activated assistant Alexa.
And there will also be other new kit to enhance the home including a showerhead that tracks how much water it has used, a module that lets you control gas fireplaces from your phone and a sofa that vibrates in time with shows on TV.
It's been said that it's a heck of a lot easier to get an overview of CES from outside Vegas rather than trying to tramp around its epic-sized show floors.
We'll certainly try to highlight the key announcements as well as some of the more weird and quirky reveals.
You can follow the news via our special CES index and we'll also post highlights to our Facebook page.

article Mr Beshira, 21, was pronounced dead on Kilburn High Road in north-west London at 17:20 GMT on Thursday after being shot in the abdomen.
A 22-year-old man was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of murder and remains in custody.
Metropolitan Police said they believe Mr Beshira was shot on Palmerston Road and staggered 200 yards.
Officers are searching for a man described as slim and white who was wearing jeans and a dark top with his hood up and the lower half of his face covered.
Members of the public were already attending to Mr Beshira, who had collapsed outside a cafe, when the emergency services arrived.
Witnesses described the area as "mayhem" after the shooting with reports of fights breaking out in a crowd.
Det Ch Insp Andy Partridge said the gunman was "loitering in and around Palmerston Road and the Webheath Estate prior to the attack".
He said: "We know the area was extremely busy at the time of the shooting.
"I am convinced that other members of the public have either seen the incident itself, or have seen the suspect arrive at the scene or flee after the shooting."

article The other last-four tie sees Juventus - in their first semi-final since 2003 - face Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid, the defending champions.
The first legs will be played on 5 and 6 May, with the return matches a week later.
In the Europa League, holders Sevilla face Fiorentina, while Rafael Benitez's Napoli are up against Ukraine's Dnipro.
Bayern boss Guardiola won 14 trophies as a manager - including the Champions League in 2009 and 2011 - during four years at Barcelona.
He has reached the Champions League semi-finals in each of his six seasons as a manager, four with Barca and now two with Bayern.
The Catalan said: "Everyone understands how special this game is for me, for [midfielder] Thiago and my staff.
"Barcelona was our life. Barcelona is my home.
"Barcelona are the best team at the moment. I am not surprised. He (Luis Enrique) has a lot of quality. He is a great guy and I am happy I will be facing him."
Ancelotti will also be reunited with one of his former clubs, with the Italian having managed the Turin side from 1999 to 2001.
The draw leaves open the possibility of a Barcelona v Real Madrid European Cup final, something which has never happened before. The arch-rivals are also battling it out for the Spanish league title this season.
Real Madrid reached the last four by beating city rivals Atletico - in a repeat of last season's final - thanks to Javier Hernandez's late goal.
Bayern Munich thrashed Porto 6-1 at home to overturn a first-leg deficit and progress 7-4 on aggregate.
Things were more straightforward for Barcelona, who beat Paris St-Germain 5-1 overall, and Juventus, who beat Monaco 1-0 over two legs.
This season's final will be played at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday, 6 June.
The Europa League draw leaves the possibility of an all-Serie A final. There have been four all-Italian Uefa Cup finals, but none since the tournament was rebranded in 2009.
The first legs of the semi-finals will be played on Thursday, 7 May with the return matches a week later.
The final is in Warsaw's National Stadium on Wednesday, 27 May.

article Archaeologists have unearthed walls about 1m (3ft) thick at Tintagel Castle in Cornwall in the first excavation of a five-year English Heritage project.
It is thought the walls formed part of the seat of the rulers of the early medieval kingdom of Dumnonia.
Winn Scutt from English Heritage said it was a "very dense settlement".
"It's a complex of buildings and many people since the 1980s have argued that it's a royal centre, and that it's the royal centre of the kingdom of Dumnonia", the properties curator said.
"We haven't found any others, so it's quite possible that this was the centre, and maybe they were static."
Some of the buildings had been excavated in the 1930s by the British archaeologist Ralegh Radford who had thought they formed part of a monastery, Mr Scutt said.
He added the excavations did not tell us "anything" about King Arthur, the legendary ruler who was conceived at Tintagel Castle according to the 12th Century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth.
Discoveries at the site also include large amounts of pottery from the eastern Mediterranean used for olive oil and wine, as well as Merovingian glass and fine Phocaean tableware from the west coast of Turkey.
Mr Scutt said the richness of the discoveries made Tintagel "one of the most important sites in western Europe".
"It isn't just a trading centre to move olive oil around, they're actually indulging in it, they're feasting here", he said.
English Heritage has appointed Cornwall Archaeological Unit (CAU) to carry out the excavations which form the first major research project of the area since the 1990s.

article Analysis by BBC News shows the equivalent of £168 was spent on each child in order to hire in extra staff to cover vacancies and absences.
Teachers unions say the amount of money spent reflects a "serious teacher recruitment and retention crisis".
The government said the number of quality teachers was at a record high.
The latest data for schools in England shows spending on supply teachers accounted for 6% of the total amount spent on teaching staff wages.  The overall figure spent on supply teachers fell by £18m on the previous year.
Schools in London collectively spent the most on supply teachers. Primary and secondary schools in the capital spent £212m on extra staff, the equivalent of £260 per child.
The Robert Clack School, in Dagenham, east London, spent the most on supply teachers in England. According to the government's data the school spent £953,807 on extra staff - the equivalent of £526 per child.
Dr Neil Geach, the school's chair of governors, said the figures included expenditure on counselling staff, extra-curricular sport staff and professional development spending.
"The figures as reported do not reflect reality... We do not use unqualified staff or cover supervisors to cover teaching groups - our children's education is too important."
Aside from London, Yorkshire and Humberside had the highest spending rate for supply staff of £161 per pupil, followed by schools in the West Midlands, which spent £160.
Schools in the East of England spent the lowest amount per pupil - £137 for every child.
Graham School in Scarborough, North Yorkshire spent £556,776 on supply teachers during the course of 2014-15, which was the highest amount in Yorkshire and Humberside.
Two years ago, the school was in special measures owing to its poor performance and as a result the new head teacher Helen McEvoy said she had to replace 45% of the teachers who were working in the school.
"Yes we have spent on a lot on extra teachers but that reflects the successful journey we've been on coming out of special measures," she said.
"Our use of supply teachers reflects how in the past we've had a lot of vacant posts and that's because it can be hard to attract teachers to come and work in a remote part of the country."
Government figures for 2014 show that teacher vacancy rate across England stood at 0.3%, which meant about 1,000 posts were vacant.
Teachers unions have expressed concerns about the use of private supply teacher agencies, claiming that some firms are putting the pursuit of profit ahead of providing high quality teachers.
The BBC found schools spent twice as much on buying in extra staff through private agencies than sourcing additional staff through local councils.
'Valuable role'
Becca Morgan, who set up the supply agency Principal Teachers in Catterick 16 years ago, said her company was currently experiencing its busiest ever period.
"We start dealing with schools looking for supply teachers at 6.30 in the morning and I often stop answering calls at midnight. To put it bluntly without companies like mine the reality is that the education system would grind to a halt."
Chris Keates, the general secretary of the union NASUWT, said the spend on supply staff reflected a "serious teacher recruitment and retention crisis".
A spokesman for the Department for Education said: "Supply teachers provide a valuable role for schools, and schools themselves are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to head teachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences.
"The number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with over 1,000 more graduates training to teach secondary subjects now than a year ago. The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained around or below 1% for the past 15 years."

article Not only is the first royal tour for the newlyweds a photo opportunity to die for - just think of all the different hats and dresses Kate will wear - for Canada, it's a matter of cultural identity.
While Canadians remain deeply divided on the issue of the monarchy, support for Crown rule appears to be gaining ground, thanks to what will be three royal tours in as many calendar years and a staunchly traditionalist Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper.
When Charles and Camilla popped over for a visit in November 2009, loyalist crowds were embarrassingly thin on the ground. An Angus Reid poll conducted at the time found that two-thirds of Canadians wanted to see an elected home-grown head of state.
But just seven months later when the Queen came to stay, royal support had perked up. A record-breaking crowd of over 100,000 turned up to greet Her Maj on Parliament Hill - more than double the regular turnout.
Surveyed at the time, Canadians reported overwhelmingly positive feelings for the Queen and the number who felt the monarchy was outdated then dropped to just under half - not exactly a 21-gun salute, although we gave her one of those as well.
Presumably the Palace learned its lesson: If Britain wants to strengthen Commonwealth bonds, send over your most charismatic royals. And it helps if they are extremely good-looking.
Now that Canada is the first to officially welcome Will and Kate, the nation is poised to return the love.
And what better choice of host could there be? Like the royal couple themselves, Canada is young, clean-cut, polite, uncontroversial and financially secure. A bit dull, perhaps, but we make up for it with upbeat small talk and unfailing good manners. It's an approach to life the Royal Family instinctively understands.
Last spring, Canadians got up in droves in the wee hours to watch the royal wedding - a reception that could only have validated Prime Minister Stephen Harper's own not-so-covert monarchist agenda.
In the past couple of years, his Tory government has re-introduced the crown to Canada Customs agents' badges, emphasised the swearing of allegiance to the Queen in the Oath of Citizenship and reportedly has plans to to tie together the bicentennial of the War of 1812 (in which Canada, as a colony, fought with British troops against the US) with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year.
When asked during last spring's election campaign whether he supported UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's wish to abolish male primogeniture in the Royal Family (a move that would have serious constitutional ramifications for Canada), Mr Harper was dismissive.
"The successor to the throne is a man. The next successor to the throne is a man. I don't think Canadians want to open a debate on the monarchy or constitutional matters at this time. That's our position, and I just don't see that as a priority for Canadians right now at all."
Judging by the warm-to-slathering reception William and Kate have received from the Canadian media so far, the PM's instincts are right.
While Canadians might have strong opinions about the monarchy when polled, the Monarchist League of Canada estimates that in fact fewer than 0.6% of the population is actively engaged in the debate over the issue of republicanism.
The prevailing mood in parliament is, if it ain't broke, why fix it?
John Fraser, author of the forthcoming book The Secret Crown: Canada's Fling With Royalty, recently observed: "The idea of a Canadian monarchy, derived from our history and evolved through our federal and provincial offices of governor general and lieutenant governors, rests on a firm foundation of two sturdy and irrefutable facts: It exists and it works."
Maclean's, a popular Canadian news magazine (for which Fraser and I occasionally write), has produced four special commemorative issues and a royal wedding book since the the royal couple announced their engagement late last year - that's over 500 glossy magazine pages devoted to a pair who live an ocean away.
Cathrin Bradbury, editor-in-chief of Maclean's Intelligence Unit, says Canadians can't get enough of the young royals.
"It's a love story - a happy, well-matched, stylish pairing of two great-looking young people with the future gleaming in their eyes," she said in an interview, adding that the fascination is not just about celebrity.
"Canadians, many Canadians, are proud and serious monarchists. It's part of who we are, and how we govern ourselves.
"And it's a very visible way that we are not American, and not being American is central to our identity. There are some who say the monarchy will survive longer in Canada than in Britain, and they might be right. William, King of Canada."
Or perhaps King Harry instead, if you agree with Etienne Boisvert, the Quebec provincial spokesman for the Monarchist League of Canada, who this week told the press he thought William's younger brother ought to take up residence across the pond.
Being third in line to the throne, Prince Harry "has virtually no chance of becoming king and could set himself up here and found a Canadian branch of the Royal Family", Boisvert suggested.
It's an odd notion, especially coming from a Francophone Quebecker. While the monarchist love-in is expected to predominate in the rest of Canada, La Belle Province, as it is known, with its history of separatist tension, is the one place royal visitors can expect to feel some resistance.
A small crowd of 100 protesters disrupted the Prince of Wales' last tour in 2009, and it is expected the Duke and Duchess will be forced to keep calm and carry on through more of the same.
The Quebecois Network of Resistance has announced it will demonstrate at Quebec City Hall against the royal visit's cost to tax-payers (which, according to the Monarchist League of Canada, works out to only a few cents per citizen).
But William and Kate would be wise not to take such insults too personally.
The late separatist politician Rene Levesque once said, "I have great respect for the Queen... but what the hell part should monarchy have in Quebec?"
Until recently one could have said the same for the rest of the country. But once Kate and William have their way with us, I suspect Canada will be singing God Save the Queen.

article Ted Cruz will be looking to build on his victory in the Iowa caucuses ahead of the New Hampshire primary election.
Controversial billionaire Donald Trump will be looking to mount a comeback after his second place finish in Iowa.
Marco Rubio came third in Iowa and is seen as a rising force, leading many of his rivals to question his credentials.
The other debaters will be former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Ohio Governor John Kasich and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.
The results of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary are expected to determine whether or not some of the Republican candidates drop out.
The Iowa caucuses narrowed the field, with Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum withdrawing from the race after the results were announced.
ABC News, which is hosting the debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, has dropped an undercard event for low-polling candidates, leaving former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as the only remaining candidate without a spot on stage.
The only woman candidate in the Republican field released an open letter describing the debate process as "broken."
Mr Trump boycotted the final TV debate before the Iowa caucuses, and later demanded a re-run of the state vote after reports that supporters of Mr Cruz, a Texas senator, had told caucus-goers that Mr Carson was dropping out of the race.
The Cruz campaign later apologised to Mr Carson, saying it was a misunderstanding.
Voters will make their choice in both the Republican and Democratic races in New Hampshire on Tuesday.

article The O's were relegated from League One after finishing the season with a seven-game winless run.
"Season's finished, there's no more games, yet we're in training Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs till the 24th May," Orient forward Shaun Batt tweeted.
The east London club have declined to comment.
Orient reached the League One play-off final last season but endured a difficult campaign after being taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti last summer.
The O's had four different managers over the course of the season and were relegated to League Two on the final day after a 2-2 draw at Swindon, dropping into the bottom tier for the first time since 2006.
Manager Fabio Liverani, who was appointed in December, still has two years left on his contract at the Matchroom Stadium and has stated his desire to remain with the club.
Tweeting about the extra training on Monday afternoon, Batt added: "No Family Holidays This Year Boys".
Centre-back Mathieu Baudry also posted about the extra training on Twitter last week, with a hint of sarcasm, saying: "Really looking forward to double training sessions next week."
Both Batt and Baudry were part of the Orient side which was beaten on penalties by Rotherham in the play-off final last May.

article Luke Miller, 26, from the Isle of Wight, was found dead in a swimming pool on the island of Koh Tao.
Col Napa Senatip of Koh Tao police station said the cause was determined following a post-mortem examination.
Luke's mother Sara Cotton told the BBC parents should not allow their children to go to the island.
She said: "This has ripped my heart out... Luke was living the dream out there.
"He had a tattoo saying 'living the dream' and that was what he was doing... I personally didn't want him to go though.
"He had thousands of friends and was a fun-loving son who was just living life to the full.
"If I knew then what I know now about that island, he wouldn't have gone. I would've hidden his passport. I don't think parents should let their kids go out there to this island."
Regarding Mr Miller's death, Col Napa Senatip told the BBC: "According to our investigation, this is not a murder."
In September 2014, two British backpackers, Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were murdered on a beach on the island.
Two migrant workers were found guilty of their murders and sentenced to death last month.
Mr Miller was a brick layer, who had moved to Portsmouth from the Isle of Wight, and was one of seven children.
He left the UK on 22 December to spend Christmas and the New Year on the Thai holiday island.
According to police his body was found on Friday morning at Sunset Bar on Sairee Beach.
Witnesses and CCTV footage at the bar showed he was there until the early hours of the morning.
But the security guards who regularly search the pool for lost belongings after parties did not find Mr Miller when they made a search at 05:30 local time. He was discovered at about 07:20.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokeswoman has confirmed it is providing assistance to his family.
An online appeal to help repatriate Mr Miller's body has so far raised more than Â£7,000.
Ms Cotton said: "I just want him home. All I want now is my son back, no parent should have to go through this.
"I can't thank the person who set up this fundraising page enough, it's amazing what they've done.
"I've paid for my funeral and my husband's already - but you never think you'll have to pay for your son's."

It is hoped it will help to increase people's confidence and independence.
The project has received a grant from the Big Lottery Fund in partnership with the Welsh Government.
Project manager Jenna Trakins, from charity Learning Disability Wales, said: "With only 6% of people with a learning disability and 16% of people with autism currently in full time employment, there is clearly a lot of work ahead of us.
"We have met some inspirational young people on our project who have very clearly demonstrated how their disability does not hold them back from achieving their employment goals."
Max, 26, from Cardiff was diagnosed with autism in 2016 which causes him anxiety.
"I often get very frustrated, especially after receiving rejection from jobs and find it quite difficult to manage these feelings so they often manifest into depression," he said.
"Saying that, I think my autism makes me equally determined to succeed.
"I have been able build up my confidence through placements, I still find interviews quite hard and my confidence and self-esteem can take a knock quite easily, as my autism makes me quite sensitive to rejection.
"I feel employers could be more flexible in their recruitment processes and more could offer alternatives to interviews, which those with autism, including myself, often find very difficult to express themselves in.
"This could be through things such as work trials."

article However, even if that proves a step too far for the Brave Blossoms, they have already made history with the greatest upset at a Rugby World Cup - their stunning victory over 1995 and 2007 champions South Africa.
The Asian underdogs' results since then may not have matched that peak, but rugby union in the country is now on a popular high, and there is a new appetite and interest in the game that bodes well for Japan's hosting of the competition in 2019.
What has been a niche interest has found itself catapulted into the national consciousness, while last week global governing body World Rugby approved a revised tournament plan for 2019, one brought about by issues over where the final would be played in four years' time.
After delays around building a new Olympic Stadium for 2020, which Japan is also hosting, World Rugby has said the 70,000-seat Yokohama Stadium (venue for the 2002 football World Cup final) will host the final of the 2019 rugby competition.
One Japanese business expert, and keen amateur rugby player, believes that the tournament, the first ever to be played in Asia, will provide breakthrough moments for both the sport and the nation.
"In Japan, rugby is not really fully recognised," says Seijiro Takeshita, professor of management and information at the University of Shizuoka, and former captain of the London Japanese Rugby Football Club.
"It is also a pretty difficult game to understand, so I think more recognition of the game would definitely boost the population of people who are going to look into the game. Once they do, they will get hooked."
There was an immediate upturn of interest after the South Africa victory, with nearly 20 million Japanese watching the team's second Rugby World Cup match against Scotland, their first following the stunning upset.
The Scotland match started at 22:15 Japan time and 19.5 million people, some 15% of the population, stayed up to watch.
"I think [the South Africa victory] had an astonishing mega-effect, both outside and in Japan," says Prof Takeshita. "That showed to the world that we can do this. Right now nobody argues that Japan will be hosting the World Cup in 2019."
Prof Takeshita says Japan has already eyed increased tourism as a major target for the economy and that the 2019 World Cup can "certainly give a very strong following wind to that trend, and also recognition that Japan could hold such a big event".
"It would also be a very big advertisement [for Japan] to the rest of the world, so it works very nicely inside and outside of Japan, and I do feel that Japan will make a very good host," he adds.
"Japan is known for its articulate and precise level of, for example, transportation, service, what have you... it is a very business-like community, and I think it a very good opportunity to show to the world that we can do this really, really well.
"It is also an opportunity for Japan to appeal to the world, that this isn't just business, but this is a wonderful place for leisure as well, and you can mix both of them together."
He said that Japan was still not "fully understood" by the rest of the world. "I think this is a very good opportunity for Japan to show that it is not only on the operations side that we can do it, but that the country is a very strong attraction for you to come back to many times later on."
Koji Tokumasu is general manager of the Japan 2019 Rugby World Cup Organising Committee and has been a fan of rugby since he fell in love with the game while studying in Cardiff.
He sees the 2019 World Cup expanding the Japanese rugby participation base - currently focussed on colleges and corporate-affiliated teams - out into the wider sporting public.
He says the host cities will be key in promoting the game, through their schools, civic events, and local government support.
"We are making use of about 20,000 primary schools, and bringing tag [touch] rugby, non-tackling, which the boys and girls can enjoy," he adds. "So by the year 2019, every single child will have touched the ball."
He also said that whereas the 2020 Olympic Games would be held in one city - Tokyo, the Rugby World Cup could bring economic benefits to a number of cities and towns across Japan.
He said as well as the 12 host cities, there would be another 20 training camps, meaning tourist visitors would be visiting a number of communities during the six-week event.
And Mr Tokumasu says that despite the stadium hiccups, the country will deliver a successful Rugby World Cup.
"Of course Japan Rugby is confident to deliver a successful World Cup," he says. "The reason why World Rugby has given us an opportunity to host the World Cup is that rugby should be played outside the traditional unions, such as England, Australia, and South Africa.
"Whenever you have a major event you always have some issues in between, from the beginning to the end... and in the end we [will] just look back and say 'sometimes we had such an issue, but let's enjoy the tournament'."
He adds: "Asia has 60% of the world population, and we really want to make sure the Rugby World Cup in Japan 2019 will contribute to the develop of rugby in Asia, and eventually into the world.
"We have a special mission to make rugby a truly global sport, and that was the very reason we were chosen to host.  And we are going to complete our mission."

Evans, the British number two, was beaten 6-2 6-3 by South Africa's seventh seed Kevin Anderson.
British number three Ward later went down 7-5 6-3 to Bulgarian fourth seed Grigor Dimitrov.
Andy Murray begins his title defence against Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu on Wednesday.
Evans, who beat Austria's world number 51 Jurgen Melzer in the first round on Monday, struggled to make an impact against the big serving of 6ft 8in Anderson and went out in 65 minutes.
An early break of serve put the South African in charge and when he moved 4-2 ahead in the second set, there was no way back for the Briton.
"I didn't get a chance to play tennis, really," said world number 139 Evans, who is targeting a good performance at Eastbourne next week to improve his ranking.
"Next week is a pretty big week. Smaller draw, more ranking points. That's the week you're going to pick up your points."
Evans, 24, added that he was confident he could see off the potential threat of Aljaz Bedene, the Slovenian-born player who hopes to qualify for Britain next year, to his Davis Cup place.
Evans is currently ranked seven places below Bedene, but believes he is "a better player" than the London-based 24-year-old.
"I have nothing against him. I just wouldn't do it personally," Evans added. "He's a nice guy. He's played Davis Cup for a different country. I just don't think it would be right if he played Davis Cup for our country."
Ward set up a meeting with Dimitrov after a 7-5 6-4 win against Slovenia's Blaz Rola on Monday.
The 27-year-old produced a gallant display against the world number 13 but was undone after losing his serve at crucial moments in each set.
Unseeded Australian Marinko Matosevic caused an upset as he beat ninth seed Marin Cilic, the 2012 champion and 2013 runner-up, 6-4 6-4.
Matosevic was asked afterwards what he thought about Murray's decision to work with Amelie Mauresmo, and said: "For me, I couldn't do it since I don't think that highly of the women's game. But his mum coached him, and she did a great job with him."
Mauresmo arrived at Queen's Club on Tuesday ahead of starting work as the new coach of Wimbledon champion Murray.
The 34-year-old Frenchwoman's appointment, initially for the grass-court season, was announced on Sunday.
British number one Murray practised at Queen's on Tuesday morning with Bedene. Dani Vallverdu, Murray's long-time assistant coach, oversaw the session along with fitness trainer Matt Little.

article VisitScotland will follow it up with promotional activity in Germany early next year.
It said the route - officially opened by the Queen last week - had received coverage by media worldwide.
It hopes it can "breathe new life" into the economies of Midlothian and the Borders and help Scotland as a whole.
Mike Cantlay, who chairs VisitScotland, said the start of services was "not only a historic moment for Scotland" but also "a truly global affair" with an audience of millions.
"The magical Scottish Borders is one of Scottish tourism's greatest assets with its rich heritage and beautiful and inspiring landscape," he said.
"The Borders Railway, which delves deep into Sir Walter Scott country, presents a huge opportunity for Scottish tourism to breathe new life into the area, touching on every industry, business and community."
Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown said the railway would "open up a unique and iconic part of the country to visitors".
"Having been there myself at the official opening on Wednesday to sample the atmosphere and feel-good factor I have no doubt that the new line will serve as a catalyst for major investment in the area," he said.
"Not only is the Borders Railway a success by the scale of its ambition, but also for bringing together communities, councils, and government to deliver a challenging infrastructure project both on time and on budget.
"Such vision and collaboration means that the Borders has become a symbol of the renaissance of our railways in Scotland."
Danny Cusick, who chairs the Borders Railway Blueprint Leaders Group, said it hoped to "maximise the economic benefits" of the new rail connection between Edinburgh and Tweedbank.
A ScotRail Alliance spokesperson added: "There's a great buzz about the Borders Railway, particularly after such a successful opening weekend, with more than 2,500 journeys last Sunday alone - the first day of passenger rail services to and from Tweedbank.
"We're pleased to be working with Scottish Rail Preservation Society to run our first-ever steam trains.
"These are proving popular with customers and helping boost the Borders economy.
"Due to the huge demand, we added extra carriages to 16 of our 17 Borders steam trains, with these additional tickets selling out within a week."

article Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said it would support physiotherapists, nurses, radiographers and a range of health science training opportunities.
He said it would enable more than 3,000 new students to join those already studying healthcare in Wales.
The money includes £500,000 for community healthcare.
Peter Meredith-Smith, associate director of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said it had "argued for years" that "investment in community staffing infrastructure in Wales has not kept pace with changing models of care across the country, with a shift of care from hospitals to community settings".
He said: "Clearly it will take a few years for the full effects of this investment to fully bear fruit, with a time-lag between the new money flowing into the system and nurses completing their education and training.
"However, the impact of this announcement on the morale of front-line staff should not be under-estimated."
Keith Lloyd, dean of Swansea University Medical School, said: "I am very grateful to Welsh Government for funding the additional physician associate places so that we can train more people to deliver the NHS workforce for Wales."

article George Lowe, 89, died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness, with his wife Mary by his side.
New Zealand-born Mr Lowe helped Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953.
Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a "gentle soul and fine climber" who shunned the limelight.
Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.
He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.
Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: "We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.
"There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.
"We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop."
He also talked about his "second job" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.
"When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?" he said.
Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a "hero".
"I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one," he said.
A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be published in May.
He said: "Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never sought the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition.
"He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet remained a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all."
Before retiring in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage.
The last British climbing member of the 1953 team, Mike Westmacott, died last June.

"The club has always seen the manager role as closely tied to that of the first team coach and believes that it is essential to have a strong team in place," said a club statement.
"The departure of coach Wayne Carlisle at the end of the season meant the dissolution of the current team.
"It has not been possible to find a replacement acceptable to the club within the required timescale.
"An announcement on a new manager-coach team will be made in due course."

article Officially there are about 1.1 million registered refugees in Lebanon - though the actual figure is believed to be far higher - many of them children.
UK charity Christian Aid has been working with Lebanese organisation Mouvement Social on a photographic project to help young refugees from Syria integrate with Lebanese youth.
The children, aged between 11 and 17, were asked to focus on their "safe space" and what made them happy and to express that in an image.
"Children around the world love photography and these kids were no different," says Tabitha Ross, a photographer based in Beirut who led the project.
"They delighted in taking pictures of each other, family, friends, and the city, and they grew in confidence in their photography throughout the project.
"It was also great to see them instinctively focus on the people, places and things that made them feel happy and comfortable, using the cameras to help them focus on the beauty in life despite everything they have been through."
Here is a selection of the pictures taken by the students, images that come to life when you read the story that inspired them.
Jan, 11, is from a rural area in northern Syria now under Islamic State control. He has been in Beirut since 2012 but still misses the countryside. He liked to photograph birds, trees and greenery, highlighting the nature he loves.
He said: "When I feel upset, I sit and look at nature and feel better."
Teenagers all over the world retreat to their bedrooms when they want personal space, and 15-year-old Kurdish Syrian Lamiss is no different.
She said: "I really feel comfortable in my bedroom. I share it with my sister. I have lots of pictures on the walls. It's where I go if I have nothing to do, or if I want time alone.
"If I were choosing just one picture about my safe space I'd choose this one.  I like it and it makes me feel something strange and special at the same time. Special because I am alone, and what's strange about it is that whenever I'm alone I feel comfortable."
Lebanese Ali, 14, took pictures on the roof of his house, because this is where he feels most secure.  He feels that the streets aren't safe, and both home and the Mouvement Social centre that Ali attends in lieu of school are full of people.
The roof is one of the only places he can be alone and relax, even though there's not much to do up there other than mess about with the hose or water the plants.
He said: "The roof is my safe space.  There's nothing special about it.  Just when I'm upset or angry, I go to the roof and I feel calm because I look at the space and the big buildings."
Beirut's coastline often makes many of the children feel safe.  Aslan, 12, loves going down to the sea with his family.
He said: "I like it that there is sun in the picture and the sea is very calm. I like it when the sky is blue and you can only hear the sound of the sea. Then I feel that everything is calm. And I feel relaxed."
Many children chose to focus on an individual or group of people who made them feel secure.  Alma, the fifth of eight children in her family, photographed her elder brother.
She said: "I really, really love him, and whatever I ask of him he always does for me.  He loves me too."
Several children enjoyed taking pictures of old photographs and using these as a way of depicting their happy memories of safe spaces in Syria.
Stephanie, 14, took this picture of an old snap of her cousin by a little river near her grandfather's land in the countryside near Homs.
She said: "Each and every holiday, we would go to my grandparents' house, and the first thing I'd do in the morning was ask to go there.  I feel like I'm an explorer when I go there."
Many of the children photographed activities within the Mouvement Social centre, where they go every day and see their friends, teachers and the counsellor.  Noody, 15, took this picture of the younger children in a drama class.
He said: "They were relaxed and it was a safe space so I wanted to take a picture."
Leila, 11, photographed the view from her window through a transparent curtain embroidered with flowers.
She said: "This means that I like flowers, and the clouds, and the area I live in. And it says that I like high places. I feel comfortable when I look at the sky. I really like the clouds."
Jihan, 15, from the Aleppo countryside, took a series of pictures of the view from her balcony at home, followed by one of her looking out over the city.
She said: "I really feel comforted when I look at the sky.  I don't know why, but it looks clear and it makes me feel clear."
In this way, Jihan finds her own sense of space and freedom.
Ibo, 17, told the story of a safe space within Syria - a cave he and his family had dug out as a bomb shelter when the area they lived in came under heavy attack.
He took pictures of old photographs taken at the time.
He said : "This is me and my littlest sister, in the days when we were living in the cave.  We made it very warm and cosy in there. Inside, the temperature was always the opposite of outside  - in summer it was cool, and in winter it was warm. We used to sleep in there. We couldn't feel the difference between day and night, because there was no light."
Hayleen, 14, is from an area of Syria that has seen heavy fighting and experienced a lot of bombing.  Her family had to leave their house and live in a school that had been turned into a collective shelter, with many other families, for several months before fleeing to Beirut.
She brought her teddy bear through all of this.
She said: "I can't sleep without this, I don't know why. I love it a lot. I've had it since I was really small.  I brought it with me when I came to Lebanon."
Technology allows young people to maintain the bonds linking them to family still in Syria, using communication to establish each other's safety. Rania, from Aleppo, took images from the instant messaging service WhatsApp.
She said: "I like WhatsApp and use it to stay in touch with people. This is a picture of my phone showing a love heart that was sent to me from someone I love a lot. I took these pictures because they show the connections between me and my family in Syria."
You can read more about each picture and other stories about those featured on Beirut Friends: Our Life in Pictures. The work is soon to be exhibited in Beirut.
The names of the children have been changed.

article The meeting took place on Mr Obama's last St Patrick's Day as president.
Depending on the outcome of negotiations to form a new government in the Republic of Ireland, it could also be Mr Kenny's last as taoiseach.
However, Mr Kenny told Vice President Joe Biden that Ireland would be able to put together a stable government during the next "short period ahead".
The recent general election in the Republic was mentioned several times during speeches from both men.
Mr Biden said that he was surprised at the outcome saying "he [Mr Kenny] did a hell of a job, is still the most popular guy, and he lost".
Mr Biden said Mr Kenny had assured him that it was "going to work out".
Speaking to reporters after visiting the Oval Office, Mr Kenny said Fine Gael is talking to like-minded parties and individuals on government formation and is working on drawing-up a set of priorities.
"We're actually determining our set of priorities that will be important in the discussions that Fine Gael will have in putting together a government," he said.
"Some of that comes from our own programme, some of it comes from the parties and the alliances that we've been talking to.
"And some of it clearly comes from the concerns raised by people during the course of the election, like housing and homelessness, health issues and so on."
He added: "We expect to have that finalised next week and that gives us really the basis for negotiations and for discussions about putting a government together."
At the White House, Mr Kenny presented the traditional bowl of shamrock to President Obama.
The bowl was hand-cut at the House of Waterford Crystal factory in Ireland.
He also presented the president with a pair of cuff links modelled on the buttons of the coat Michael Collins was wearing when he was killed, and a collection of poetry and art celebrating the centenary of the 1916 Rising.
Michelle Obama was given a ring designed by Paul Kelly, inspired by the Ring of Kerry, and a hamper of Irish food items.
Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, received two Newbridge Silver compact mirrors.
Mr Kenny will return to Ireland for a short time on Wednesday before travelling to Brussels for a European Council meeting on St Patrick's Day.

Former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, who leads GERB, said the party had the "duty to form a government".
Official results are expected on Monday but Socialist Party leader Kornelia Ninova has already conceded victory.
Sunday's election was the third in four years.
Mr Borisov, 57, resigned as prime minister after his party lost the November 2016 presidential election.
A caretaker administration took over after parliament was dissolved in January and will remain in place until a new government is formed.
Mr Borisov said GERB would endeavour to form a government quickly with coalition partners.
The Socialists have ruled out being part of any power-sharing agreement with GERB.
Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007 and is one of its poorest member states. It is also a member of Nato.

The study by the Atlantic Council, published on Thursday, claims to have tracked Russian involvement in the conflict using photographs, videos and satellite images posted online.
President Putin's move to ban information about peacetime military deaths comes amid fears of a fresh offensive by Russian-backed separatists.
Reuters reporters said they had observed this week Russia's army massing troops and weaponry - including mobile rocket launchers, tanks and artillery - at a makeshift base in Kuzminsky, near the border with Ukraine.
The news agency said many of the vehicles had number plates and identifying marks removed, while servicemen had taken insignia off their fatigues - similar to some unidentified forces seen in eastern Ukraine.
A ceasefire agreement was signed in Minsk in February, but heavy fighting has continued in some areas since then.
Before the amendment was signed by Mr Putin on Wednesday, the loss of troops was a state secret only in wartime.
The decree gives no details of what is meant by "special operations".
For months there have been reports of secret burials of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Russian blogger Ruslan Leviyev said he had found three graves of Russian  officers killed by shelling in eastern Ukraine on 5 May.
Meanwhile the authors of the Atlantic Council report - including British weapons analyst Eliot Higgins - say satellite images have confirmed the movement of Russian troops and camp build-ups along the Ukrainian border.
They say Russian training camps are being used as "the staging ground" for military equipment and soldiers to be transported into Ukraine.
The most recent photograph analysed in the Atlantic Council report was taken in February.
The Kremlin has denied Western accusations that its forces are directly involved in combat, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are "volunteers".
How many Russians are fighting in Ukraine?
Russian reporters 'attacked at secret soldier burials'
On Wednesday Russia's ambassador in Ukraine visited two men, who were captured by Kiev and accused of being elite Russian soldiers operating in the Luhansk region.
The Kremlin had demanded access to Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Yevgeny Yerofeyev, complaining that their situation was being exploited as propaganda.
The pair were charged by Kiev with involvement in "terrorist activity", after apparently confirming in video statements that they were active Russian servicemen.
Moscow said they were not serving "at the moment they were detained".
But Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told the BBC that the soldiers were proof that his country was engaged in a "real war" with Russia, rather than pro-Russian separatists.
He said Ukrainians should prepare for a Russian offensive in the coming months.
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called for an end to snap exercises by Russia close to the Ukrainian border, and demanded Russia be "more transparent when it comes to their military activities".

article The fire happened at a garage on the Stewartstown Road in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The fire service said the blaze was contained to single building and did not spread to the petrol pumps.
It said that the cause of the fire is not yet known. It is understood residents returned to their homes at about 06:00 GMT.
The fire is now out.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Stephen Magennis said he understood that no one was hurt in the blaze and that six or seven houses were evacuated as part of the operation.
Mr Magennis said that after being told about the fire shortly after 02:00 he looked out his bedroom window and "could see the flames over the top of the houses".
"When I made my way round, the police and fire brigade were evacuating houses that were backing on to the garage, and they informed me the actual garage building was engulfed.
"Obviously with the garage and the fuel and everything else, it became a big worry.
"The police sealed off the Stewartstown Road, part of Foxes Glen and Twinbrook as well.
"I have to say the police and the fire brigade put on a fairly professional operation, getting people out safe, getting them into places and also securing the area."
He added: "I would say residents were probably in shock because of what had happened, especially the intensity of the fire at the back of their homes.
"One resident told me that she went down to get a glass of water, saw the whole garage building on fire and then alerted the fire brigade. She was saying, if she hadn't come down would anybody have seen it?
"So people were fairly in shock, very worried and fearful."

article A total off 110 people were sentenced to a restriction of liberty order in 2014-15, compared to 44 in 2010-11.
The Scottish government said the increase could reflect a greater emphasis on tackling the problem from police and prosecutors.
The Conservatives said it should not be an alternative to jail for abusers.
The party's justice spokesman Douglas Ross, who requested the data from the Scottish Parliament, said: "Domestic abuse is a horrendous crime and the punishment handed down by the courts must protect both victims and the public."
He added: "Electronic tagging is certainly a useful tool in the box in this regard, but we need to avoid a situation where it is being used as a means to reduce the prison population when even a short custodial sentence might be more appropriate.
"The Scottish government also needs an integrated approach to domestic abuse offenders which focuses on public protection on the one hand, and rehabilitation on the other."
The Scottish government said an extra Â£20m was being invested over three years in addition to Â£11.8m annual funding to tackle violence against women, including domestic abuse.
A spokesman said: "This has already boosted resources to courts and crown to reduce court waiting times for domestic abuse cases while we have also extended measures to support vulnerable witnesses, such as giving evidence via video link, with automatic access to such support for alleged victims of domestic abuse.
"Evidence indicates that community sentences, including electronic monitoring, are more effective at reducing reoffending than short prison sentences, part of the reason why Scotland currently has the lowest reconviction rate in 16 years.
"Clearly, we are listening to the views of family members affected by people who are tagged as we consider how to take forward electronic monitoring in Scotland."

article Businesses generally have had "a very encouraging start" to 2016, according to data compiled for Ulster Bank.
In January, the pace of job creation among the companies surveyed was above the UK average for the first time in almost two years.
The bank said manufacturing was a key area of concern.
Its chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said "doom and gloom" in the global economy will impact further on Northern Ireland manufacturing in the months ahead.
The bank produces a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) each month which records things like new orders, employment and exports.
Mr Ramsey said job losses had been reported in the manufacturing sector for a fifth month running.
"Manufacturing orders have been flat or falling in four of the last five months.
"January's decline represented the sharpest fall since September 2012."
The services sector was "the star performer" last month.

article Now, if re-elected to the European Parliament, the West Midlands Labour group is promising to apply to get it protected by the European Union.
It would mean a Staffordshire oatcake could only be called one if it was made in the county, using the right ingredients and method.
Candidate Sion Simon said: "They're part of our heritage and culture in the West Midlands, and they should be protected in the same way other European countries protect their food products."
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats said they were also broadly supportive of the plan, but UKIP says it should be up to the UK, not Europe, to decide on which of its own products should be protected.
The Staffordshire oatcake should not be confused with its Scottish counterpart, which is a flat oaty biscuit.
It is made from a "secret recipe" of largely oatmeal and yeast and can be filled with anything sweet or savoury, although the most popular is cheese and bacon.
Staffordshire Oatcakes recipe
Staffordshire foods
It has the appearance of a moist pancake or crepe - as Stoke-on-Trent poet and author Arthur Berry put it, a "Potteries Poppadom," or a "Tunstall Tortilla".
Jane Gavin sends oatcakes "all around the country from Scotland to Cornwall" from her shop in High Lane in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.
"I think it would help protect the brand of Staffordshire Oatcakes like it has with pork pies and various cheeses," she said.
"It would stop people pinching the idea and recipes, setting up shop in somewhere like the middle of London, and passing them off as from Staffordshire."
But Martyn Smith, who runs Foley Oatcakes in Fenton, does not believe that any companies outside the county would try to muscle in on the product.
"I wonder whether the oatcake does need protection because I've tried to sell them outside North Staffordshire and failed," he said.
"I've been to various market places and tried to sell filled oatcakes and the only people that purchased from us are ex-potters."
Caroline Pugh is another who is not impressed with the protection idea because her oatcake shop is just over the Staffordshire border, in Congleton, Cheshire.
She said: "If all oatcakes had to be made in Staffordshire it wouldn't do us any favours, this is our livelihood, we would have to diversify or find a way round it."
PDO - Protected Designation of Origin
A product which has a very distinctive process, recipe or method closely linked to a specific area and gaining features and characteristics from it e.g. Swaledale ewes' cheese
PGI - Protected Geographical Indication
A product which has a distinctive process, recipe or method linked to a specific area e.g. Worcestershire cider
TSG - Traditional Speciality Guaranteed
A product which has distinctive process, recipe or method not connected with a location e.g. Traditional Farm fresh Turkey
Protected food names: Quality or cartel?
"We've had our shop for 20 years since moving here from Kidsgrove [Stoke-on-Trent]. We make all our oatcakes on site here from a traditional family recipe and get a lot of custom from Stokies."
It was a similar story for many Cornish pasty makers in Devon when it was given protected status in 2011.
Figures published in March showed pasty production has almost doubled since 2005 and the market was now worth Â£300m.
James Strawbridge from the Posh Pasty Company in Fowey said: "It's for tourists, it's for people buying it on the other side of the country.
"If they see the words Cornish Pasty that helps them trace the journey from start to finish, buy into the history, the local reputation and that means more sales for the Cornish economy.
"We're finding that consumers around the country are now a little bit more aware of the difference between a pasty and a Cornish pasty and it's actually helping sales."
But Matthew Rippon, an expert on protected food names said that the laws do not always benefit producers.
He said: "Once you have protected status you have to abide by the regulations which are fairly inflexible, so if you wanted to add a new ingredient or modify your method of production, legally you couldn't.
"Even if Staffordshire oatcakes are made with a secret recipe enough information needs to be revealed in order to have a product description which every producer would have to agree on."

article Arsene Wenger has been in charge of Arsenal for 21 years but a disastrous week has perhaps left his future in more doubt than at any other time during his reign.
A seventh successive exit at the last-16 stage of the Champions League was painful enough, without the added humiliation of a 10-2 aggregate hammering by Bayern Munich.
The protests against Wenger have rumbled in the background for years but now seem to have an extra fervency.
Throughout all this, a new contract offer remains on the table, while the 67-year-old says the opinion of fans will influence his decision over whether to remain in charge.
So BBC Sport asked Arsenal fans for their views, and this is what they told us...
Media playback is not supported on this device
Wenger is consistently unfairly criticised because the media, and many fans, are used to and desire newness and change rather than stability. He has said something similar himself. Liverpool have never won the Premier League and Manchester United have dropped out of the Champions League but they have both had more than one new manager in Wenger's time and so are spared criticism. A top-four place is still achievable, as is a cup win, which is more than most clubs will achieve. Roger, Norwich
Disgusting behaviour towards a great and loyal manager. This man has made Arsenal an iconic club over the last 20 years and was never caught up in the ridiculous transfer markets of la-la land. Empty vessels make the most noise as seen in this week's protest - and if he goes they'll never see a greater manager at board and bench level. Denis Taylor, Falkirk
My hope is that he announces that he is parting ways with the club at the end of the season. That will make sure all the fans get behind him and give him the send-off he deserves
The reason I support Arsenal is Arsene Wenger - a man who understands that football is about entertainment and occasionally it is about art and beauty. It is not all about winning. I go to football to be entertained, maybe even moved. If I was only interested in the result I would stay at home and check the results online. I know many older fans like me who feel the same. I would like Wenger to stay forever but I feel, sadly, that he'll get fed up with all of this noise and take his genius and love of football elsewhere and English football will be so much the poorer. Liz Heade, Cambridge
Arsene Wenger has not only transformed Arsenal, but he has also played a significant role in the transformation of English football. Equally he has won a trophy every season, as I believe qualifying for Europe equates to a fourth trophy in the top flight. Arsenal need to decide who they are and what they want to be and get the right people to deliver their strategy. Wenger needs to prove he can reinvent the club but he has earned the right to say when he leaves. Chris McShane, Salisbury
OK, things have gone stale. We are not really improving and we no longer seem able to challenge for the top honours despite early-season promise. But the escalation of anger and the barrage of abuse against Wenger, especially from the club's younger supporters, is absolutely vile. They must never forget that people from my generation grew up and their passions for that club grew because of that one man. I do think he will go at the at end of the season, but it will be a sad day when he does and all our supporters need to treat him and what he has done for Arsenal with a little bit more respect and acknowledgement.  Asser Ghozlan, Kent
When I started supporting Arsenal at four years old, Wenger was already into his second season. The fact that the manager's name was Arsene and the club was Arsenal was, in my mind then, no coincidence. There are plenty of millennials out there who, like me, have known no Arsenal without Arsene. His philosophy has come to define Arsenal. When he goes, we will be forced to discover who we are without him. And, in football, it is infinitely harder to find an identity than it is a trophy. Dhev, London

Arsene Wenger has been a wonderful manager. He will go down in history as one of the greats in the history of this football club. But nobody goes on forever, and Arsene has overstayed his welcome. Sadly, he's now become the root of a lot of the issues at our club. Arsenal are having the same season yet again. There is only one way to break the cycle and it requires Wenger to realise that this is what the end looks like, because the board won't help him find that realisation. You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain. And Wenger has now become the villain, who needs saving from himself. Rhys Hardstaff, Palmerston North, New Zealand
Wenger has to leave. There can be no room for sentimentality. Let's all not forget this is a man who has become a multi-millionaire through his endeavours for the club. In any other job if you were taking things backwards your job would be on the line. Huzefa Ishaki, Peterborough
Wine can take years to mature and be at its best, after which it starts to deteriorate and go bitter and needs throwing out. We're approaching, if not already at, this latter stage. Gerry Ryan, Hamilton, Bermuda
It has been evident for a while that Arsene Wenger cannot take this team to the next level, but he is convinced otherwise. The whole premise of the move to the Emirates was to compete in Europe but that is still a distant dream. What Arsenal fans want right now is a bit of clarity on the future. If Arsene intends to stay then he should sign the contract and that will make up the minds of a lot of players as well. Rohail, York
I am really concerned that his legacy will be tainted if he stays. I've been a supporter for over 46 years and seen plenty of good times, and my son - aged 23 - can't remember Arsenal not being involved in the Champions League, which is under threat this season. When Arsene came to Arsenal in 1996 he brought a revolution to English football. Unfortunately he hasn't moved with the times and there has been no improvement in performance over the last 10 years. Jonathan Stevens, Prudhoe
I was never in the 'Wenger out' camp until recently. But it's evident he's lost his touch. I believe Wenger is only part of the problem; the board have to take some responsibility - fourth is not a trophy. Chris Gilson, Colchester
I personally think that Wenger should have left the club since 2009. Doing the same thing over and over and over but expecting a different result is plain insanity. Jovita Nsoh, Houston, USA
I have wanted Arsene Wenger out for 10 years. The Bayern Munich result was embarrassing and it is just adding to the list. No club has a divine right to win trophies but with what we pay and the stature of the club we have a divine right to compete. Nick Bowler, Rochester
The uncertainty surrounding the club has split the fanbase and stalled the players' contract negotiations. My hope as an Arsenal fan is that he announces that he is parting ways with the club at the end of the season. That will make sure all the fans get behind him and give him the send-off he deserves. Alexius Mukanganyama, Johannesburg, South Africa
Wenger - stay or go? I can see the argument for both sides. On one hand it is frustrating not being able to compete for the title, with the annual February/March collapse and Champions League exit. Although the football we play is beautiful when we get it right, it can be embarrassingly bad when we get it wrong. But there is no certainty a new manager will improve the club. After thinking long and hard, I've decided I want Wenger to stay. We are still there or thereabouts in a very competitive league and we need to start buying more world-class players by spending some of the reported pile of cash in the bank.  Jonathan Bulmer, Stockport

article On Friday, the hacker known as "Guccifer 2.0" released contact details of 193 current and ex-Congress members.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi later told colleagues she had received "obscene and sick calls" after her phone number was leaked.
Twitter declined to comment on the reasons for the suspension and subsequent reinstatement.
Wordpress also blocked some content on Guccifer's blog which has not been reinstated.
The episode is the latest in a series of leaks of Democratic Party data claimed by Guccifer - including a dump of more than 19,000 emails from Democratic National Committee (DNC) members, which was published via whistle-blowing website Wikileaks in July.
Technical analysis of that leak revealed some suggestions that the source had links to Russia - and US intelligence officials have also asserted such a link.
However, Guccifer has denied accusations that he or she is associated with the Russian state.
Upon returning to Twitter, Guccifer tweeted: "Here I am! They'll have to try much harder to block me!"
Twitter declined to comment on the reasons for the suspension and subsequent reinstatement.
"I am changing my phone number, and I advise you to do so as well," senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to party colleagues.
"On a personal note, I was in the air flying from Florida to California when the news broke.
"Upon landing, I have received scores of mostly obscene and sick calls, voicemails and text messages."
Besides contact information, the latest leak contained documents relating to the election campaign and details about some Democratic politicians' staff members.
The FBI is leading an investigation into the leaks.

article The boy was visiting his father in the east of the city on Monday when he took a handgun from the bedroom.
He is said to have thrown the gun out into the back garden, retrieved it and jumped into a parked car.
Later, the three-year-old boy went into the car, was then shot in the face and later died, prosecutors say.
The older boy appeared in a juvenile court for a preliminary hearing on Wednesday afternoon.
He faces another two charges of death by weapon aimed with intent, but without malice, and felony firearm.
"I cannot remember a time when we have charged someone so young with taking a life," said prosecutor Kym Worthy in a statement.
"Very unfortunately and very tragically, the alleged facts in this case demanded it."
But experts who spoke to the Detroit Free Press newspaper said it was not clear whether an 11-year-old could be competent enough to face such charges.
In Michigan, prosecutors have wide discretion to charge people of any age, though the judge has some say in the process, the paper says.
But prosecutors would have to prove that a youth, in this case 11 years old, had "criminal intent".

But Blackpool were level after 25 minutes when Potts was played through in the area and calmly slotted home.
Gary Bowyer's side were ahead 14 minutes later as full-back Kelvin Mellor somehow looped the ball over visiting goalkeeper Marko Marosi from the right by-line.
The Seasiders then took full control of the game with two goals inside the opening three minutes of the second half. Midfielder Potts dispatched a thunderbolt of a free-kick into the bottom corner to make it 3-1 before Kyle Vassell broke and curled past Marosi from 18 yards.
Darren Ferguson's side were offered a lifeline after 65 minutes when Tommy Rowe converted from the penalty spot after being fouled in the area by Jack Payne.
Rowe had a chance to further reduce the deficit five minutes from time but his second spot-kick was saved by Sam Slocombe after the keeper had fouled John Marquis.

article It was found in sealed bags in a lorry on the Moorfields Road, Ballymena, County Antrim, in May last year.
James Kennedy, 25, from Adelaide Road, Kensington, Liverpool, was arrested in Manchester airport on Friday.
A detective constable told the court she believed the defendant was part of an organised crime gang in England.
She understood the gang was bringing drugs into Northern Ireland for supply in the Republic of Ireland.  She said she had serious concerns about the lifestyle of the defendant.  He was arrested as he returned from a six-week stay in Barcelona where his aunt lives.
The detective constable told the court that mobile phone records suggested he had been in Dubai, New York and the Bahamas.
"It doesn't add up to what he earns - £250-£300 a week," the court was told.
A defence lawyer said the only evidence that the prosecution case had was a fingerprint on a box found in the lorry in Ballymena.  There was no DNA from the accused on any of the bags of cannabis.
Police confirmed there was nothing to link him to the driver of the lorry who is currently on bail.
The court heard there was an innocent explanation in that Mr Kennedy was a car mechanic and handles a lot of boxes. The  court heard he had a personal sum of money amounting to £32,000 for a car which he later sold for £17,000.
Bail was refused.  Mr Kennedy is due to appear in court again on 2 February.

article The accident happened in 2009 during a play dress rehearsal at the County Londonderry school.
The family had sued the Western Education and Library Board (WELB) for alleged negligence.
A judge ruled that the school had appropriately supervised the rehearsal.
The judge told the court that he backed the family's account that the child had lost sight in his left eye because he was struck by a girl holding a wand, who was said to have been casting a spell at the time.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been onstage with almost 200 other pupils getting ready for a performance.
However, the judge held that teachers had properly assessed the wand and dismissed the claim.
He said: "I do not consider the plaintiff has established any fault on the part of the defendant."
The judge praised the boy and his mother for the honesty of their evidence, but added there was "overwhelming evidence" that the girl who was holding the fairy wand was "timid and not likely to behave in an inappropriate way".

article Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali survived the blast unhurt after it struck the newly re-opened national theatre in the capital, Mogadishu.
Militants from the al-Shabab group say they carried out the bombing.
African Union peacekeepers said the "despicable" attack would not deter peace efforts in Somalia.
The President of the Somali Olympic Committee, Aden Yabarow Wiish, and the Somali Football Federation chief, Said Mohamed Nur, were both killed. They were among a group of dignitaries who had gathered to mark the first anniversary of the launch of Somalia's national television station.
By Mohamed DhoreBBC News, Mogadishu
There is shock and anger in Mogadishu following the explosion at the Somali national theatre - a little more than two weeks after it was re-opened with great fanfare. The prime minister was addressing the crowd of about 300 high-profile guests gathered to celebrate a year since the government-owned TV station took to the air - meant to be yet another milestone in Somalia's slow return to peace.
But scenes of chaos ensued when a blast ripped through seats. The rescue effort was haphazard and some wounded journalists say they were left to organise their own lifts to hospital.
Police say initial investigations point to a female suicide bomber as being behind the explosion, but the Islamist group al-Shabab said it had planted a device at the theatre ahead of the event, which was announced on television on Tuesday night.
All guests were thoroughly frisked as they entered the theatre, so suspicions are growing that it may have been an inside job. It has also prompted people to question why officials would publicise the event when the government is unable to guarantee security - even for its own prime minister.
Sepp Blatter, president of football's governing body Fifa, said he was shocked at the deaths of the sport officials.
"I knew both men personally and can only say good things about their endless efforts to promote sport and football in their country," he said in a statement. "They will be sorely missed."
Three Somali television journalists were also wounded in the blast, sources told the BBC Somali Service.
The theatre had closed in the early 1990s as Somalia descended into civil war and was only reopened last month, amid a new period of relative optimism.
Police and hospital sources told BBC News in Mogadishu that eight people had been killed.
Also speaking to the BBC, the prime minister said a woman suicide attacker had carried out the attack.
Condemning al-Shabab, he said it was in the group's nature to "kill innocent people" and described the attacks as "the last breaths of a dying horse".
Abdullahi Yussuf Abdurahiman, 22, survived the explosion. He told BBC News: "I saw mutilated bodies, shoes on the ground, bloody mobile phones and chairs cut in half by the force of the blast.
"A lot of people were being carried out and there were dead people on the floor. It was unimaginable. Then everyone was running away."
Soldiers started shooting after the blast, witnesses said.
In a statement al-Shabab said it was behind the bombing but referred to a planted device rather than a suicide bomber.
"The Mujahideen successfully planted the explosives before the gathering," it said on Twitter.
Al-Shabab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Reuters news agency: "We were behind the theatre blast. We targeted the infidel ministers and legislators, and they were the casualties of today."
The explosion comes as the UN-backed government seeks to show it has re-established control of the city since al-Shabab was forced out in August.
However, al-Shabab has continued to attack the capital with bombs and mortars.
Last week, African Union (AU) troops said they had seized control of territory on the outskirts of Mogadishu which, they said, had allowed the Islamist fighters to launch their frequent attacks on the city.
Brigadier General Audace Nduwumunsi, deputy commander of the AU mission said the peacekeepers stood firmly with the Somali government.
"Yet again the terrorists' methods show that they are enemies of peace and are foreign to Somali culture," he said.
"By their attack they are trying to derail the hopes and dreams of the Somali people but they will fail."
He encouraged people in Mogadishu to come forward with any information about possible further attacks.

article Jared Kushner said all of his "actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events" of the campaign.
Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia.
He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy.
He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been "fully transparent in providing all the requested information".
"Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts," he said.
Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.
In a statement to both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were "hardly any" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were "perhaps four".
He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton.
Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was "time not well-spent".
Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided.
In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.
He says the first form, a "rough draft that still had many omissions", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months "in the normal course".
Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed.
Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is "happy" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal.
He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign.
Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals.
He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent.
The incomplete security form was the result of a "miscommunication" with an assistant who submitted it too soon.
Beyond that, there are no new revelations; no new disclosures. If what's already out is all there is, Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs. When walking in a minefield, it's the ones you don't know about that pose the greatest risk.
President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.
He continued his tirade against the investigation process on Sunday, tweeting: "As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!"
Russia has also denied any involvement.
summary Trump's campaign chairman has denied any collusion with Russian officials in the 2016 election.

article The number of pupils hurting themselves is said to be at a high.
NHS figures obtained by BBC Newsbeat show a 20% rise in the number of 10 to 19-years-olds admitted to hospital because of self harm injuries across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The government says it has asked experts to examine how to tackle self-harming and related issues in schools.
The NHS figures show the number of hospital admissions rose from 22,978 in 2012-13 to 28,730 in the following year.
Figures for Scotland were not available.
According to the National Association of Head Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, spending cuts to local services have left schools without as much expert medical help as in the past.
Dr Max Davie, a spokesperson for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), says feeling pressured at school, or by friends, family and the media can all play their part in why young people self harm.
"[These figures] are very worrying," he said.
"We have to remember that people self harm because they're in psychological distress that's so severe that they prefer physical harm or physical pain to their psychological state.
"So the real question is why are more young people experiencing unbearable psychological distress?
"They are often isolated and if that isolation is extended to their own families that can be very serious and damaging.
"There aren't enough services. If they reach out and talk about their problems there is often no-one there who is able to listen who is able to address their issues".
Holly Rabey, 18, from Plymouth, was only 12 when she first started to hurt herself.
"I started because I was bullied in school which caused a lot of anxiety.
"It went from scratches on my forearms to deeper cuts on my wrists and my legs, on my sides, on my stomach.
"I sometimes bruised myself. I would sometimes burn myself as well.
At her lowest point Holly was admitted to hospital after overdosing.
"I was in my bedroom. I'd had a terrible day at college and I started cutting myself on my wrists and I was very, very scared of myself and what I was doing.
"There was a lot of blood and I felt like I needed a way out.
"I felt like I needed to die."
Holly was saved after being taken to hospital by paramedics and treated for her overdose.
After getting help from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services with both therapy and medication she managed to turn herself around and is now enjoying university life in Plymouth.
"I did find some true friends and I've been through a lot but it was meeting my girlfriend and getting engaged, experiencing life and knowing it is worth living so that's who I am now and I'm very happy with it."
Caroline Kolek, a secondary school teacher and spokesperson for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: "My experience in schools and talking to colleagues is that we are seeing a rise in self harm, predominantly among girls but also among boys as well.
"My reaction to those figures is disappointment really. We recognise anxiety and depression is on the rise among young people.
"Unfortunately there is a correlation [between the figures and] a decrease in funding for mental health services - we've lost our emotional wellbeing workers who used to come into schools, we've lost youth workers and there is certainly a massive underfunding in mental health services for young people so many aren't getting the support, and their families, aren't getting the support they need.
"We schools really don't have the support we had four or five years ago."
"When it comes to social media I certainly wouldn't demonise [any network]. I don't think at the moment we fully understand the role social media plays in the rise of self harm among young people," she added.
"I am aware of young people who have self harmed and then put photographs up on social media and they have had very negative comments which has led to bullying. And they've had copycat scenarios."
The government has responded to claims that cuts in local services mean schools are struggling to cope with self harm.
Care Minister Norman Lamb said: "Self harm is a sign of serious emotional distress and it is crucial that young people get the help they need.
"I've brought together a team of specialists to look at how we can improve care - including in our schools - and we are investing Â£150m over the next five years to help young people deal with issues like self-harm and eating disorders."

article The council is looking at how to make cuts of £67m by 2017.
The Accounts Commission said the council needed to develop a comprehensive strategy for managing its staff.
The council insisted it would make the savings and is currently carrying out a consultation exercise to discover ways of doing so.
The Accounts Commission report highlights the growing problems facing the council in balancing its books.
Edinburgh council currently spends about £950m a year.
Its forecast for the amount of extra savings it expects to have found by 2017 grew from £17m last year to £67m this year.
Overall, the council anticipates having to save about £138m by 2017.
One issue at stake is the balance between how much can be saved by internal reforms and efficiency savings - which the public may not notice - and how much will need to come from straightforward cuts in services.
The argument is that internal reforms and efficiencies can help avoid cuts to frontline services.
The Accounts Commission said the council had made some progress in finding savings since it last looked at the local authority last year, and it has noticed improvements in services.
However, the commission said the council had still to develop a comprehensive workforce strategy - something it recommended last year. The commission believes this has a fundamental role to play ensuring the council can meet the challenges it faces.
Like all councils, Edinburgh faces a twin dilemma. Some costs and the demand for certain services is still rising, while budgets are tight. Councils are under a legal obligation to balance their books.
One option from the council's consultation on budget cuts and savings includes a big cut in the amount of money being given to the organisation that runs the capital's sport and leisure centres.
Critics fear this will mean closures, and job losses. Library opening hours are also facing a reduction.
Privately, some at Edinburgh council are believed to feel the timing of the Accounts Commission report is unfortunate as it draws attention to savings they already knew they had to make and comes ahead of the publication of far-reaching proposals for internal change.
The council is expected to unveil proposals later this week to change the way some local services are delivered.
The City of Edinburgh Council's chief executive Sue Bruce said: "The commission's findings acknowledge the progress that the council has made in key areas such as stronger governance throughout the organisation.
"The report rightly highlights the financial challenges the council faces, and acknowledges that the council has already put in place the transformation plan to tackle these issues, to ensure we deliver the best services and maximum value for money for the people of Edinburgh.
"As we move forward into 2015, developing an effective workforce strategy will be a priority for the leadership team and current recommendations on a new delivery model for the council represent an important step forward in this respect.
"This is a challenging time for all local authorities. The City of Edinburgh Council faces tougher financial challenges than many others, due to the city's growing population and its demographics. Our plans recognise the challenges we face, some of which are legacy issues, and we expect to deliver significant progress over the next 12 months."
The public consultation on Edinburgh's budget proposals runs until next month. Councillors will reach a decision in February.

article General Ali Fadavi accused those detained of "unprofessional" acts.
But he suggested the group, who are being held by the guards, could be released soon.
The incident comes at a sensitive time, as the US and Iran try to implement the deal on Iran's nuclear activities.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has contacted Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif over the incident.
Giving his assessment of the talks, Gen Fadavi said "Mr Zarif had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and saying that they [the US] should apologise".
"This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, according to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives," he added.
This naval incident comes at a delicate moment for both Washington and Tehran.
The process to begin lifting the sanctions imposed on Iran due to its nuclear activities is expected to get under way at the end of this week.
There are many conservatives and hardliners in both countries who would dearly love to sabotage the deal and consequently both governments may be eager - whatever the attendant rhetoric -  to get this episode resolved as quickly as possible.
How it plays out will be an important signal as to the balance of power in Tehran itself.
The Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose naval branch detained the US vessels and their crews,  is amongst the more hardline elements ranked up against the nuclear deal.
But the potential economic benefits of lifting the sanctions may be too great an inducement for the agreement to be derailed now.
US officials have said the sailors - nine men and a woman - are likely to be released on Wednesday. There has been no confirmation from Washington that Mr Kerry apologised.
One of the two US riverine patrol boats developed mechanical problems while on a training mission between Bahrain and Kuwait, the US officials added.
The crew and vessels have been taken to Farsi Island, the site of an Iranian naval base.
Iran's influential Revolutionary Guard - tasked with protecting the country's 1979 Islamic revolution - has strongly defended Iranian sea borders in the past.
Fifteen British sailors and marines were held for 13 days in 2007 after they were captured in a disputed area between Iran and Iraq.
Despite last year's breakthrough nuclear deal tensions remain between the US and Iran.
In December, Iran's navy conducted rocket tests near US warships in the Strait of Hormuz, something the US called "highly provocative".

article Zsigmond's business partner, Yuri Neyman, said he died on Friday in Big Sur, California.
The film-maker won an Oscar for Steven Spielberg's 1977 film Close Encounters and was nominated again a year later for The Deer Hunter.
He was also revered as an architect of the American New Wave in the 1970s.
Hungarian-born Zsigmond first gained renown for his collaboration with maverick director Robert Altman on his films McCabe and Mrs Miller and The Long Goodbye.
He went on to work with many of cinema's most celebrated film-makers and became one of Hollywood's most admired cinematographers, thanks to his contributions on films such as Blow Out, Deliverance, The River and Images.
The most recent of his four Oscar nominations came in 2007 for The Black Dahlia. He also shot a number of episodes of the Fox sitcom The Mindy Project.
In 2003, Zsigmond ranked among the 10 most influential cinematographers in film history in a survey conducted by the International Cinematographers Guild.
Guild president Steven Poster said in a statement: "Vilmos' genius was not only in his images, but in his sense of duty to honest storytelling. Working up close with him, I also learned about perseverance and an obligation to the story from the master.
"His brave beginnings providing footage from the Hungarian revolution will always be an important part of his legacy and to future generations of cinematographers and film students. He made a difference."
American Psycho novelist and screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis paid tribute on Twitter saying Zsigmond was "one of the greatest cinematographers in movie history and defined the look of 70s film".
Easy Rider actor Peter Fonda also tweeted: "Such a dear man and great friend."
Zsigmond was one of the most in-demand cinematographers in Hollywood, working with directors such as Michael Cimino, Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma and George Miller.
Spielberg was particularly impressed with Zsigmond's work and chose him for his debut feature The Sugarland Express, which then inspired the director to hire him again for his global hit Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
Zsigmond's Oscar nomination for the traumatic Vietnam War film The Deer Hunter came in 1979 and the cinematographer considered the film one of his finest achievements.
During the 1980s, the film-maker worked on smaller movies and received another Oscar nomination for Mark Rydell's The River in 1984.
Zsigmond also worked on a series of Woody Allen films in the 2000s, including Melinda and Melinda, Cassandra's Dream and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.

article A North Korean referred to only as "Kim" was paid to carry out an attack with biochemical substances, the ministry of state security said.
The plot was foiled, it said, but gave no details on the fate of "Kim". The CIA declined to comment and South Korea has issued no statement so far.
The North's claim comes amid continued high tension on the Korean peninsula.
US President Donald Trump has promised to "solve" North Korea and stop it developing nuclear weapons.
Full text of North's allegation
The statement should be treated with scepticism. The regime has a track record of false information. It would be surprising if American or South Korean intelligence agencies didn't try to have agents in North Korea but the specific allegations about an assassination plot raise many questions.
Why hasn't a suspect been produced? Why does the KCNA statement cite poisoning at one moment and a bombing the next? How would anyone get access to Kim Jong-un, a man perpetually surrounded by squads of protectors and whose movements are secret?
Journalists who go to Pyongyang have cell-phones taken off them whenever they go to events where he might be, presumably to prevent tracking - so how would an ordinary citizen get more access?
Plots to kill Kim Jong-un may have been hatched but a bald statement by the media controlled by a vicious regime does not add up to convincing evidence.
The ministry of state security statement, carried by state news agency KCNA, said the CIA and South Korean intelligence services had "hatched a vicious plot to hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK".
It did not mention Kim Jong-un by name, but he is widely referred to as the supreme leader.
The ministry said a plot had been hatched to use "bomb terrorism" to target the supreme leadership at a military parade or at an event at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung, the country's founding leader.
It said "Kim" had been told that the best method was the use of "biochemical substances including radioactive substance and nano poisonous substance" whose results would "appear after six or 12 months".
June 2014: A North Korean working at a timber firm in the Khabarovsk territory of far-eastern Russia is "corrupted and bribed" by CIA and South Korean intelligence agents. The man - "Kim" - is given cash and a "satellite transmitter-receiver" and returns to Pyongyang
January, May, August, September 2016: "Kim" is in satellite contact with South Korean agents on handling biochemical agents and on the possible sites of an assassination attempt
March and April 2017: "Kim" meets a South Korean agent in the city of Dandong in China and is given a new transmitter and more cash. Further communications take place in April. The last date that appears in the North Korean statement is "early May", when "Kim" is supposed to receive "necessary equipment" via a "liaison centre" he has set up with his funding. No details are given on "Kim's" apprehension or fate

"Only the CIA can produce such substance", it said, adding that South Korea had borne the funding.
The ministry alleged that the North Korean man had been "turned" by the CIA and the South Korean intelligence service while working in Russia in 2014.
The ministry refers to two payments to "Kim" of $20,000 (Â£15,500) and a further two of $100,000 for "bribery" and obtaining equipment. It refers to another of $50,000 but it is unclear if this is additional.
On his return to Pyongyang, it says, he was instructed to provide detailed information about a frequently used event ground and to assess possible methods of attack.

Trump: I would meet Kim Jong-un
North Korea crisis: Your questions answered
The ministry statement gave no details of how the alleged plan had been uncovered or about the fate of "Kim", whom it described as "human scum".
The ministry said the "intelligence and plot-breeding organisations of the US imperialists and the puppet clique", referring to the South, would be swept away.
Earlier this year, Kim Jong-un's half brother, Kim Jong-nam, was killed with the banned nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur international airport. South Korea and Malaysia say it was an assassination carried out by the North.
A war of words between the West and nuclear-armed North Korea has escalated in recent weeks, with Pyongyang threatening to carry out a sixth nuclear test.
On Saturday, North Korea conducted its second failed ballistic missile test in two weeks.
The US has sent a warship to the region and installed a controversial anti-missile defence system in South Korea.
President Trump has warned of "major, major conflict" with North Korea.
But he also said this week he would be willing to meet Kim Jong-un, in the right circumstances. The White House quickly clarified that conditions were "clearly not there right now" and said the North should "end its provocative behaviour immediately".

article The matches will take place at the Belfast venue on 10, 12, 14, 17 and 19 July, with Ireland coach John Bracewell expecting "fiercely competitive" games.
Ireland are also scheduled to host one-day fixtures against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer.
Away one-day internationals against Australia and South Africa have been confirmed for September.
"We're certainly getting close to the amount and variety of fixtures we need to continue our international development," said head coach Bracewell.
"The more games we play in varying conditions the more we learn and grow as a cricketing nation. I expect the five-game series against Afghanistan will be tough and fiercely competitive.
"They had an excellent series win in both ODI's and Twenty20 against Zimbabwe last year, and continued that form in the World Twenty20 beating the eventual champions West Indies, which was a fantastic achievement for them and the Associate cricket cause.
"It'll be a new experience for the players to be involved in a five-game series but one which I'm certain they'll relish and thrive on."
The teams have played four one-day internationals to date, with Ireland winning three and Afghanistan one.
Their only one-day international meeting on Irish soil came in the World Cricket League Championship in 2012 which saw Ireland win by 59 runs thanks to a half century from Ed Joyce.

article The troubled German carmaker said efficiency and technology would be the company's watchwords as it "repositioned itself for the future".
It added that all new diesel cars would be fitted with the "best environmental technology".
There will also be greater focus on hybrid and electric vehicles.
"We are becoming more efficient, we are giving our product range and our core technologies a new focus, and we are creating room for forward-looking technologies by speeding up the efficiency programme," said VW's Dr Herbert Diess.
The carmaker said it would now be fitting the kinds of clean diesel technologies needed to meet stricter US standards across all its cars in both the US and Europe.
It also revealed that its flagship Phaeton model would in the future be purely electric, capable of driving long distances on a single charge.
Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent
It's no surprise VW is cutting investment. It is facing potentially huge fines, class action lawsuits and possible criminal penalties, in the US and quite possibly other countries as well. The €6.5bn it has set aside to cover the costs of the emissions scandal is unlikely to be anywhere near enough.
The company now says it will only use "the best environmental technology" in its diesel cars. In practice, this means abandoning so-called 'lean NOx traps' in favour of more complex and more expensive urea injection technology. A cynic might say it should have done that much sooner.
So now VW will focus on developing electric cars and plug-in hybrids, using standard parts and processes that can be rolled out across different types of vehicles and different brands.
It's fair to say the industry as a whole is moving in this direction anyway. Even so, Volkswagen's change of course does look rather like a scandal-induced handbrake turn.
VW has already appointed a new chief executive and chairman after the revelations last month that its cars cheated emissions tests in the US.
The company has launched a thorough investigation into the scandal, but new chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch warned last week that answers would take "some time".
VW has set aside €6.5bn ($7.4bn; £4.8bn) to cover the costs of the scandal, but some experts believe the final bill could be much higher.
Shares in the company recovered slightly last week but are still down about 20% since the scandal broke in the middle of September.
summary Volkswagen has announced plans to make all new cars diesel-powered by 2020.

article One former prison officer, who served in the profession for 20 years, left for a lower paid job after he had "finally had enough" of working for a service "in decline for the last five years".
The man, who asked not to be named, said staff increasingly had to deal with the effects of Spice - a form of synthetic cannabis - "flooding" into prisons.
These included "extreme violence", he said, adding: "I have been attacked by a prisoner with an improvised knife on more than one occasion."
How dangerous are our prisons?
Court orders halt to prison protests
The man said his family had even be threatened with rape and murder after he disrupted "prisoners' dealings", and he is now under police protection after his own life was threatened.
"All of these things were part of the job, and I expected them. I didn't work in a normal 9-5 job.
"What I did expect is a fair wage that reflected the job I did, staff numbers to be safe.
"New staff are paid a terrible wage and that is why they have not been able to replace the staff that are leaving the service on a daily basis."
A female prison officer told the BBC staffing on the category B prison in south west England where she works was so low that on Saturdays and Sundays prisoners were only let out for meal times - two hours a day.
The officer, who has been in the service for 22 years, said too many experienced staff had been replaced with younger staff, who were less well paid and supported.
"I've seen new staff who have gone home in tears because they have to come back the next day," she said.
The woman, who is in her mid-40s, said she used to look forward to going to work and helping rehabilitate prisoners, but is now fearful.
"When I wake up each morning I have heart palpitations because I'm thinking 'what's going to happen today?'
"I never know what part of the prison I'll be working in or what type of prisoner I'm going to be dealing with."
A mother of two prison officers, who is also married to an-ex officer, said there was "no duty of care" and the service was in a "terrible state".
She said she was "frightened every day" for her two sons.
"They are employing children to run these prisons and ushering out - or pushing out the back door - the people who can cope with it," said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.
She said her son was recently involved in "four or five fights" at the prison he works in before lunchtime.
Prison officers are looking "for safety, not money" in their jobs, she added, but the profession was being negatively affected by violence, long hours and staff shortages.
"It just desperately needs sorting, desperately needs the support and to do something now before it all blows up for officers and prisoners."
Justice Secretary Liz Truss said prison officers did a "tough and difficult job", but the Prison Officers Association had failed to respond to government proposals to tackle their concerns.
Earlier this month, she unveiled a White Paper detailing Â£1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, and plans for 2,100 extra officers, drug tests and more autonomy for governors.

article Mr Trump made a great many promises in his run for the presidency - some concrete, some vague and some contradictory. Part of the magic of his appeal was that his various supporters seemed to focus on the ideas with which they agreed and ignore the ones that they didn't like.
The test now will be for the newly minted president to keep his coalition together as he tries to follow through on what he identifies as his top policy priorities. Can he forge a consensus between the anti-establishment masses that fuelled his campaign with the Washington powers that populate Congress and are necessary to successful implement his agenda?
Mr Trump ended his campaign rallies with the song You Can't Always Get What You Want by the Rolling Stones. It always seemed a peculiar choice, but perhaps it will be a source of comfort for him as he contemplates the early goals of his presidency. Here's a look at what he wants - and the likelihood that, if he tries, sometimes, he just might find he gets what he needs.
Trump's promises: Before and after
Meet President Trump's possible cabinet
The "impenetrable, physical , tall, powerful, beautiful" wall along the US-Mexico border was a central part of Mr Trump's campaign, from the moment he stepped off his golden escalator and into American hearts (or, at least, the hearts of a plurality of voters in enough states for an Electoral College majority).
The wall itself was enshrined in the Republican Party platform, which promised that it would cover the "entirety of the southern border" and be "sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic".
The price tag on such a massive construction project has been estimated at more than $20bn (Â£16bn), however, and despite Mr Trump's insistence, the Mexican government appears uninterested in paying for it. So, whither the wall?
Trump's promises: Before and after
Over the course of the past few months, some of Mr Trump's advisers have hinted that the wall may not be quite the imposing edifice his legion of supporters likely envisioned. Just recently, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said promising that Mexico would pay for said barrier was a "great campaign device". Campaign devices don't pay for concrete and rebar.
Then, in his first interview as president-elect, Mr Trump acknowledged that part of that wall may be a big, beautiful fence. Such is the reality of trying to build things along a 2,000-plus mile border that includes mountains and desert.
Outlook: The wall was a very tangible promise Mr Trump made and stuck by, even when he was subjected to criticism and ridicule for it. He'll have to make sure he has something to show for his efforts, if only to give himself a nice backdrop to stand against for the inevitable photo-op. Chances of a monumental Great Wall of Trump ever becoming a reality, however, seem slim.
For more than six years the Affordable Care Act has been the great white whale for Republicans, and now they finally have it lined up in their harpoon sights. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway - who will almost certainly have a position in the new administration - has even floated the idea of Congress voting to repeal the law just hours after Mr Trump is inaugurated.
Senate Democrats will try to construct procedural roadblocks to slow Republicans down, but Mr Trump has unilateral steps he could take as president and enough votes in Congress to make the current system painfully unworkable. That would likely leave tens of millions of Americans without health insurance, however, which is why Mr Trump has said that he may be more interested in reforming the law than straight-up killing it.
Why is Obamacare so controversial?
The challenge is that provisions Mr Trump has said he supports - such as the requirement that insurance policies must cover pre-existing medical conditions - are made possible by unpopular provisions like the mandate that all Americans purchase policies.
In the past, Republicans have talked about tearing up Obamacare "root and branch" and left it at that. They'll need more than catchy rhetoric if they want to avoid some painful fallout from their actions, however.
Outlook: Obamacare is on life support, but Republicans likely lack the political will to fully pull the plug. They may ease some of the government-ordered standards for insurance coverage, quietly remove the provision covering women's contraceptive services and make it much easier for individuals and companies to obtain religious exemptions. With full control of the government, however, they are going to be responsible for whatever mess they create going forward, which means in the end "reform" looks considerably more attractive than "repeal".
In his election-night victory speech, the first - virtually only - campaign promise Mr Trump mentioned was his pledge to ramp up investment in US infrastructure projects.
"We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals," he said. "We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none."
It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the man who made his name in the construction business is focused on construction, to the tune of $1 trillion in new spending over 10 years, according to earlier proposals. Some Republicans will certainly balk at the associated costs - one congressman is already warning of the resulting "debt bomb" - but Mr Trump has found allies among the Democrats in Congress.
Democrats may be less enthusiastic if it turns out much of these new construction projects are publicly financed but privately selected and managed, as one Trump adviser has proposed.
Outlook: Infrastructure spending gives Trump an early opportunity to tout bipartisan co-operation while having a tangible end result he can take credit for. Republicans may drag their heels, but they'll be hard-pressed to deny him from putting an early campaign promise in the "kept" column.
At various times during his campaign, Mr Trump promised to deport all 11 million undocumented workers living on US soil. "They will go out," he said.
He's since walked back such sweeping pronouncements, emphasising that removals will be focused on those with criminal records, such as drug-dealers, murderers and gang members. In a recent interview he said that number would total between 2 million and 3 million individuals - which is significantly more than the roughly 180,000 undocumented migrants with criminal convictions the US government currently says remain on American soil.
To get to that higher number, Mr Trump would likely have to vastly expand the definition of "criminal alien" or include all non-citizens with criminal records, regardless of their immigration status.
No matter how he slices it, removing such a large number of people would be a task well beyond the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's ability, which with current staffing and funding levels can process about 400,000 undocumented immigrants a year.
Outlook: Mass deportations - numbering in the millions - seems to be one of the campaign promises Mr Trump is determined to stand by. In the face of reluctance from Congress and financial obstacles, however, it will be tough for him to make the numbers add up.
If there's one topic that has been near and dear to the hearts of traditional Republicans, it's cutting taxes. One of Mr Trump's more conventional conservative campaign promises was his proposal to reduce rates for individuals and corporations across the board.
He will find a Republican-dominated Congress more than willing to help him accomplish that. Democrats during the Obama administration succeeded in rolling back many of the tax cuts pushed by Republican President George W Bush, including the estate, personal and capital gains tax breaks. Look for them to be restored.
Five questions on economy for Trump
Democrats in the Senate will likely fight these proposals, calling them a gift to the wealthy, but they won't have the votes by themselves, as the chamber's rules only require a simple majority to enact budget changes.
An interesting question for the Trump administration will be how aggressively it pushes the childcare tax credit Mr Trump unveiled in September. Some measures, such as guaranteed six-week paid maternity leave and efforts to compel employers to provide childcare, run counter to conservative orthodoxy.
Outlook: If Republicans control the levers of power, chances are very good a tax cut is coming. What it looks like, and who benefits the most, is still an open question. If Mr Trump's efforts veer too much toward helping the wealthy, he risks alienating the working-class voters who delivered the presidency to him.
Mr Trump has promised sweeping deregulation of business and industry, which he claims is hindering US economic growth.
He wants to repeal Obama-era financial reforms, including a soon-to-be-enforced requirement that financial advisers have a fiduciary duty to act in their client's best interests. Some of this will require congressional action, while others he can implement through the discretion afforded executive agencies.
He also has proposed curtailing environmental rules such as limits on greenhouse gas emissions from US coal plants. He plans to ignore the agreed-upon targets imposed by international climate treaties and streamline the process for obtaining government approval for oil and gas drilling.
Senate Democrats will try to block legislative deregulation - and, as long as the filibuster rule requiring a 60-vote majority to act is kept in place, they will have some power. Meanwhile, environmental groups are sure to try to prevent executive action with a flurry of lawsuits.
Outlook: The Obama administration showed that even without control of Congress, the presidency afforded considerable power to shape public policy. Now, with Congress at his side, Mr Trump will have a free hand to roll back much of what his predecessor enacted.
One of the top prizes of the 2016 presidential race was the chance to make a new lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, thanks to the Senate Republican leadership's decision to delay consideration of Mr Obama's nominee following the death of Antonin Scalia in January.
During the campaign, Mr Trump published a list of conservative judges, legal scholars and politicians from which he would choose the next justice - a move that helped shore up his support among the evangelical right, which recoiled at the prospect of a liberal majority on the high court.
Mr Trump will likely announce his selection shortly after he is inaugurated - if not beforehand - and the Senate is sure to move quickly to hold confirmation hearings and a vote.
Senate Democrats may decide to filibuster the nomination, which would force Republicans to marshal 60 votes to seat the new justice. There's the possibility that they could do away with the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, however, as Senate Democrats did for lower-court appointments.
Outlook: Assuming Mr Trump doesn't pick a wildcard who lacks conservative bona fides, the Republican Senate should give his nominee smooth sailing to the court. Democrats will fight, but they may try to keep the filibuster intact in case Mr Trump gets the opportunity to replace a liberal judge later in his presidency.
There was a moment, not too long ago, when it looked like criminal justice reform would be an issue on which libertarian-minded Republicans and civil rights Democrats could forge a bipartisan consensus.
Mandatory minimum sentences were viewed as too restrictive, often resulting in disproportionate punishment for poor and minorities. Police tactics were deemed too harsh.
Then Mr Trump swept to the Republican nomination and, subsequently, the presidency while citing questionable statistics about runaway urban crime and calling for an increase in police powers and more stringent sentencing. He questioned the appropriateness of government-provided lawyers for indigent defendants and suggested prison life for convicts was too luxurious.
The new president will be able to unilaterally undo Mr Obama's efforts to grant clemency to some federal inmates, restore police access to government military-grade equipment and suspend Justice Department efforts to collect data on instances of police shootings.
Outlook: Mr Trump will have broad power to affect federal policies on crime-fighting, although as Vox's German Lopez points out, there is room for reform efforts to continue on the state and local level. Criminal justice legislation of any kind - even for measures Mr Trump supports - will likely be a very low priority in the next Congress.
summary Donald Trump's campaign promises were a bit like a sandbox.

article Police said all 21 are from eastern Europe and had come to Northern Ireland for work, but may have become victims of forced labour or exploitation.
Sixteen of them were rescued on Friday when officers searched premises in Newtownhamilton, County Armagh.
In a separate operation in Belfast, five potential victims were identified.
All 21 people are now in the care of police and other agencies.
It is quite an intense and sad piece of work to see human beings bought and sold as commodities.
It is quite challenging for everybody, for the staff involved as well.
Obviously, I can't talk about these specific cases, but in the past, we have supported trafficked women. They are very distressed and mistrustful following their experience in dealing with violence and abuse.
A lot of work has to be done in terms of supporting them and regaining their trust.
One woman left me a very sad note. It said: "I am so damaged, nobody will be able to help me."
She re-trafficked herself.
Marie Brown, Women's Aid
The Newtownhamilton operation focused on workers in the agricultural sector and those rescued are men and women aged between 18 and 45.
They are now being cared for by Migrant Help and Women's Aid.
Det Ch Insp Douglas Grant, from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch, said: "The first operation was an operation into human trafficking for suspected forced labour.
"On Friday, we conducted a number of searches in the Newtownhamilton area which resulted in PSNI officers identifying 16 potential victims of human trafficking who we believe were being exploited in the agricultural sector.
"The victims are eastern European nationals, we believe they came to Northern Ireland seeking work and were subsequently exploited."
The officer said some of those rescued were "very distressed" and translation difficulties had complicated the investigation.
"In terms of the number of potential victims, this is one of the largest operations we have mounted in the past year," the officer's statement said.
"Due to the numbers involved, and the challenges posed by language issues, it will take some time to form a clear picture of what exactly has taken place.
"But we are following a number of definite lines of inquiry and our investigation will continue for some time," he added.
The Belfast operation focused on organised crime, and those rescued are believed to have been exploited by criminal gangs, but forced labour is not suspected.
Both operations have been led by detectives from the PSNI Human Trafficking Unit, but they are being assisted by HM Revenue and Customs, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and the Health and Safety Executive.
The people who have been rescued will be assessed for referral to the UK Human Trafficking Centre, which is run by the National Crime Agency (NCA).
Det Ch Insp Grant said the PSNI investigation would try to "establish how these people came to Northern Ireland and the arrangements under which they were working".
"Any evidence of illegal activity will be brought before the courts," he added.
Dr Neil Jarman, Queen's University, who researches human trafficking, said the number recovered in the two operations was large.
"These two operations have got 50% of the total number of victims recovered in previous years," he said.
"It is very difficult to have a clear idea of the number of people that might be held in modern day slavery. But the numbers are going up."
He said that, in the past, it had proved challenging to secure prosecutions, partly because of the nature of the crimes and partly because of the fear and potential threat felt by victims.
He said new legislation had been introduced on forced labour in the UK that should have an effect.
Dr Jarman said it was important that various agencies worked together and cooperated on human trafficking.

article Officials at the Torkham point said 2,900 people crossed into Afghanistan and 550 entered Pakistan on Tuesday.
Figures from the other main crossing at Chaman were not immediately available.
Pakistan shut the crossings nearly three weeks ago after a wave of deadly attacks by militants it said were operating from Afghan soil.
The two countries have long accused each other of doing too little to tackle militants.
Afghanistan says some 25,000 Afghans are stranded in Pakistan because of the border closure.
The two crossings will be open for a second day but many believe it is unlikely all the people still stranded will be able to cross the border on Wednesday.
"We are trapped here because we have problems in our homeland," one man, Shah Wali, who is from the Afghan city of Kunduz, told BBC Urdu's Azizullah Khan.
Zabihullah said he had travelled to Pakistan for medical treatment.

article Ilija High attacked two of the women on a secluded footpath in Spondon, Derby, and the other near a nature reserve in the city's Darley Abbey.
He was caught following a high-profile appeal, which saw thousands of leaflets handed out. One of the attacks was also featured on the BBC's Crimewatch.
The 23-year-old from Chaddesden was told to expect a significant jail term.
At Derby Crown Court, High admitted three counts of rape, three attempted rapes and assault by penetration.
More on this and other stories from across the East Midlands
In the first attack, on 27 September 2014, he tried to rape a teenage girl on a footpath between West Park Road and Acorn Way in Spondon.
A year later, on 7 September, he raped a woman three times and tried to rape her a fourth time in Darley Abbey.
And on 22 December that year, he returned to the same area of Spondon, where he tried to rape another woman.
After High admitted the charges, Judge Robert Egbuna called for a psychiatric report and warned him to expect a "significant" sentence.
He was remanded in custody to appear at Derby Crown Court in June.

article Default rates rose on this unsecured debt in the final three months of the year, the Bank of England's Credit Conditions Survey shows.
Write-offs had been at historically low levels, but demand and the availability of credit have risen.
The Bank's governor has already urged vigilance over the issue.
The total level of unsecured debt has been rising at its fastest pace for 11 years.
"We are going to remain vigilant around the issue, because we have seen this shift," Bank of England governor Mark Carney said in November.
The TUC and debt charities have warned that if there was a squeeze on employment and spending power in 2017, an increasing number of people could find their debts unmanageable.
Following the Bank's latest figures, Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The Bank of England may well be perturbed to see that there was a loosening of credit standards for unsecured lending other than credit cards.
"It looks inevitable that the fundamentals for consumers will progressively weaken over the coming months."
However, analysts at Capital Economics said that consumer debt on the whole was not out of control.
"While other forms of borrowing such as mortgage borrowing have been rising too, they have done so considerably more slowly.
"Accordingly, total household borrowing has risen by only 4% over the last year, hardly a borrowing binge and well down on the growth rates of 10% plus seen before the financial crisis."
Capital Economics added that the cost of servicing debts compared to household income was still low and manageable. Interest rates would have to rise significantly to raise this cost to the levels seen in 2008, it said.
The Bank of England's chief economist has also said there is no need to panic.
"Interest rates are still very low, and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, so there are fewer concerns on debt servicing than there were in the past," Andy Haldane said recently.
"There are reasons not to be too alarmed about it ticking up, but it is absolutely something we will watch carefully," he added.

article While legislative efforts take time, a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice.
President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege.
Given his predecessor's reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency, he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle.
What are executive orders?
Here's a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far:
A bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste.
Senator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an "attack on coal miners".
The US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests.
The executive order elevates controversial adviser Stephen Bannon to the National Security Council (NSC), which is the main forum for discussion of issues of highest security and foreign policy.
Mr Bannon, the former editor of the Breitbart News Network, joins the NSC principals committee, effectively giving him a security role normally held by military generals.
At the same time, the order also shifts the role of the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (the highest ranking military officer in the US), who will now only attend meetings "where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed".
White House officials strongly denied that this meant a demotion for the top US general.
Previous presidents had kept separate their political and national security advisers for fear of being seen to be playing politics with the country's security.
President George W Bush's chief of staff, Josh Bolten, barred his top adviser Karl Rove from ever attending the meetings, saying the NSC decisions "involve life and death for the people in uniform" and should "not be tainted by any political decisions".
Immediate impact: The announcement elicited shock from both parties, with influential Senator John McCain calling Mr Bannon's appointment "a radical departure from any National Security Council in history".
Despite outrage from Democrats - President Obama's last National Security Adviser Susan Rice called it "stone cold crazy" - Mr Trump is unlikely to reverse the decision, as Mr Bannon has been one of his most trusted advisers since the early days of his campaign.
Steve Bannon: Who is Trump's key adviser?
An attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses.
Described as a "two-out, one-in" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney.
Some categories of regulation will be exempt from the "two-out, one-in" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and "any other category of regulations exempted by the Director".
Immediate impact: Wait and see.
Trump moves to cut business regulation
Probably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said.
It included:
The effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US.
Immediate impact: Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure.
Trump border policy: Who's affected?
On Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority.
He pledged repeatedly at rallies to "build the wall" along the southern border, saying it would be "big, beautiful, and powerful".
Now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise.
One order declares that the US will create "a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier".
The second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called "sanctuary cities" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants.
It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.
Steps before building can start
Immediate impact: The Department of Homeland Security has a "small" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans.
The department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed.
How exactly will Trump 'build the wall'?
On his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access.
Mr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement.
Keystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change.
The second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site.
Steps before it can happen
Immediate impact: TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, has resubmitted their permit proposal, but the project will likely attract legal battles on the state level. The Army Corps of Engineers will continue its review of the Dakota Access pipeline route, but the executive order could speed up the process - and set the stage for a final route approval by a political appointee.
Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed?
Dakota Pipeline: What's behind the controversy?
In one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system.
The order states that agencies must "waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers.
Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible.
Steps before it can happen
Immediate impact: Not much, unless it's interpreted very broadly by the new Health Secretary and individual states. But it's probably more likely to influence how Congress proceeds with its repeal efforts.
Can Obamacare be repealed?
What's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from "providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country", even if they do so with other funding.
The ban, derided as a "global gag rule" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back.
Anti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them.
Immediate impact: The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants. It will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place - the Guttmacher Institute, Kaiser Family Foundation and Population Action International believe the order, as written, will apply to all global health funding by the US, instead of only reproductive health or family planning.
Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean?
On Mr Trump's first full workday in the White House he issued a directive to federal agencies to halt any new government hiring.
He told reporters who had gathered for the signing that the freeze would not affect military spending.
The directive is part of Mr Trump's effort to reduce government debts and decrease the size of the federal workforce.
During his campaign, he frequently railed against government bureaucracy, and vowed to "drain the swamp" of corrupt governance.
Immediate impact: A hiring freeze is immediate, and is expected to last 90 days. The order allows exceptions under broad categories, including military, public safety, as well as case by case exceptions by the Office of Management and Budget.
Has the federal workforce really 'dramatically increased'?
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obama's international trade policy, was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail (although he at times seemed uncertain about what nations were actually involved).
The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US.
Therefore the formal "withdrawal" is more akin to a decision on the part of the US to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die.
Immediate impact: Takes effect immediately. In the meantime, some experts are worried China will seek to replace itself in the deal or add TPP nations to its own free trade negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), excluding the US.
TPP: What is it and why does it matter?

article With Shamrock Rovers losing 3-0 at Cork City, Derry are now three points ahead of the Hoops although the Dublin club have a game in hand.
Wexford's Eric Molloy hit the Derry woodwork early on and Gerard Doherty had to make a couple of fine saves.
Derry also had good chances but a draw was probably a fair result.
Second-from-bottom Wexford, already beaten three times by Derry this season, started brightly as Paul Murphy headed wide and Molloy hit the woodwork in the eighth minute with Doherty beaten.
As Derry improved, Wexford defender Gary Delaney made a brave intervention to divert a Lukas Schubert header out for a corner and home keeper Graham Doyle then produced a superb double save to deny the lively Nathan Boyle and Barry McNamee.
Doyle's evening was a mixed bag as he made a number of fine reaction saves but also struggled to deal with a few tame shots from range.
Rory Patterson had the ball in Wexford's net in the 28th but the effort was correctly ruled out for offside.
Wexford enjoyed a good period just before half-time as substitute Jonny Bonner - on for the injured Delaney - hit a swerving shot inches over Doherty's bar and Murphy tested the Derry keeper with a headed effort.
In the second period, Derry looked the more likely side to break the deadlock as Doyle denied Boyle and Schubert got the ball stuck in his feet when he seemed certain to score after Wexford had failed to clear a Patterson free-kick.
But defeat would have been harsh for the home outfit after a battling display.

article The prime minister said she and Home Secretary Amber Rudd still had confidence in the inquiry.
She spoke after the lead counsel to the hearings, Ben Emmerson, was suspended on Wednesday and the inquiry's second most senior lawyer resigned.
Elizabeth Prochaska's resignation is said to be not linked to recent events.
Ms Prochaska told BBC Newsnight's programme:  "I can confirm that after 15 months working on the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, I resigned from my position as junior counsel with effect from 15 September 2016.
"I very much valued the experience of working with the inquiry and I wish all my former colleagues the best as they continue their work."
Her resignation from her role as first junior counsel follows other problems faced by the inquiry, which was originally set up in 2014.
On Wednesday the inquiry said it had "recently become very concerned about aspects of Ben Emmerson QC's leadership" of his team and he had been suspended so these could be properly investigated.
The BBC understands more than one complaint has been made against him.
Preliminary hearings for the inquiry began in March at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.
But Prof Alexis Jay, the current chairwoman, is the fourth person to have been appointed to lead the inquiry, following three earlier resignations.
Prime Minister Theresa May said the "really important" hearings would go ahead as planned.
Speaking during a visit to Wiltshire, she said: "I set the inquiry up when I was home secretary and the current home secretary has made clear the original terms of reference were the right ones and I think that's important.
"We should always remember why it is that the inquiry was set up in the first place and when those terms of reference were set they were agreed with victims and survivors and it is victims and survivors who are at the heart of this inquiry."
In a statement, the inquiry thanked Ms Prochaska for her "commitment" and "the valuable contribution that she made to its work".
It also described the recent events as "unsettling, particularly for victims and survivors of child sexual abuse and all those who are engaged with the inquiry's work".
The inquiry added: "It has been said that the inquiry is in crisis. This is simply not the case, and the chair and panel are united in their determination to see this important work through to a conclusion."
The inquiry was set up to examine whether public bodies including the police have failed in their duty to protect children from sexual abuse. It will also examine claims of abuse involving "well-known people".

article Adele Bellis was left with permanent "life-changing" scarring, lost an ear and is partially bald after the attack in Lowestoft last August.
She had already suffered a knife attack in the street four months earlier in which she was stabbed in the mouth.
Her former partner, Anthony Riley, 26 is accused of organising both the attacks on Miss Bellis, then 22.
In a video interview played at Ipswich Crown Court, she said she was talking on the phone when a man walked past with his face covered and carrying a bottle.
He then spilled the bottle all over her, she said.
"After two or three seconds my skin just burned and I knew it was acid," she said.
"I remember I was smoking, I was just crying and shouting 'I'm burning, I'm burning'."
As her clothes dissolved, people tried to help her.
In the knife attack earlier on 29 April, Miss Bellis said Mr Riley led her down an alleyway where she saw a masked man, allegedly co-defendant Leon Thompson, 39.
"The man jumped on Anthony and he didn't really do much," she said.
"I turned around to see what was happening and this guy stabbed me."
Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said not content with the knife attack, Mr Riley had recruited another man to pour sulphuric acid over her.
It is alleged Riley forced Jason Harrison, who owed him money, to do it, and jurors were told Harrison has already admitted his part in the conspiracy.
Mr Riley, of Raglan Street, Lowestoft, denies false imprisonment, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mr Thompson, of Alma Road, Lowestoft, denies wounding with intent, having a knife in public, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.

article The 27-year-old was sick during a gym session last week and was taken ill again later in the evening.
"He's very worried because he thought it was an off day, and it might just be a virus that has hit him hard," Torquay manager Kevin Nicholson told BBC Sport.
"But with all that's gone on lately in football with things like heart problems we couldn't take any chances."
Verma joined Torquay on loan from Kidderminster in November and the deal has since been extended until the end of the season.
"He's feeling fine now but the doctors have told him to do pretty much nothing, so he's bored out of his mind as he just has to rest until he's given the all-clear," Nicholson said.
It is hoped Verma will get the result of his tests on Monday, but he will miss Torquay's game with Chester on Saturday, having also sat out Tuesday's FA Trophy draw with Macclesfield.
"He was in a gym session and he was sick," Nicholson said.
"The immediate reaction when that happens is the lads take the mick as he they thought he was broken in the gym, but it's not like him as he's a very fit lad.
"He started immediately with headaches and then in the evening he collapsed when he went to go to the toilet.
"He went to be looked at by the doctor the next morning and they couldn't get to the bottom of what it was after having all kinds of tests and since then he's been out of commission and he's had a few other tests."
In December 2014, winger Courtney Cameron was taken to hospital by a teammate after suffering acute headaches and dizziness, which was later diagnosed as a problem with his teeth.

article Panorama has obtained police emails sent shortly after Mr Watson's statement to the Commons in 2012.
They concluded that there was no evidence the minister was guilty of any criminal complicity.
Mr Watson has made no immediate comment on the emails' dismissal.
He has been criticised for allegations made during his campaign on behalf of victims of child abuse.
The statement concerning the current minister came during prime minister's questions in October 2012.
Mr Watson said a file of evidence seized in the early 1990s contained "clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring".
He added: "One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad.
"The leads were not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to ensure that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10."
The claim dates back to the 1970s, when the political aide was in his teens. However, he later entered politics and is now a government minister.
Following Mr Watson's statement, police obtained the files from Metropolitan Police archive and examined them for evidence of any offences.
In December 2012 the police emails seen by the BBC concluded there was "no evidence of offending linked to [the minister] held within the files".
They went on: "There is not any further material in the file to support the inference to any level of criminal complicity on behalf of [the minister]."
This conclusion has never been made public. The Metropolitan Police had said in a statement that it did not publish an announcement on every allegation it investigated, adding that it was "checking records to ascertain the circumstances of the allegation".
The files on which Mr Watson based his Commons statement were seized as part of an investigation into the paedophile ring and centred on senior social worker Peter Righton in the early 1990s.
Mr Watson was briefed on their content, before making his statement, by Peter McKelvie, a former child protection manager who has described himself as a "whistleblower".
Mr McKelvie has told the BBC he did not claim to Mr Watson that there had been a "Westminster paedophile ring".
He also pointed out that the police investigations which followed the Commons statement had led to convictions of two men who were part of the original paedophile ring.

article Dame Sally Davies has written to all GPs and pharmacies to ensure they are prescribing the correct drugs after the rise of "super-gonorrhoea" in Leeds.
Her warning comes after concerns were raised that some patients were not getting both of the antibiotics needed to clear the infection.
Sexual health doctors said gonorrhoea was "rapidly" developing resistance.
A highly drug-resistant strain of gonorrhoea was detected in the north of England in March.
That strain is able to shrug off the antibiotic azithromycin, which is normally used alongside another drug, ceftriaxone.
In her letter, the chief medical officer said: "Gonorrhoea is at risk of becoming an untreatable disease due to the continuing emergence of antimicrobial resistance."
But while an injection of ceftriaxone and an azithromycin pill are supposed to be used in combination, this may not always be the case for all patients.
Earlier this year, the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) warned that some online pharmacies were offering only oral medication.
Using just one of the two drugs makes it easier for the bacterium to develop resistance.
The letter, which is also signed by chief pharmaceutical officer Dr Keith Ridge, stated: "Gonorrhoea has rapidly acquired resistance to new antibiotics, leaving few alternatives to the current recommendations.
"It is therefore extremely important that suboptimal treatment does not occur."
The disease is caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.
Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. Often the person has no symptoms, however, but can still easily spread the disease to others.
Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.
Gonorrhoea is the second most common sexually transmitted infection in England and cases are soaring.
The number of infections increased by 19% from 29,419 in 2013 to 34,958 the following year.
Dr Jan Clarke, the president of BASHH, told the BBC News website: "We're really pleased that the chief medical officer has stressed that gonorrhoea needs this approach to treatment due to the rapid development of resistance.
"We need to protect what we've got and we need to encourage pharmacists and general practitioners to follow first-line treatment."
Dr Andrew Lee, from Public Health England, added: "Investigations are ongoing into a number of cases of anti-microbial resistant gonorrhoea.
"Public Health England will continue to monitor, and act on, the spread of antimicrobial resistance and potential gonorrhoea treatment failures, to make sure they are identified and managed promptly."

article The United boss has signed Harry Lewis on loan from Southampton and Deniz Mehmet from Port Vale and negotiations have taken place with Kilmarnock, with Bell keen to return to Rugby Park.
"There is no situation," McKinnon told BBC Scotland ahead of a 2-0 League Cup win over Raith Rovers at Tannadice.
"Cammy has an injury and we wanted to make sure we had plenty of cover."
Paul McMullen and James Keatings scored their first United goals in the Group C tie.
McMullan broke the deadlock when he curled a shot high into the corner to beat Raith goalkeeper Aaron Lennox.
Keatings' scored from the penalty spot in the second half to make the points safe for the home side.
However, it is Cowdenbeath who occupy top spot in the group, on goals scored, after they won 4-2 against Highland League champions Buckie Thistle.
United's best effort in the first half came in the opening minute when McMullan hit a low shot with the right foot after cutting in from the left to test Lennox, who fumbled but held the ball at the second attempt.
Raith should have gone ahead when Mehmet mishit a clearance straight at Greig Spence who squared to Liam Buchanan, but his 20-yard effort towards an open goal was headed off the line by Mark Durnan.
Keatings' shot after the restart brought a save from Lennox and the tempo of the game went up a notch, then a touch of class from McMullan from the left of the box saw him pick out the top corner for United's opener.
Keatings made it 2-0 from the spot when Ian Davidson bundled on-loan midfielder Sam Stanton off the ball to concede a penalty.
Billy King fired a low shot which Raith keeper Lennox saved at full stretch, then Buchanan missed a chance to pull one back for Raith from 14 yards.
At Central Park, Craig Dorrat gave Buckie Thistle the lead but David Syme scored the first of two goals to equalise.
Cameron Muirhead rounded the goalkeeper to put the home side ahead, and though Drew Copeland levelled Syme's second restored the lead.
Ryan Connelly's fantastic solo goal rounded off the win for Billy Brown's side.

article Many people will be there to support him on Friday as he "takes the oath" and makes his inaugural speech - two traditions that happen on the day that a new president starts the job.
Members of the public will stand along the National Mall to watch him being made their new leader and there will also be VIP guests.
One group of people supporting the new president will be his close family.
But who are they? Newsround takes a look:
Melania Trump is Donald Trump's wife.
She was born in born in Slovenia and married Donald Trump in January 2005.
They have one child together called Barron (more on him later!).
In November 2016, it was reported that she won't move into the White House with her husband straight away, as she will stay in New York - where the Trumps currently live - with their son, while he finishes school there.
Barron Trump is Donald Trumps 10-year-old son. His mum is Melania.
He enjoys playing golf with his dad and can apparently speak Slovenian, which is his mum's first language.
He will carry on living in New York with his mum rather than move to the White House straight away, so he can finish the school year.
Ivanka is another of Donald Trump's daughters and perhaps the most well-known of his children.
She was a judge on her dad's reality TV show The Apprentice.
She will move to Washington like her father when he officially starts the job as president, as her husband has been named as one of his chief advisors.
Tiffany Trump, who is 23, is another one of Donald Trump's daughters.
Like her father, she likes to use social media a lot and has just finished a degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
Eric Trump is one of Donald Trump's sons.
He is an executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, which is the business empire that Donald Trump built up.
At the age of 23, he launched a big charity organisation that helps children who have life-threatening conditions.
Donald Trump Jr is Donald Trump's eldest son with his first wife called Ivana, who was Czech, so he grew up speaking Czech.
Now 39 years old, he is also executive vice-president of The Trump Organization.
Donald Trump has handed over management of the Trump Organization to Donald Jr and Eric, as he is not allowed to do this job at the same time as being president.

article The Black Cats have agreed a £14m fee with Liverpool for striker Fabio Borini but Poyet says hopes the Italian will sign are fading.
Borini, 23, was injured in the Reds' 1-0 friendly defeat against AS Roma in Boston on Wednesday.
"We are desperate to do something," Poyet told the Sunderland Echo.
Borini spent last season on loan on Wearside and helped Sunderland avoid relegation, but Poyet is not confident of securing the Italian's return.
He said: "I think we need to be honest. The more time that goes past, it looks to me like we have less chance.
"Some people think the opposite - the more players Liverpool sign, then there is more chance. Let's see who is right and wrong."
Sunderland have failed to add to the captures of goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, defender Billy Jones and midfielder Jordi Gomez.
The squad leaves for a pre-season training camp in Portugal on Friday and Poyet admits he is frustrated.
He added: "I'm waiting and waiting, which is not nice. You're expecting to do a couple of deals, but they're not happening.
"People say 'don't be anxious or nervous'. I think there will be at least one in by Friday and I hope at the weekend we can have three in.
"But the word I'm saying is 'hope'. It's a matter of time, but as the days go past, that becomes difficult.
"We are waiting, we are desperate to do something in the next few days because we are going to Portugal and we need to have as many players as possible in place by the time we get there."
Borini's agent has suggested he is happy to fight for his place at Liverpool while Fiorentina are yet to sanction a switch for full-back Marcos Alonso, 23, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Sunderland who are reported to want to sign him permanently.

article The Warriors emerged from a testing clash with Zebre in Parma with a bonus-point win to move fourth in the Pro12.
Many frontline players missed the trip, leaving them fresh for Friday's match.
"The pleasing thing is we have played four away games in our first six Pro12 matches and we are a point off the top of the league," Townsend said.
"We probably haven't played our best in all those games so we know there is a lot more to come from this group."
The likes of Scotland lock Jonny Gray and wing Tommy Seymour - who had both played five games in a row - were rested this weekend, while half-backs Finn Russell and Henry Pyrgos are among others likely to return on Friday.
Townsend will alter Glasgow's normal preparations this week, taking his squad away to a hotel on Monday.
"We are going to spend some time looking at Leicester, a team the players don't know that well," he told BBC Sportsound.
"As coaches we have had a good look at them over the last week and this will be a real step up in terms of preparation.
"It is a new team we are facing, a higher level of rugby than we have faced week in, week out, and it will get us in a really good frame of mind and help with preparations over the next few days."
Glasgow have reached the Pro12 play-offs in each of Townsend's four previous seasons in charge, but they are yet to progress beyond the group stages of Europe's elite club competition.
They will renew acquaintances with Parisian giants Racing 92, who topped their pool last year, and Munster are familiar Pro12 foes, but they have not faced two-time European Cup winners Leicester for 16 years.
"It is a step up in competition - the best teams in England, France and the Pro12," Townsend noted.  "Leicester and Munster have both won the competition more than once, and Racing were French champions last year.
"We know it will be the best team Leicester can pick on Friday. It will be a higher level than we have had to deal with over the last few weeks but it should bring the best out of our players."

article Pembroke Wanderers' win over Ards did not help the Ulster side's chances.
With just two games remaining the gap between the bottom clubs is four points although Pembroke and the Elks do meet on the final weekend of the season.
At the top UCD maintained their one-point advantage over Monkstown with a comeback victory over Cork Harlequins.
Chloe Mitchell's goal was merely a consolation for the Elks as they were trounced by Monkstown and they face the daunting task of beating Loreto and then hoping that gives them the opportunity of catching Pembroke Wanderers.
Their cause wasn't helped when a Eanna Horan goal was enough for Pembroke to beat Ards 1-0, a result that ended any outside hopes the County Down side had of reaching the play-offs.
Indeed Pembroke have crept to within three points of Belfast Harlequins in the battle to avoid the relegation play-off.
Harlequins went ahead twice at Pegasus through goals from Amy Geddes and Gemma Frazer, only to be pegged back by two Ruth Maguire strikes but the 2-2 draw may yet end up being a vital point for the Belfast club.
UCD came from 3-1 down to third place Cork Harlequins to win 4-3 with Deifre Duke scoring twice and the other goals scored by Sorcha Clarke and Abbie Russell.
The victory kept them a point clear of Monkstown who have a game in hand but with the two sides, neither of which have lost this season, scheduled to meet on the final day, the destination of the women's IHL title is likely to go down to the wire.
With UCD, Monkstown and Cork certain to reach the play-offs the final place will go to the side that finishes fourth and Loreto moved a big step towards clinching it with a 3-2 win over their nearest challengers Railway Union.

article Gayle Newland, 27, of Willaston, Cheshire, created a "disturbingly complex" online persona to achieve her own "bizarre sexual satisfaction".
A retrial jury at Manchester Crown Court found her guilty of committing sexual assault by using a prosthetic penis without her victim's consent.
She will be sentenced on 20 July.
The complainant, who gave evidence behind a curtain, told the court she was persuaded by the defendant to wear a blindfold at all times when they met, and only found out she was having sex with Newland - rather than a man - when she finally took off her mask.
She said she thought she was having sex with Kye Fortune - a fake Facebook profile Newland created at the age of 15 using an American man's photographs and videos.
The complainant said Kye told her he was undergoing treatment for cancer and was paranoid about his physical appearance.
She told the court she agreed to his demands for her to wear a blindfold, consisting of a sleeping mask and a light scarf, because she was in love.
The complainant, also in her mid 20s, said: "There was no point until the day I took the blindfold off that I thought for one second that a woman was the person behind this."
Prosecutor Simon Medland QC asked her: "To who were you consenting?"
The complainant replied: "With Kye Fortune. The person I knew from the photos, the person I had spoken to, the person I shared all my dreams with, the person who I thought was half-Filipino half-Latino."
Newland, who graduated from the University of Chester with a degree in marketing and creative writing, told the court the pair met in a nightclub in 2011.
Newland claimed the complainant knew about the Kye Fortune persona and the pair began communicating in character.
The defendant told the court she never dressed as a man and no blindfold was ever used when they had intercourse on about 10 occasions at the complainant's flat in Chester.
Newland claimed her accuser always knew she was pretending to be Kye as they engaged in role play while struggling with their sexuality.
Mr Medland QC said: "This manipulative, deceitful and very crafty young woman went to such astonishing lengths to control the complainant's life and make her do the things the defendant wanted her to do."
Newland was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault and cleared of a fourth count. She was told by the judge she would have to sign the sex offenders register.
The Recorder of Manchester, Judge David Stockdale QC, granted Newland bail ahead of sentencing but told her the "overwhelming likelihood" was that she would receive "a significant immediate custodial sentence".
The verdicts can be reported after reporting restrictions imposed at the start of the retrial were lifted.
Newland was jailed for eight years in November 2015 after she was convicted of the same offences by another jury at Chester Crown Court.
The conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal in December and a retrial was ordered after it was ruled that the trial judge's summing up of the case was not fair and balanced.

Smoke bombs and other items were thrown before protestors were "swiftly ejected" from the building, he said.
There have been no injuries or arrests, he added.
A post on the website of a group called Calais Migrant Solidarity suggest it had organised the protest in "solidarity with the Calais migrants".
British Transport Police, which is jointly policing the protest with the Met, said its officers were facilitating a peaceful protest when "a number of other individuals arrived at the station causing disorder, and missiles, including smoke bombs were thrown at police officers".
"This group were dispersed by police," it said.

article The Islamist fighters have released images of captured soldiers being beheaded after the battle for the base.
The Syrian army did not confirm that the base had fallen, but said it was organising a counter-attack.
Isis already controls much of Raqqa province, and recently seized a swathe of territory in neighbouring Iraq.
The group, which has changed its name to Islamic State, describes the territory under its control in Iraq and Syria as a caliphate.
The Raqqa base, manned by Division 17 of the Syrian army, is said to have been captured overnight after coming under siege from Isis fighters.
According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors casualties in the conflict, the assault on the base began with two suicide car bomb attacks. Meanwhile, Syrian army helicopters attacked Isis positions around the base.
Scores of Isis fighters and government soldiers were killed or hurt in the attack, the group said. The base is the largest of its kind in north-eastern Syria, and is said to be well-stocked with weapons and ammunition.
Rivals to Isis within the Syrian opposition had pointed to the lack - until now - of major confrontation over the base, close to the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, as a sign of collaboration between government forces and the militants.
However, BBC Arabic correspondent Rami Ruhayem says this narrative has been falling apart in recent weeks as clashes between Isis and the Syrian army have intensified.
The militants recently captured a gas field in the central province of Homs, in an attack that killed more than 200 people.
At least 170,000 people have been killed, a third of them civilians, since the start of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.
Some nine million people, or a third of Syria's pre-war population, have fled their homes.

article The 34-year-old will retire from rugby at the end of the season having helped Sarries retain Europe's top prize.
"There have been huge transformations," said Hamilton, who played in two World Cups and won 63 Scotland caps.
"You can actually see a lot of what Saracens had six or seven years ago in the Scotland team now."
Expanding on the comparison, he told BBC Scotland: "The best players in the team have come through the system.
"You have a class number 10 in Finn Russell, a world-class 15 in Stuart Hogg.
"What we were lacking was a little bit of direction and strength in depth but everyone can see that Scotland are on the cusp of something. There have definitely been improvements.
"A lot of people were sceptical of Vern leaving and Gregor (Townsend) coming in but the backbone of that team is from Glasgow and Gregor has brought those guys through.
"He's going to be a fantastic coach and he's a great man as well, which is just as important."
Hamilton retired from the international scene in September 2015 after missing out on playing in a third World Cup, having experienced the tournament in France in 2007 and New Zealand four years later.
But he says "age has taken its toll" and, having won two European Champions Cup medals, he can finish his professional career "on a high".
"I'm not going to miss playing," he said. "It can be painful on the old joints and stuff, but I'll miss the camaraderie, the laughs and playing at big stadiums.
"Playing at Murrayfield at the weekend was absolutely amazing.
"Playing for Scotland was the best thing that ever happened to me in terms of my career, and my life, alongside my children.
"It gave me the platform to play rugby against the best teams in the world and travel the world.
"I also think that playing rugby has given me a foundation to be a better person. The life experiences you get, when losing, with injury, rugby is an incredible sport and Scotland is an amazing country - it has been an incredibly important part of my life."
Hamilton plans to take six months to a year away from the sport and to enjoy time with his wife, who is expecting twins, and their young family.
A future in coaching seems likely.
He said: "I'd love to get back into the game, it has given me so much and I'd love to give something back.
"Watch this space, I suppose."

Visitors to two open days will be able to view images showing the progress of the build and find out about works scheduled for this summer.
The first event is at Meadows Shopping Centre in Sandhurst, with the second on Thursday at Crowthorne Library.
The open days are being used as a way to keep residents up to date on new developments and how the project is progressing.
Currently three new ward buildings are under construction.
Vivienne Mowatt, Broadmoor Hospital's deputy programme director, said: "We're well into our first year of construction, so passers-by can actually see the buildings beginning to take shape.
"The hospital also plays an important role in the local community, so it's essential that we continue to let people know what's going on and remind them just how much this redevelopment is needed."
The new hospital will provide accommodation for 210 patients. Current patients will remain on site throughout the redevelopment.
The trust previously said many "core aspects" of the site, such as its Grade I listed gatehouse, would remain.

And Jos Buttler followed his century in the first match with an unbeaten 48 as England won with 22 balls left.
The St George's Park surface was not as conducive to shot-making as the Bloemfontein track on which England hit 15 sixes and amassed 399 in that first match on Wednesday.
They lost three wickets inside seven overs but Buttler was coolness personified, hitting three successive sixes in a devastating 28-ball cameo as England scored the final 29 runs in just eight balls to take a strong advantage into the third match in Centurion on Tuesday.
England lost Jason Roy in the third over and it prompted Joe Root and Hales to curb their natural attacking instincts.
Their calm second-wicket partnership of 97 in just under 23 overs contained only six boundaries but kept England in touch at 111-1 after 25 overs compared to South Africa's 114-3 at the same stage.
When Root played on to his stumps for 38 in the 26th over, England skipper Eoin Morgan brought himself in at number four, deciding his busy style of play against the spinners would be better suited to the slow, low pitch than Buttler's daring brand of strokeplay.
With 94 needed from as many deliveries, Morgan hoisted Morne Morkel towards long-on and De Villiers took a perfectly judged catch.
Ben Stokes also came in ahead of Buttler and successfully overturned an lbw dismissal third ball from Imran Tahir as replays showed the ball pitched outside leg-stump, the third unfortunate decision from South African official Johan Cloete.
But the left-hander had still to score when he got an inside edge on to his stumps off Morkel in the next over.
The stage was set for Buttler, at number six instead of number four as he was in the first match, with 87 needed from 80 balls.
Man-of-the-match Hales, who made only 136 runs in eight innings in the Test series, looked certain to record his second ODI century but his composed 124-ball innings ended in the 42nd over when the ball brushed his bat in his follow-through and glanced to the wicketkeeper.
However Buttler, who earlier in the day was bought for what now seems a bargain £385,000 by Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction, bided his time before hitting three successive boundaries off paceman Kyle Abbott.
Demonstrating more clinical hitting, he then dispatched spinner Tahir into the leg-side and down the ground for three massive maximums to take England within eight of a victory that Moeen Ali ensured with successive fours off Morkel.
Although the South Africans were not exactly plundering the runs, De Villiers had just hit his first six with an imperious front-foot pull off Chris Jordan and was building for a final charge inside the last 10 overs with his team 205-3.
When he launched Stokes deep into the leg-side he must have been hopeful that the swirling breeze and the bright sunshine might have made things difficult for the fielders.
But Jordan gave another example of his outstanding catching ability, running back to clutch the ball over his shoulder, his 18th catch in 26 ODIs.
JP Duminy departed three balls later lbw but although replays would show the ball was missing the stumps, he could not ask for a review because that had been spurned by Quinton de Kock, who also wasted the South Africa fielding review when he persuaded De Villiers to check a caught behind appeal against Hales that showed not a trace of contact with the bat.
Only four more boundaries followed in the remainder of the innings, unlike the six fours and five sixes England added from the final 10 at Bloemfontein in the opening match.
Jordan may have gone for 33 in his six overs with the ball but his superb catch saved a potentially decisive number of runs.
What they said
England captain Morgan: "The challenge today was adapting to the different conditions and that's what pleased me the most.
"We've not played on a surface like this for a long time, so it was top-class."
South Africa skipper De Villiers: "I felt we were about 20 short, 290-300 would have been ideal.
"Credit to the opposition, they out-thought us at times. Jos Buttler played an exceptional knock but they managed the innings really well early on with Alex Hales and Joe Root, and they set it up for a guy like Jos to finish it.
"Hopefully we'll get it to 2-2 on the Highveld and get it back to Cape Town for a decider."
Vic Marks: "Buttler is a remarkable cricketer, it's not just his power - it's the way he responds to these tight situations, finishing games as if it's a walk in the park."
Geoffrey Boycott: "Until the last 15 minutes, you'd have thought it could go either way.
"That catch from Chris Jordan was everything. I wouldn't have caught that in 10 attempts but I always thought Jordan would catch it - that was the turning point."

article The alleged offences, dating from 1967 to 1985, are related to 22 boys aged nine to 16.
Mr Denning was one of the original Radio 1 team when the station was launched in 1967.
He was initially arrested under Operation Yewtree in June 2013 and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.
Mr Denning, who is in his early 70s, was also the first announcer heard on BBC 2 when the television channel took to the air in 1964.
He worked as a music producer for The Beatles and helped launch the Bay City Rollers. He also ran his own music and video production business.
Baljit Ubhey, London chief Crown Prosecutor, said: "The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance on rape and child sexual abuse.
"We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest."
Prosecutors found that there was not enough evidence to prosecute in connection with three further alleged victims.
Mr Denning is the fifth person to be prosecuted as part of Operation Yewtree.

article The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs was previously "very concerned" about this individual.
They said they are continuing to try and contact a number of people but had "no reason to believe that any of these have been caught up in the incident."
The Irish embassy is in ongoing contact with the French authorities.
The attack coincided with Bastille Day, a national holiday in France, and thousands of people had gathered on the streets to watch a fireworks display.
Live updates: Bastille Day attack in Nice
A Northern Ireland man who witnessed the attack has described the "panic" at the scene.
Paddy Mullan, from Londonderry, is in Nice on holiday with his girlfriend.
He was standing on the city's Promenade des Anglais when he saw the truck approaching.
"This lorry just mounted the kerb, across the street from us and the next thing, all you could hear was banging and shouting and screaming," he said.
Belfast man Suneil Sharma, who was nearby when the truck hit the crowds, described the aftermath as "absolute pandemonium".
Meanwhile, the Irish ambassador to France, Geraldine Byrne-Nason, told the BBC she was not in a position to confirm details about individual cases.
She said the embassy was working on a number of "cases of concern" but there was no confirmation from the French authorities about the nationality or identity of the victims.
Ms Byrne-Nason said Irish people in France should contact their own families in Ireland and the embassy.
Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness, have issued a joint statement condemning the atrocity.
"The people who carried out this attack want to create fear and division," they said.
"Their actions have resulted in the loss of many lives of people of different nationalities. Their acts are futile and will serve only to strengthen our resolve and determination that democratic means are the only way forward."
The taoiseach, Mr Kenny, described it as an "act of madness".
"I'd like to, on behalf of the government and the Irish people, extend our sincere and deepest sympathies to President Hollande and the French people," he said.
A book of condolence for the victims of the Nice attack is due to be opened at Belfast City Hall on Monday.
Belfast City Council said the City Hall will be illuminated in the colours of the French flag, as a mark of solidarity with the French people on Friday evening.
The British and Irish embassies in France have both issued telephone helpline numbers for any of their citizens who have been affected by the Nice attack
The British embassy's 24-hour number is: +33 144513100.
The Irish embassy can be contacted on: + 33 144176700.

article Nicolae Gorea, 40, from Moldova, was more than twice the drink drive limit when he drove on the A548 in the Deeside Industrial Park on Good Friday.
A fellow trucker tried to stop him by driving to a roundabout - but he drove off, Flintshire magistrates heard.
Gorea admitted dangerous driving, drink driving and fraud.
District Judge Gwyn Jones jailed Gorea for 42 weeks and banned him from driving for two years.
The court heard he was spotted driving the wrong way along the busy road at about 22:35 BST by another lorry driver, Brian O'Connor, who tried to flag him down before driving to a roundabout to try and stop him.
But, unable to understand him, the defendant drove on, the court heard.
Mr O'Connor called the police before driving to another roundabout and eventually making Gorea stop and get out of his vehicle.
When police arrived they noticed there was damage to the front of his lorry, indicating it had been in contact with street furniture.
Checks also showed that Gorea was wanted by The Met police following a fraudulent driving licence application when a foreign Romanian driving licence had been used.
Interviewed, he said he had parked up for the night at Deeside Industrial Park on 14 April, drank between 200 and 300 millilitres of whisky and then decided to move the vehicle.
He admitted he had driven the wrong way and said he "was tired, confused and drunk."
The defendant also received a notice to be deported.
"You were driving a Romanian registered heavy goods vehicle with a 40 foot trailer on one of the arterial roots into north Wales on a busy Easter weekend," the judge said.
"You were significantly under the influence of alcohol and the manner of your driving clearly showed that."
He also praised Mr O'Connor for trying to stop the defendant and said his actions may well have helped others not to be hurt.

She said that 2017 would be the "year of the awakening" for European people.
Her comments were echoed by the Dutch politician, Geert Wilders.
"Yesterday, a new America. Today... a new Europe!'' Mr Wilders, the leader of the anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV), said while opening the meeting under heavy security in the central German city of Koblenz.
"The people of the West are awakening. They are throwing off the yoke of political correctness," he said.
"This year will be the year of the people... the year of liberation, the year of the patriotic spring."
Ms Le Pen said Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year would have a domino effect across the European Union (EU).

Ms Le Pen denounced German Chancellor Angela Merkel's migrant policy which she said had allowed huge numbers into Europe and was a "daily disaster''.
The conference of right-wing parties comes ahead of key elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany in 2017 in which they hope nationalist and anti-immigrant policies will resonate with the electorate.

article Its subsidiary, Tesco Stores Ltd, reached what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office after a two-year probe.
Tesco said there was "regret" over the issues of 2014 and said it has been working hard to "restore trust".
The firm also agreed with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to spend £85m on compensating investors.
The money will go to those who bought shares or bonds between 29 August and 19 September in 2014.
Those investors would have had misleading information from a trading statement on 29 August, which gave a rosier assessment of its performance than was actually the case.
Tesco issued a corrected statement before the markets opened on Monday 22 September, which estimated it had overstated profits by about £250m.
The revelation sent the retailer's share price plunging and sparked two internal inquiries.
Even that was not the full story, the overstatement was subsequently revised up to £326m.
The compensation order is a first for the FCA, although it has not imposed its own penalty, and Tesco has accepted the regulator's finding of "market abuse".
The SFO said Tesco had co-operated with the investigation and had undergone an "extensive" period of change.
Tesco's current chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: "Over the last two-and-a-half years, we have fully co-operated with this investigation into historic accounting practices, while at the same time fundamentally transforming our business.
"We sincerely regret the issues which occurred in 2014 and we are committed to doing everything we can to continue to restore trust in our business and brand."
A Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) is a fairly new way (introduced in February 2014) of punishing a company for criminal behaviour without the collateral damage of a conviction.
DPAs may be fairly new, but they are instruments the SFO is warming to. Just last month it announced a DPA with Rolls-Royce which saw the company pay a UK fine of £500m. In that case, the judge agreed that a criminal conviction for the company could disbar it from securing contracts - particularly in the US - which in turn could threaten the jobs of thousands of UK workers.
A DPA also avoids lengthy and costly trials and puts the offending company on probation to ensure full co-operation in the future.
It also does NOT mean that individuals escape scot free while shareholders pay the price for their conduct. Three former executives from Tesco face criminal proceedings. The SFO also quizzed the former chief executive Phil Clarke, before dropping any further action against him.
Read more from Simon here:
The DPA with Tesco Stores still needs approval by the High Court, which is scheduled to make its decision on 10 April.
This potential DPA agreement only covers Tesco Stores and does not address whether liability of any sort applies to the larger international group Tesco plc or any of its employees.
To pay for the penalty, compensation scheme and related costs Tesco will charge £235m to its results for the 2016-17 financial year, which are due to be published on 12 April.
Tesco shares were little moved on Tuesday.
Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the accounting error uncovered was "exceptionally rare" in the UK stock market.
"This is a big slap on the wrist for Tesco, reflecting the seriousness of the offence and its impact on the share price in 2014," he said.
"Dave Lewis underwent a baptism of fire when he took over as CEO in 2014, just as the accounting scandal struck. He and the supermarket will now be hoping to draw a line under the matter, and concentrate on nurturing Tesco's nascent recovery.
The Tesco scandal contains a real novelty. It is a compensation scheme for about 10,000 professional and personal investors.
They bought shares or bonds at artificially inflated values after the supermarket group put out its misleading trading statement on 29 August 2014. They suffered a loss if they were still holding those investments, when their values fell, after a correction from the company was issued a few weeks later on 22 September.
To qualify, you have to be a so-called "net purchaser" - someone who during that period bought more shares or bonds than they sold.
The compensation is 24.5p per share, plus interest. Various values, plus interest, are on offer to bond holders.
The compensation scheme will be run by the accountancy firm KPMG, and should start before the end of August this year.
KPMG will try to contact all eligible claimants. If you are one of them you will need to provide evidence of your purchases and any sales.
You will have six months to lodge a claim.
Details are available from Tesco.

He denies murdering the mother of his two children.

A "one-in-a-billion" DNA profile matching Mr Bell was found after her death on chewing gum used to secure the lock of the cupboard, Birmingham Crown Court has been told.
Mr Bell, of Regent Road, Handsworth, said his relationship with Ms Welsh, 24, ended after arguments about their goals in life.
He told the court he did not know for certain in the summer of 1981 that his former partner was seeing another man.
Asked by his barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, if he had been in the cupboard where Ms Welsh's body was found in August 1981, Mr Bell said he had been into the under-stairs room with his business partner and his brother.
He said: "The very first time we went in was to gain access to the pipe - we were going to attach a hose to the stopcock."
Claiming to have used a discarded piece of gum as a form of filler to secure the door after it was forced open, Mr Bell stated: "We were able to put the keep back on and relocate the screws.
"I have a picture of it as it happened. I re-secured it by using the screws that were there and also used a bit of gum in the place of glue."
The trial continues.

article Scores of journalists and citizen journalists have been killed since the start of the revolt in 2011.
Syria was the world's deadliest country for journalists in 2014, says Reporters Without Borders. Islamic State jihadists "enforce an information dictatorship" in the areas they control.
Foreign journalists have been among the captives whose murders have been shown in online videos posted by Islamic State militants.
In areas held by other groups, there is a flourishing, if somewhat chaotic, media scene.
Satellite TV is the most popular medium and non-Syrian TVs have big audiences. The government and ruling party operate broadcast and print media. Media in government-controlled areas are strongly supportive of the president.
Opposition satellite TVs broadcast from abroad and have proliferated since 2011; they include London-based Barada TV, UAE-based Orient TV and Al-Ghad TV.
Radio is a key platform for Syria's opposition media. At least a dozen stations operate online from abroad or on FM in rebel-held areas. Some are run by NGOs, with Western support.
The three main newspapers are state-run. Privately-owned titles are predominantly operated by figures with good government connections.
With around 5.9 million internet users by 2014 (InternetLiveStats.com), the web has emerged as a vehicle for dissent.
Facebook is the favoured platform for citizen journalists, activists, militia groups and supporters of all sides to disseminate news. Twitter has a much smaller take-up

Darren Sammy's men produced a superb performance with the ball to restrict Sri Lanka to 122-9, with Samuel Badree taking 3-12 and Dwayne Bravo 2-20.
Only Thisara Perera, who hit 40 off 29 balls, offered any resistance.
Andre Fletcher - opening the batting in the absence of the injured Chris Gayle - blasted an unbeaten 84 off 64 balls in a largely straightforward chase.
Gayle left the field during the Sri Lanka innings due to a pulled hamstring, meaning he was denied the opportunity to bat.
It's a second victory for West Indies, who beat England by six wickets on Wednesday, meaning they will qualify for the last four if they beat South Africa on Friday.
But defending champions Sri Lanka face a battle to advance, and their match against England in Delhi on Saturday now looms large, with the loser likely to be eliminated.
After their batsmen put England to the sword on a flat track in Mumbai, the West Indies demonstrated great versatility to record a completely different type of victory on a more-spin friendly pitch in Bengaluru.
The Sri Lanka innings was evenly poised at 32-2 after the six Powerplay overs when leg-spinner Badree took over.
First of all he induced Lahiru Thirimanne to spoon a drive to point, then he enticed Chamara Kapugedera to come down the track and had him stumped.
The 35-year-old - who hadn't played an international match in almost two years before this tournament - completed a superb spell of bowling by having Milinda Siriwardana caught at slip.
With West Indies spinner Sunil Narine, the world's number one-ranked T20 bowler, not playing in this tournament, Badree could have a vital role to play if West Indies progress further.
Fletcher, 28, didn't play in the first game against England, but was brought into the side at the expense of bowler Jerome Taylor.
The Grenadian was slated to bat at four but was then moved up the order due to Gayle's injury.
Batting with a fluency that eluded everyone else, the right-hander struck six fours and five sixes, scoring predominantly in front of square on the leg side.
He weathered the loss of three partners in becoming the second West Indian opener in consecutive matches to bat through.
The West Indies selectors now face a dilemma if Gayle returns to fitness: whether to preserve the current opening partnership of Gayle and Johnson Charles or pair Fletcher with Gayle at the top of the order.
More to follow.

The latest civilian victims of the chaos in Mosul are on their way here. Forty-five Iraqis needing urgent medical care after yet more violence in the Old City.
I am surrounded by medics, who are preparing to help. But all I can do is grip my camera, because I am here as a public communications specialist with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
I have come to Mosul to document what is happening, but what is happening soon overwhelms me.
I turn towards a little girl who has just been rushed inside.
I ask her name. Her aunt whispers to me that her name is Sakina. She is bleeding, so I call out to my colleagues for help.
I am not a medical worker and am already beginning to wonder: Is this serious? Will she survive?
I do not have to wait long to find out. Sakina has several wounds from an explosion.
My colleagues rush in to try to save her. Her aunt asks me to translate what the English-speaking medical team is saying, but she can see what is happening.
The medics try their best, but Sakina is dying in front us.
In Old Mosul, thousands of civilians are trapped and full of fear.
Air strikes, sniper fire, shelling and roadside bombs mean no place in the Old City is safe.
Residents are being forced to make impossible life-or-death choices as they seek to flee the violence.
Explosions shake the hospital, which lies only 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the frontline.
The staff say they do not feel in danger, but the workload is heavy. In early June they had three days in a row when 80 to 90 patients arrived all at once.
Hundreds of civilians arrive every week with terrible wounds.
Bomb blasts throw small stones deep into young bodies, a sickening kind of shrapnel that explodes up in anger from the very streets where these children used to run and play.
There is no child's play now. There are no fairy tales here. Mosul's young have been plunged violently into a real-life horror story that seemingly has no happy ending.
Parents are sucked into this horror story too - one with many chapters.
There is the father who carried his two-year-old into the hospital, suffering from a large gunshot wound to the head. And another who calmly asked a medical colleague for 22 body bags, because all of his family had been wiped out. A surgeon helped him with his request, but only after going behind a wall to cry.
Local staff are doing all they can. Some are not paid anymore, including the Iraqi medical team. Some receive incentives. Many do not, but they are still here helping. It is incredible.
I make a decision. I am here to take pictures, but I ask myself: "What am I doing behind my camera? I took some first aid courses so I am sure I can help, if only a little?"
Doctors begin giving me tasks: "Take the bandage." "Put pressure on the wound." "Quickly, over here."
I see another child who is wailing. I try to speak to her to calm her. She says: "I don't want to live without my mom. I wish I was the one who stepped on the mine."
Her face is full of shrapnel. It is the first time I have seen someone bleed from the eyes. She asks: "Am I blind?" She keeps screaming. She is terrifying everyone.
I am from Lebanon and I have seen lots of war. I am not afraid of shelling and shooting. But today I can see that our basic humanity is under attack.
I appeal to all sides in this conflict to protect civilians. Protect them all as if they were your own loved ones. Let them escape. Give them food, water and shelter. Respect the laws of war for the sake of all of us.
My thoughts once again turn to Sakina.
After she died, her aunt left the room and I followed. We cried together. I was hugging a total stranger but it felt like I was hugging my own aunt. She told me Sakina's mother and siblings had already been killed.
I now come face to face with Sakina's father, who has arrived at the hospital. He is calm, silent, but clearly deeply traumatised.
There is an Arabic saying: "There are a million words behind the silence." This is all too true as we look at each other, saying nothing.
Of the 45 patients who arrived at the hospital today, four died.
I take my camera, my pictures and my memories away with me at the end of a hot and horrendous day.
The work will go on. Patients will be cared for, beds will be changed. Floors will be cleaned. But the stain of what has happened here will not so easily be removed.

article All students will get £1,000 a year before a means-tested grant to help with living costs.
But it will be less generous to those from better off families than a threshold suggested by an independent review.
Students from households earning more than £59,200 now - not £80,000 - will only be eligible for the basic £1,000.
The tuition fee grant of £5,100 will be scrapped and replaced with a maintenance grant of just over £8,000 for students from the most disadvantaged families.
Course fees will be paid back with a loan which students will repay once they have graduated and started earning more than £21,000.
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams was responding to Prof Sir Ian Diamond's recommendations in September, following a three year review.
£1,000 grant each year for all students
£9,113 maximum level of additional support towards living costs
£7,000 average support with living costs students would receive
£5,100 existing tuition fees grant to be scrapped
£59,200 family income bracket to receive basic £1,000 grant
Ms Williams said the Welsh Government was looking to introduce "the most generous and progressive system anywhere in the UK".
She added: "If you want to go to university, this system will allow you to do so. Academic ability should determine whether you go to university, not your social background."
The changes, which should take place in the academic year 2018-19, mean:
Government sources said around a third of students would be entitled to the full grant and less than a third will get the minimum of £1,000.
About 10% of UK households have an income of over £59,000 but Welsh Government officials were unable to give a figure for the number of households in Wales earning that amount.
But Ms Williams said they had decided to limit the threshold to £59,200 "as we feel it would be sensible and prudent given the current financial outlook for the public sector in Wales".
Officials believe the changes could save at least £40m by the fourth or fifth year of operation, which would then go back into higher and further education.
Ms Williams said: "Our proposals are a fundamental shift so that Wales can develop a higher education funding and student finance system that really does provide for all."
Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar welcomed "the direction of travel" in the announcement but said there would be "an impact on the squeezed middle".
Plaid Cymru education spokesman Llyr Gruffydd welcomed many aspects of the proposals, including the central point that full-time, part-time and post-graduate study would be considered equally and would have access to similar support "that would create a more comprehensible landscape for many people".
The changes come amid concerns the current system is unaffordable.
Universities can charge a maximum of £9,000 for a full-time undergraduate course but, at present, Welsh students only cover the first £3,900.
The rest has been paid for by the taxpayer - at a cost of £237m in 2015-16.
Speaking at the time, Prof Diamond said higher education funding needed to be a "partnership between wider society and the individual".
He added: "In contrast to England, where maintenance support for students will be based on loans, we propose a significant universal element of maintenance support for full-time students."
Prof Diamond, vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, said it would mean students from Wales would face a "significantly lower average level of debt on leaving university than those from England."
Figures from the Student Loans Company show that the average loan balance for Welsh students who started repayments in 2015/16 was £16,120 - much lower than the £24,640 for English students.

article Waters stroked home after three minutes with Munns doubling the lead just after the hour mark and although Kabi Djalo's 20-yard blast tested the hosts' mettle with 12 minutes to play, the Robins weathered the storm.
Waters latched on to English Football League debutant Kyle Storer's through ball and jinked his way past Joe McNerney before sweeping to Glenn Morris' right with the first attack of the match.
Cheltenham continued to dominate but chances were at a premium with Munns rolling past the far post on 22 minutes.
Crawley improved after the restart with substitute Bobson Bawling forcing a fingertip save from Russell Griffiths, James Collins just failing to connect with Enzio Boldewijn's low centre and Djalo volleying fractionally wide.
But Cheltenham went two up when Waters had his effort headed off the line by Mark Connolly, only for Munns to slam home.
The visitors kept probing and got their reward when Bawling and Boldewijn combined to find Djalo to fire through a host of bodies from 20 yards.
Cheltenham hit the woodwork for a second time when Danny Wright collected a high free kick and nudged against the near upright late on, with the miss setting up a tense finale.

"That was one of the main things really - along with signing for a big club like Motherwell - seeing the likes of Louis Moult and Marvin Johnson go on to do well here, so hopefully I can make the same impact and kick on.
"I'm just an out-and-out winger to be honest. I play on the left side and I like to get at people and cross it - that's my game.
"I got nearly 50 assists over the past few seasons so hopefully I can emulate that up here."
Manager Mark McGhee added: "I'm really pleased that we've secured his signature because he brings a bit of balance to the squad.
"I've said it before but I feel strengthening our squad, particularly at this stage of the campaign, was hugely important and in Elliott we've not only strengthened, but brought in something we've been missing.
"I look forward with anticipation to see how well he settles in. He has the right type of attitude to fit in with the squad we have here which I feel is hugely important.
"Our business isn't finished though. We still anticipate more faces arriving between now and the deadline."

The forecaster said "scattered" storms and downpours would move north across Wales in the morning.
A lightning strike on a Gwynedd pub in the early hours of Wednesday morning caused a fire to a chimney stack.
Crews were called to the Peniarth Arms in Bryncrug, near Tywyn, and the fire was put out at 03:30 BST. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said there were no injuries.
The Met Office said about 30mm (1.2in) of rain could fall in an hour causing a "chance" of localised flooding while lightning and hail could lead to disruption of power networks.
The storms will ease in the south but could break out again in north east Wales in the afternoon, it added.
A yellow warning is the lowest level, rising in severity through amber to red for the most severe weather.

Survey work is due to start at the site in the coming weeks.
Parts of the existing road will be widened to enable vehicular access to properties, and a single track road will be built close to the existing route.
Designated parking spaces will also be provided.
The council said the scheme, at a "complex geological site" near a designated beauty spot, had "not been straightforward".
Mr Jordan added: "I am delighted we are finally in a position to start the process of allowing at least some permanent access to the properties situated there.
"I really do look forward to this scheme being finally completed and access being re-established."

article The Commons environment committee said there was a "conflict of interest" between the charity's power to prosecute and its role in investigating cases, campaigning and fundraising.
But the RSPCA defended its work and said the move was not supported by the government or animal welfare groups.
The government says it will consider the committee's recommendations.
The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee called on ministers to change the law concerning the RSPCA's role.
Everyone in England and Wales has the right to bring a private prosecution against someone who they believe has committed an offence.
The Committee recommends the RSPCA should continue its work investigating animal welfare cases, but "withdraw from acting as a prosecutor of first resort" and let the Crown Prosecution Service or other statutory bodies carry out this role.
If there were no statutory alternatives - and where a private prosecution would further its charitable aims - the RSPCA could still be allowed to bring a case, said the committee.
The RSPCA exercises its right to act as private prosecutor under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.
The charity has no legal enforcement powers or authority in its own right, so all prosecutions are brought via independent solicitors acting for the RSPCA.
The director of public prosecutions does have the right to intervene in any criminal proceedings if she feels that proceedings are unjustified.
Other charities have brought prosecutions in cases where the police or CPS haven't taken action.
The committee report also highlighted a dramatic rise in numbers of imported puppies from eastern Europe.
Puppies can be imported for commercial purposes or moved as pets under the EU Pet Travel Scheme (PETS).
Between the introduction of PETS in 2011 and 2015, the report points to a 2,055% increase in the number of dogs entering the UK from Romania. There was an 850% increase from Lithuania and a 761% rise from Hungary in the same period.
The committee recommended the government increase spot checks at entry points into the UK and that the age at which dogs can be brought in to the UK should be increased from 15 weeks to six months in order to reduce their commercial value to smugglers.
Commenting on the recommendation to the RSPCA, Conservative MP and chairman Neil Parish said the committee was not convinced the charity was in any better position to prosecute than the CPS and "should step back from making prosecutions itself".
Evidence heard included testimony from the Self-Help Group (SHG) for farmers, pet owners and others experiencing difficulties with the RSPCA which said some people felt alienated by the charity's "targeting of vulnerable, ill or elderly people" and the removal of their animals.
RSPCA chief executive Jeremy Cooper rejected the MPs' criticism.
"We are extremely proud of our near 200 years of experience investigating and prosecuting animal cruelty and our 92% success rate - which is currently a higher percentage than the CPS," he said.
But Tim Bonner, Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance, who have been critical of the RSPCA, told the Today Programme: "The RSPCA is in a position that no other private organisation is.
"They retain this prosecution role which all other charities and private individuals gave up in the 80s when the CPS was formed."
Speaking to BBC Breakfast the RSPCA's head of public affairs, David Bowles, said most of the charity's work was "about educating people to take care of their animals much better".
Last year the RSPCA spent Â£4.9 million on legal fees and cases. Mr Bowles said that represented about 3% of the charity's budget.
In a joint statement, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, Blue Cross, Cats Protection, the Dogs Trust and the PDSA said they feared that without the RSPCA, "many cases of unacceptable animal abuse would go unprosecuted".
The committee also recommended the maximum penalty for animal welfare crimes should be increased from 51 weeks to five years.
And it called for a ban on the third party sale of dogs, so they would only be available from licensed, regulated breeders or approved rehoming organisations.
Neither the SSPCA (the Scottish equivalent of the RSPCA) nor the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA) bring prosecutions, as the RSPCA does in England and Wales.

article O'Connor is surveying the terrain of his county Monaghan masterpiece Concra Wood at the launch of the venue's PGA Europro Open which will take place from 9-13 July at the Castleblayney course.
But on this particular day, Christy Jnr is speaking exactly a year after the Spanish legend's passing and memories of the great man are inevitably flooding back.
By his own admission, O'Connor was never a man behind the door when it came to the post-tournament wind-down and the Irishman's musical party piece involved the twin-track approach of pocket mouth organ and banging the spoons.
"I remember being in Barcelona Airport that night. Our plane was stuck and Seve said:'Christy…you have to show me how to play those spoons'," recalls the 1989 Ryder Cup hero.
"We spent four hours between 2 and 6 in the morning sitting on the airport floor until he had perfected it. When we finished, he was as good as I was."
It's a far cry from the cosseted world of current  golfing superstars with their private jets and superstar girlfriends but there's scarcely a trace of envy from the 63-year-old.
"We started with only 15 tournaments on the main tour. We had to play the pro-ams and then had to head back to mind the club job to try and make a living.
"I could drink my pint with the best of them. The fellows nowadays will enjoy themselves when they are off but when they are on, they really work hard and are in the gym night, noon and morning as well.
"When I won the Irish Open [in 1975] it was as good as winning it today in terms of fame or achievement.
"What has changed is the prize money. I would have loved some of that.
"But I did win tournaments such as the British Masters and other tournaments round the world where there was good pay.
"It's not all about that. It's about going out and winning tournaments, representing your country and playing in the Ryder Cup and the World Cup. I had all that enjoyment."
O'Connor's legendary uncle, Christy O'Connor Snr was also not averse to enjoying the post-round craic in the bar but that didn't prevent him from claiming 43 professional wins and playing in 10 consecutive Ryder Cup matches from 1955 to '73.
Junior is delighted to report that 'Himself', as he is affectionately known by his peers, remains in fine fettle some seven months shy of his 88th birthday.
"I played with Senior in Portugal when he was coming up to his 86th birthday at my own course in Oceanico just over a year ago.
"He played off the forward tees and shot 74 gross, two over par. That was quite unbelievable.
"He's still going out and playing a few holes with his friend Noel Fogarty at Royal Dublin five or six times a week.
"He's an inspiration to the younger guys down there on the practice ground.
"He's still as tough as ever and tell them where they are going wrong with their swings."
Christy Snr played in Britain & Ireland's winning Ryder Cup side at Lindrink in 1957 and after a losing debut in the biennial match in '75, Junior played a pivotal role as the now  European team retained the trophy at the Belfry 14 years later.
A plaque on the 18th fairway at the Brabazon course marks the spot from where O'Connor Jnr hit a remarkable 2 iron to three feet to clinch a vital singles win over a shellshocked Fred Couples.
"I had hit one of the best two irons of my life to hold the green on 17. That gave me the confidence to hit the two iron on 18.
"For sure, 231 yards was a long way to go. 190 yards to carry the water.
"But when I hit it and the ducks didn't get up, I knew at least it was on the far side.
"Fred's such a great player but I don't think he ever believed I was going to hit a shot like that with 60,000 people looking down the fairway."
O'Connor remained competitive on the European Tour for nine more years before his turning 50 heralded a lucrative seniors career on both sides of the Atlantic.
The Galway man clinched back-to-back Senior British Opens in 1999 and 2000 in addition to two victories in the US.
Junior's playing commitments have been reduced since 2006 as he largely focused his energy on an expanding course design portfolio in locations all over the globe.
"I always wondered how the great designers like Alister MacKenzie and Tom Fazio saw in a piece of land but I've really enjoyed it and have built 34 courses now.
"At Concra Wood at the start, you couldn't walk five metres without getting caught in the gorse and brairs so it was very difficult to visualise and get round.
"But I'm very proud at what we've achieved here.
"Getting the Europro tournament is a sign of how good the golf course is."
With the economic downturn affecting the course design business, O'Connor intends to return to a limited playing schedule on the European Senior Tour this year which will include the Senior British Open at Turnberry.
"Just to go out and meet my friends and hopefully shoot a few par rounds. You never know if I get it going…who knows?"

article The proposed legislation would repeal penalties for those who do not buy health insurance.
It would also replace income-based subsidies to help with the cost of premiums with age-based tax credits.
Democrats immediately criticised the plan, saying it would drive up the costs of health care.
House committees plan to begin voting on the 123-page legislation on Wednesday.
The Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, helped 20m previously uninsured Americans get health insurance.
However, increases in insurance premiums - which were also a problem before the health law - have irked many Americans.
The plan from Republicans in the US House of Representatives would reduce the role of the federal government in helping Americans afford healthcare.
"Today marks an important step toward restoring health care choices and affordability back to the American people," the White House said in a statement.
President Donald Trump looked forward to working with Congress to repeal and replace the law, it said.
The president has described Obamacare, which was passed in 2010 and is seen as Mr Obama's signature domestic policy achievement, as "a disaster".
The Republican Party has majorities in both chambers of Congress but divisions remain on the details of what should replace the Affordable Care Act, which is popular in many states, including some governed by Republicans.
The plan is expected to cover fewer people than those who gained insurance under Mr Obama.
A group of four Republican senators have already said that a draft of the legislation they reviewed did not adequately protect low-income people who received Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
They are Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
Meanwhile, three conservative Republicans in the chamber have suggested the House plan does not go far enough in abolishing Obamacare.
They are Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas.
The chamber's leadership needs the support of at least two of those Republicans if they are to succeed in dismantling Obamacare.
The proposal unveiled on Monday would preserve some popular elements of the existing law, including allowing young people to remain on their parents' insurance plans until the age of 26.
Insurers would also remain banned from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions.
While penalties for those who don't buy health insurance would be scrapped, those who let their coverage lapse could see their premiums raised by 30% by insurers.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said the bill would "drive down costs, encourage competition, and give every American access to quality, affordable health insurance".
He said no one would have "the rug pulled out from under them".
But some conservatives have already voiced concerns that the bill does not go far enough.
"It still looks like Obamacare-lite to me," said Senator Rand Paul.
On the Democratic side,  US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the plan would "force Americans to pay more, all so insurance companies can pad their bottom line".
He also criticised measures that would block for one year federal funding to Planned Parenthood, an organisation opposed by many in the Republican Party because it provides abortions.

article Unite union members voted by 83% to strike over what they say is a failure to pay holiday back pay for two years, amounting to an average of Â£700.
Unite said it would cause "havoc and chaos" for the retailer.
A spokesperson for Argos said it had "contingency plans" and that "we're working hard to ensure this will not impact our deliveries."
He added: "We would encourage both sides to keep talking with the aim of coming to a swift resolution."
Unite said the strikes were a "last resort" and its door was open for talks "24/7".
The drivers work for Wincanton, based at Argos's flagship national distribution centre near Burton-on-Trent, in Staffordshire.
That site supplies Argos's other seven distribution centres and they, in turn, deliver to the Argos shops.
Unite said the dispute with Wincanton centred on how holiday pay was calculated.
Unite says legal cases have established that overtime and extra shift payments should be taken into account when assessing holiday pay.
Unite regional officer Rick Coyle said: "The drivers have patiently tried to resolve this matter for over two years. Now they would like the money they are owed in time for Christmas, which is not unreasonable.
"It is very difficult to understand why Wincanton has allowed this saga to get out of hand."
Argos was taken over by Sainsbury's earlier this year.

article Amir Taaki is one of the key programmers behind a tool which could potentially hide the identity of people using the crypto-currency Bitcoin.
Along with Cody Wilson, the man who caused headlines for creating a 3D-printed gun, he has made the Dark Wallet.
The aim of the Dark Wallet is to make transactions done with the crypto-currency Bitcoin almost impossible to trace.
The US government and European Banking authorities are looking at regulating the use of the crypto-currency, and are particularly concerned about how the Dark Wallet could be used as a money laundering tool.
Recently those fears intensified when a blog about the technology was published and shared online.  It discussed how extremists such as IS could maintain an anonymous online presence.
The blog has not been verified - but it supported the idea of the extremist group's mission in Syria and Iraq.
It provided a step-by-step instruction guide to staying anonymous online, including how to use the anonymising Tor network - one of the ways people connect to the so-called "dark web" - and virtual private networks (VPNs) that are used to help hide people's location and identity.
The blog included an instruction manual for how to stay undercover, emphasising that the Dark Wallet could be used to "send millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin instantly from the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Ghana, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, or wherever else, right to the pockets of the Mujahideen".
"It is simple, easy, and we ask Allah to hasten its usage for us,"  the blog read.
The software allows users to anonymise their Bitcoin transactions.
It involves "trustless mixing" a peer-to-peer technology where a transaction you make will get mixed up with someone else's.
Although tipped as a future billionaire by Forbes magazine, developer Taaki spends his time living in squats around Europe.
He's currently in a central London squat, which was the centre of G8 protests last year. He points out the stained stairs where the protesters threw red paint bombs at police.
In a sparsely decorated large open-plan room sits a group of Taaki's friends, fellow programmers working on the code and design of the Dark Wallet, along with an open-source journalist and a Bitcoin investor.
Sitting on the floor on one of the cushions is Peter Todd, one of the main developers of Bitcoin.
On the walls is scribbled an address to an old Silk Road site, which has now been shut down.
When questioned Taaki indicates he is comfortable with the possibility of his software being used by extremists in conflicts in Iraq and Syria.
"Yeah, and in fact I shut down my Twitter account because they were shutting down IS accounts.
"I don't think trying to censor information is the way to go."
"You can't stop people using technology because of your personal bias. We stand for free and open systems where anybody can participate, no matter who you are."
Peter Todd agrees.
"I think obviously terrorists will use it and the benefits certainly outweigh the risk.
"Obviously terrorists use the internet, terrorists use freedom of speech and we've accepted that's a trade-off we must make."
It's not a view that will sit easily with many people, but these strong libertarian ideals are driving the political side of the Bitcoin movement.
The currency is facing on one side increased calls for regulation from people who want to see Bitcoin become a mainstream payments mechanism and on the other side key developers who are trying to maintain its anarchic roots.
Current attempts at regulation in the United States include the introduction of the Bit Licence in New York - a licence to conduct business using Bitcoin - something that the Dark Wallet developers are fighting back against.
Jamie Bartlett, author of the Dark Net, has spent time with the Dark Wallet developers in their old hacklab in Calafou, Spain.
He said: "The sort of libertarian fringes of the Bitcoin movement are actually incredibly important.
"A lot of those individuals have kept true to the original spirit of Bitcoin which always was actually a political project to try to remove the power over currency and interest rates from central banks."
For the developers of the Dark Wallet, they want their technology to be used in subversive ways, and note it could be more useful than real cash in the hands of a group like IS.
But if transactions of Bitcoin do end up in the hands of IS fighters, it may increase the calls for further regulation from governments.
"If it comes to pass that IS are using Bitcoin or Dark Wallet, any other technology of this type then public concern and public opinion about these technologies will change dramatically," says author Jamie Bartlett.
"Governments will start regulating far harder and public opinion will turn against the programmers as well, so their life could be made far more difficult, especially when they are so open they really don't seem to care who uses their technology.
"This is beyond Bitcoin - these guys are really trying to change the way the whole internet works and there's a chance they can do it."
For the Dark Wallet team, freedom from scrutiny comes above all other interests, and fits into what they see as a changing geopolitical landscape.
"Change is something that is inevitable - we're talking about the rise of ideological movements," Taaki says.
"Whether we like it or not we're going to have to deal with this new reality and we have to work with the technology with this new reality."

article The health ministry said doctors who fled in those circumstances would be guaranteed a job in Cuba and would incur no punishment or loss of status.
Some 25,000 Cuban doctors are currently working abroad in programmes organised by the island's communist government.
In the past, most Cubans who fled the country were banned from returning to the island, often for long periods.
The offer has also been extended to doctors who were allowed to emigrate on official visas, under a more open policy introduced in 2013 by President Raul Castro.
The Cuban government says it has some 50,000 health workers engaged in health projects in 68 countries. Half of them are doctors.
Critics say the highly-trained professionals are underpaid, while the Cuban government charges other countries for the service and make significant profits.
"We have agreements with other governments, by which we are compensated, with benefits to both sides," reads a health ministry statement published on the Communist Party newspaper, Granma.
"But we will continue to provide free assistance to the nations that request it. That is the case at the moment in Haiti, Niger, Honduras, Eritrea and other countries."
The United States previously accused Cuba of coercing doctors and other professionals to travel abroad and work in government programmes.
But last month the US State Department removed Cuba from its list of countries that fail to combat human trafficking.
"The Government of Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so," read the annual State Department report.

article Mhairi Convy, 18, and Laura Stewart, 20, died after William Payne passed out and his Range Rover hit them on North Hanover Street, Glasgow, in 2010.
An attempt to prosecute Mr Payne was later dropped by the Crown in 2013.
The girls' families have lodged a Bill of Criminal letters with the Crown Office in a bid to start a prosecution.
The news came the day after the family of three victims of the Glasgow bin lorry crash launched a similar bid to bring a private prosecution against the driver, Harry Clarke.
Lawyers for the families of Ms Convy and Ms Stewart delivered the papers to Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mullholland, seeking his agreement for the move.
Even without his approval, they can seek permission from High Court judges.
The lord advocate now has seven days to respond.
A Crown Office spokesman said: "The Lord Advocate has received a Bill of Criminal Letters and will give it due consideration.
"The Crown position on this will be made clear to the families and the court when appropriate."
A Scottish government spokesman said: "The decision on whether to allow a private prosecution to proceed is for the High Court however before an application can be made to the court, the lord advocate, Scotland's senior prosecutor, must be asked whether he agrees that the prosecution should go ahead."
Ms Convy, of Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, and Ms Stewart, of Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, were accounting students at the former Central College of Commerce.
The friends were on a free period when they headed towards the city centre to do some Christmas shopping on 17 December 2010.
They were fatally injured after being struck by Mr Payne's 4x4 Range Rover, which had mounted the kerb. Both students died of their injuries at the city's Royal Infirmary.
Following the crash, Mr Payne was charged with causing death by driving while uninsured but the case was  dropped.
A fatal accident inquiry later concluded the women's deaths were an accident which was caused by Mr Payne suffering a blackout while driving.
The inquiry heard that, in the three years before the accident, he had suffered six blackouts.
It concluded the deaths may have been avoided had Mr Payne disclosed his history of blackouts to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and for doctors to have advised him not to drive.

article Captain Brendon McCullum struck 65 off 49 balls as the Black Caps put on a rapid 111 for the first wicket.
Kane Williamson added a composed 57 before Corey Anderson blasted 75 off 46 balls to help the hosts to an imposing total of 331-6 from their 50 overs.
In reply, Sri Lanka subsided to 233 all out, with Daniel Vettori taking 2-34.
New Zealand, who play England next, have reached six World Cup semi-finals without ever going on to make the final.
The Black Caps, however, are one of the favourites for this tournament, and this powerful performance against the 2011 finalists underlined why they are so highly-rated.
"We executed our blueprint with the bat," said McCullum. "It was a really good performance all round. We have been waiting a long time for this so it is great to complete our plans."
Put in under grey skies, the hosts immediately attacked the Sri Lanka bowlers with some explosive hitting in the first powerplay.
Williamson recorded his 13th fifty in his last 17 ODIs, before Anderson, playing in his home city, helped New Zealand to add a crucial 102 in the final 10 overs.
Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996 and reached the final of the last two tournaments, but they will have to improve on this performance in order to challenge at this tournament.
Influential fast bowler Lasith Malinga was disappointing, conceding 84 runs in 10 wicketless overs.
Sri Lanka's chase began well, with opener Lahiru Thirimanne hitting 65, but was soon derailed by the pace of Trent Boult and the spin of Vettori.
They collapsed from 124-1 to 168-6, with Boult, Adam Milne and Vettori, who reversed his retirement from ODIs last year, capturing two wickets each, and their innings never recovered.
They will hope for a rapid return to form when they face Afghanistan on Saturday.
"They probably scored 30 or 40 runs too many and then we needed someone in our top four to get a hundred," said captain Angelo Matthews.
"But we are not going to panic, we still have five group games left."

article The Metropolitan Police hopes the scheme will fill some of the 600 detective vacancies in the force.
It also hopes to attract people with different skills and backgrounds who might otherwise not want to join.
Up to 80 detectives will be taken on initially, with further recruitment rounds likely to follow.
Earlier this year, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary said there was a policing "crisis" across England and Wales because of a "severe shortage" of detectives.
Among the reasons given were the high workload in CID units, a lack of support for trainees and the intense scrutiny detectives face.
To help plug the gaps, some forces have begun recruiting specialists in cyber-crime and fraud to help with investigations.
Scotland Yard is now going a step further by allowing people to join as trainee detective constables, with full police powers.
Unlike other recruits, they will not have to spend any time in uniform doing street patrol and response work.
They will undergo an assessment involving tests, exercises, and interviews. If selected, they will undergo 18 weeks' training.
The training will be partly classroom-based, and partly based in boroughs. It will be similar to a constable's training, but with an investigative focus.
The initial salary will be just under Â£30,000.
The training will start in January. If successful, there will be another recruitment campaign during autumn.
David Tucker of the College of Policing, which sets standards of training and ethics for police in England and Wales, said: "We are aware of the difficulties in recruiting officers and staff into investigative roles, and we are working with colleagues, including the national policing lead, to support our members.
"The College and the NPCC are looking at the extent of this issue and we are currently working with a number of forces to develop a range of initiatives to address the problem."
The Met has 5,500 detectives out of 31,000 police officers.

article The Tannadice outfit, level on points with Championship leaders Hibernian, are keen to secure the 30-year-old before Saturday's game with St Mirren.
If the two clubs and Sammon can reach agreement, he may stay at United until the end of the season on a loan basis when the January transfer window opens.
But Hearts boss Ian Cathro insists Sammon remains part of his plans.
Head coach Cathro says the Republic of Ireland cap has not been affected by Hearts fans booing his appearance as a substitute in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Partick Thistle.
Sammon joined Hearts in the summer on a three-year contract but has scored just twice in 19 appearances.
The former Derry City player first came to Scotland's top flight by moving to Kilmarnock in 2008 and subsequently had spells with Wigan, Derby and Sheffield United, among others. He has scored 76 goals in his 372 senior club appearances and has nine international caps.
"There's nothing there," Cathro said of the speculation. "I can understand it from their point of view, if that's the type of player they're looking for.
"From our side, no, and [he'll be in Friday's squad to face Dundee]. He's a strong player, a very focused guy, a top professional.
"His work every day has been exemplary, so there's no call for him to need support [after the booing]. Trust me, he's fine and he's an important player."
Hearts face Dundee, Kilmarnock and Aberdeen before the January transfer window opens.
"Business is something which is going to happen, but what's important is that I'm at a point of trying to do a lot of things very quickly but we've also got to stay focused on the most important thing, the game on Friday, the game on Tuesday and the game on the following Friday," added Cathro, who replaced Robbie Neilson earlier this month.
"We don't have a massive number of players and we need everybody pushing and fighting to give each other the absolute best shot they have at what we have ahead of ourselves in the next 10 days.
"Whilst that's going on, I have a job to do in assessing how things are and to have an idea of where I would like to move the squad when we can do business in January.
"We will begin work on that but we're not in a position where we can take even 1% off the focus on the next 10 days."

article Pamela Munro said: "We are absolutely devastated that we have lost our beautiful little girl and would appeal for anyone with information to come forward and bring justice for Paige."
The 15-year-old was last seen on Saturday morning at shops in Clydebank.
Her body was found on Monday in a wooded area near Great Western Road.
The senior investigating officer, Det Supt Duncan Sloan, said the public response to his appeal for information on Tuesday had been "encouraging".
He said officers had also carried out "significant door-to-door inquiries" and were "in the process of reviewing CCTV which may be useful to help track Paige's last movements".
Det Supt Sloan said officers were "currently working through all information...passed to the incident room over the last 24 hours".
The public is being asked for help so police can "piece together Paige's movements between Saturday 19 March and Monday 21 March", Det Supt Sloan said.
"We know that the last confirmed sighting of Paige was on Saturday morning at about 08:20 at the shop in Fleming Avenue.
"I need to hear from people who recognise her image that we have issued, and who saw her that morning.
"Paige was a very independent young lady, who would routinely make her way to work during the weekend over to Kirkintilloch from Clydebank, taking a bus into Glasgow City Centre on to Kirkintilloch."
The detective said he needed people to come forward with any information "however insignificant it may seem".
He asked: "Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area of Fleming Avenue on Saturday morning, and crucially, did you see anyone in the vicinity of Great Western Road, near to a wooded area on the A82 on Monday?
"This is a very busy route for cars, and popular with joggers and dog walkers."
Det Supt Sloan added: "I must reiterate that a team of detectives are working around the clock to try to identify who was responsible for the death of this young girl, however, we need as much information from the local community as we can in order to achieve this.
"If you have any piece of information, no matter how small, please contact the incident room and let us know."
Detectives have also announced a dedicated mobile number which people can text with any information they may have. The number is 07557 540 848.
Meanwhile, a shopkeeper who was one of the last people to see Miss Doherty alive also said he was "devastated" by Paige's death.
Mr Ahmed runs Fleming Foodstore on Fleming Avenue and knows Miss Doherty's family.
He exchanged a few words and a wave with the 15-year-old outside his store in Clydebank on Saturday morning.
Mr Ahmed told the BBC  she was "a very bubbly lassie" who was "always smiling" and "had time for everyone".
He said she "didn't deserve what she got".
Fundraising web pages set up in the past 24 hours to help Miss Doherty's family have raised more than £14,000.
Family friend Lynsay Smith set up one page and wrote: "All the money raised is to help Pamela, her mum, and Andrew, her stepdad, with any funeral arrangements and anything else to ease the pain that they are going through at this time."
Donations on the page had reached £7,300 by 14:00 on Wednesday.
A second page set up by Gail Duncan smashed the target of £3,000 within hours and had raised £6,900 by 14:00 on Wednesday.
She said the money would go to Paige's family to "spend how they see fit in honour to remember Paige".

article Researchers scanned the brains of a group of young children aged around 4 and 5 years old - and found differences in how parts of their brains work.
Around 1 in 10 people in the UK has dyslexia, which can affect the way a person sees, hears and understands words and letters. It's quite common, but nobody really knows what causes the condition.
On brain scans of adults that have dyslexia, there's an area of the brain that looks different to scans of those who aren't dyslexic.
This part of the brain - called the arcuate fasciculus - deals with word sounds and languages.
Researchers say they don't know whether dyslexia causes the change in the brain, or whether it is the other way round.
In the study, young children aged 4 and 5 years old had their brains scanned.
Researchers found that some of the children also had differences in this area of the brain - and these same children also scored lower on word tests.
The experts think this means the children may grow up to be diagnosed with dyslexia.
Though the team cannot prove this yet, they think this information can be used to help children who may be likely to have dyslexia from an early age.

article Aquatic health and safety consultant Allen Wilson tested water in a garden where raw sewage has been released by a flooded sewer.
He said the levels suggested there was a risk of water-borne diseases like Weil's disease or typhoid fever.
But Public Health England said the levels were not unusual after flooding.
Mr Wilson, from Studies in Work, took readings from a garden in the Diglis area of the city where homes have been under water for more than a week, and found bacteria measurements ranged from 40 to 1,774.
A reading of between one and 32 is considered safe, he said.
"I've never seen numbers as high as some of the ones we've seen today," he said.
"That is the utopian area for bacteria to thrive and grow and multiply."
Mr Wilson said the risk of diseases "that live and thrive in sewage" would be a lot higher than under normal circumstances.
Weil's disease is an infection contracted through touching water contaminated with animal urine, and can be life-threatening.
But Dr David Kirrage, from Public Health England, said the levels were to be expected.
"The contamination doesn't surprise us at all, it's what we get after every flood," he said.
"Over time those bacteria will be removed by oxidation, by just the action of the sun, the ultraviolet light as things die out... any pollution will eventually go away after time."
Matt Beesley, who owns the garden where the tests were carried out, said he was "very worried" by the readings.
"We've been wading in and out of it for 10 days now. We have complained and talked to people about it and still nothing has been done."
Severn Trent spokesman Ed O'Brien said the company had sent crews to try to deal with the sewage situation, but water levels remained too high.
The sewer system had been "overwhelmed" by the flooding, he said.

article Mr Murphy, who is not an MSP, has already said he will be his party's candidate for first minister at the Scottish Parliament elections in 2016.
He had faced calls to clarify his position over the Westminster seat, which he has held since 1997.
Mr Murphy was elected leader last month, replacing Johann Lamont.
A spokesman for Mr Murphy told the Press Association: "Jim Murphy is currently the MP for East Renfrewshire and the candidate.
"If that changes his constituents will be the first to be told."
Glenn Campbell, political correspondent
Jim Murphy was apparently re-selected as Labour's general election candidate in East Renfrewshire last year.
That was before he was elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party with a commitment to stand for Holyrood in 2016, if not before.
What's happened today is that, in response to media enquiries, Labour has confirmed that Mr Murphy remains a Westminster candidate.
It is not clear whether or not that position will change before the general election on May 7th.
Labour will only say that if it does Mr Murphy will tell his constituents first.
There would be nothing to stop him seeking or holding seats in both parliaments.
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme in December, Mr Murphy said: "I've given a commitment that I'll be in the Scottish Parliament in 2016 and Labour's candidate for first minister in 2016.
"I'd like to be there sooner than that and in terms of how we do that and what we do, of course I'll let my constituents know first and my constituency party know first.
"But there's a cast-iron guarantee to be a candidate in 2016 at those elections, if not before."
Former first minister Alex Salmond previously served as both MSP and MP simultaneously, but Mr Murphy previously said that option was "not something I'm attracted to".

article This guy that they'd known for his fearsome reputation as one of national hunt racing's hardest, and most difficult opponents to beat, was now motionless from the neck down, and struggling at times to breathe let alone speak.
But, remarkably, McNamara and his wife Caroline refused to be downcast, preferring to confront their plight head-on, politely asking visitors to take any tears they might care to shed outside the room.
It was that attitude of bloody-minded determination not to give in - AP McCoy had a tone of awe in his voice, I thought, when describing his friend on BBC radio as "very mentally strong" - that made him such an inspiration to so many.
And, my goodness, strength of extraordinary quantities was needed after the winner of Cheltenham Festival trophies and holder of point-to-pointing records was so cruelly propelled from saddle to 24-hour care that March afternoon in 2013.
Miraculously, when you consider the gloomy prognosis as the air ambulance took him away from the racecourse, he eventually got home to County Limerick, the area of his birth, to a specially-designed bungalow, and started working with a small number of horses and even making occasional trips to the races.
His changing room colleagues have, of course, felt it all most keenly, in the knowledge that this fate could so easily have befallen them; horses fall in jump races every day of every week, and an inch here or an inch there can make all the difference in terms of walking away or not.
But in addition, McNamara's story resonated across the racing world and on to the wider public probably to a large extent because of its poignancy.
When Galaxy Rock fell, at the first fence, in the Festival's Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Chase, the then 37-year-old was considered to still be very much at the top of his game, and memories of great days and celebrations with Cheltenham winners like the prolific Spotthedifference and Teaforthree were fresh in the memory.
Although he'd never turned professional, the principal reason had nothing to do with ability, but, crucially, that amateur status allowed him to remain a big riding fish on Ireland's renowned point-to-pointing circuit, something of a show window for potential buyers.
So, he was, as they say, going well, but he'd also spoken to friends about the possibility of retiring in the not too distant future; heartbreakingly, the decision was never his to make.
And then last year, in a barely believable twist, his first cousin Robbie McNamara was confined to a wheelchair by a fall, in Ireland, on the eve of the Grand National at Aintree in which he was due to take part.
Happily, Robbie has recovered enough to be training and, to considerable all-round pleasure, saddled his first winners in July to create some rays of light in what has otherwise been a desperately sad series of events.
The story of JT McNamara will, however, never be forgotten: memories of his rampant success in the saddle won't allow that, nor will his extraordinary courage in the face of adversity.
He leaves behind three young children and their loving mother, all of whom have much to treasure.

article Ashley Husband Powton believes the rules should change on allowing private institutions the reduced tax bill.
She will put her case to MSPs on the public petitions committee.
However, John Edward, who is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, said the charity status test was a stringent one.
He explained that private schools received charitable status because they "deliver charitable purpose like 23,500 other charities in Scotland".
Mr Edward  added: "And in their case their charitable purpose is the advancement of education and nobody questions the education they deliver and part of that is the test they are put through by the charity regulator to demonstrate what their purpose is."
Private schools serve about 4% of Scotland's pupils.
Because of their charitable status, such schools do not pay corporation tax and receive an 80% discount on their rates.
Campaigner Ms Husband Powton told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "Most elite private schools charge fees of more than Â£30,000 a year and the average wage in  Scotland is about Â£26,000 a year, so that shows just how inaccessible these schools are for most people."
She added: "Private schools represent the very opposite of what a charity should be, that is an organisation that helps the needy and the most vulnerable in society and not already the richest and the most privileged.
"The provision of a few bursaries, and it really is a very negligible amount when you actually look at the figures, cannot be allowed to mitigate the overwhelming reality that for the majority of the population a private school education is far outwith their reach."
However, Mr Edward said that he knew "for a fact" that thousands of children would be going to school on means tested bursaries "right through to 100% of the bursary".
He added: "The charity regulator was very clear in testing the schools to not just the scale of provision for financial assistance but also making sure that those most in need were able to access the services of independent schools."

Allan McGregor saved well from Aleksandar Kolarov's early free kick and did brilliantly to block Dusan Tadic's effort in the last minute.
The Scots' best opportunities fell to Kenny Miller, but the striker was unable to take any of them.
Steven Naismith and Robert Snodgrass also went close and James Forrest was denied in stoppage time.
But a victory would have flattered the Scots, who struggled at times to break down the Serbian defence.
It leaves Craig Levein's side desperately needing a win over Macedonia on Tuesday, with World Cup qualifying group A rivals Belgium and Croatia having picked up wins against Wales and Macedonia, respectively, on Friday.
The importance of having McGregor fit to play was underlined as early as the seventh minute as he got down to his right-hand post to keep out Kolarov's free kick, which had threatened to sneak in.
The early stages hinted at an open match, with both sides keen to push forward quickly.
Scotland forced a series of early corners, to no great effect, and the Serbs looked dangerous on the counter-attack - Gary Caldwell marking his 50th cap with a last-ditch challenge inside the six-yard box to deny Darko Lasovic.
The Scots began to look more dangerous when Snodgrass came to life midway through the first half. His jinking run into the box ended with a shot that Vladimir Stojkovic managed to touch wide.
Moments later, Naismith just failed to get enough purchase on a header from a teasing Snodgrass cross to trouble Stojkovic.
Paul Dixon had made an assured debut, with some good crosses from the left, and a well-timed tackle on Zoran Tosic, who was making inroads towards the Scots goal, would have settled him further.
His fellow full-back, Alan Hutton, was also getting forward well and, when a hefty challenge on him earned Matija Nastasic the game's first yellow card half-an-hour in, Charlie Adam almost caught out Stojkovic with a direct effort on goal from the free-kick.
After early signs that the goals would flow, the game fell flat, though Miller almost got lucky with a chip that landed on the roof of the net before Lazovic had a low shot well dealt with by the largely untroubled McGregor.
Stojkovic had also had a comfortable afternoon and gathered the half's final effort - an ambitious chip from Adam - with ease.

The tempo remained less-than-frenetic after the break, though Miller had a sight of goal from a Christophe Berra knockdown but could not turn it into the net.
McGregor flew to his left to ensure an Aleksandar Ignjovski drive landed wide, while a Kolarov effort flashed even closer, with the keeper beaten.
In between those attempts, though, Miller should have had Scotland in front as he twice beat the offside trap.
Stojkovic did well to come out and block the first of his opportunities, but the striker completely failed to connect with James Morrison's lob when gifted a free header six yards out.
Naismith, too, passed up a glorious chance to nudge Scotland ahead, as he latched on to Caldwell's nicely-judged pass only to screw the shot past the far post.
Another miscued Miller header with just a quarter-of-an-hour remaining had the home fans groaning and pleading for the introduction of Jordan Rhodes.
It was only a matter of minutes before both he and Jamie Mackie emerged from the bench to replace Morrison and Miller, neither of whom had enjoyed the best of afternoons.
The substitutes were not afforded the chance to trouble Stojkovic, though Forrest, who had earlier replaced Snodgrass, did.
However, he scuffed his injury-time shot straight into the arms of the keeper, moments after McGregor had done brilliantly to prevent Tadic from grabbing a winner for Serbia.
Neither side can complain at the result, though surely the visitors will be happier with the point.

Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas picked up three shots and was seven under after 14 holes when the round was ended.
That put him level at the top of the leaderboard with Sam Saunders, one of those not to hit a shot on Friday.
Officials hoped to resume play on Saturday at 7am local time (15:00 GMT).
World number six Jordan Spieth also improved by three shots in the 16 holes he managed and was five under alongside second-round clubhouse leader Cameron Percy of Australia.
Scotland's Martin Laird was one of the few to complete his round and a three-under 68 left him inside the top 10 on four under.
Vegas, one of 48 players who had returned early on Friday morning to complete a first round which had been delayed by fog, dropped only one shot in his 14 holes in round two.
He said: "I knew I was going to hit a lot of bad shots so had to find a way to get a lot of up-and-downs. Staying patient was the key."

article Sian, who's 15 and goes to school in Aberystwyth, passed the indoor skydiving exam as part of her physical education course.
It's believed Sian is the first person ever in the UK to take the exam as part of her GCSEs.
She needed special permission from her teachers before she was allowed to take it. Sian passed her exam with 'flying' colours, achieving a mark of 93%!
Indoor skydiving allows people to experience freefall without having to leap out of an aircraft with a parachute.
Sian says she "loves the feeling of weightlessness".
Both of Sian's parents are skydivers and her 83-year-old grandmother performed an indoor sky dive for her 80th birthday.
There are only three skydiving tunnels in the UK, at Manchester, Milton Keynes and Bedford.

Defender Poole joined from Newport County in September 2015, debuting in a Europa League tie in February 2016.
The 18-year-old did not make a first team appearance during the 2016-17 season but says senior players have told him to be patient for his chance.
"I made the breakthrough last year so I did want it again this year," he said.
"That's all you want as a footballer, more and more of it."
Poole says Pogba, the world's most expensive player, has been one of those to offer advice.
"People like Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba came through the youth team and they are the ones that help us as they know exactly what we're going through," he explained.
"They're all nice people and really genuine guys.
"They know it takes time. I get a bit ahead of myself sometimes and they tell me 'take your time' and 'slow down.'
"I'm 18 but some of them are 21 in the reserves now and had a little bit of a taste at the end of the season against Crystal Palace and did really well."
Poole's senior Manchester United debut was a late substitute in a Europa League game against FC Midtjylland, a game in which Rashford made his Red Devils bow.
Rashford, 19 scored twice in the 5-1 win and is now part of the first team squad as well as an England international.
Cardiff-born Poole has represented Wales at various youth levels including Under-21 and is included in the squad for the Toulon Under-20 tournament in France.
"We're really excited by it and I think we'll do well over there," Poole added.
"It's a tough start as they will have home advantage."

article Chris Wood struck his 11th league goal of the season to put the hosts ahead in the first half before a hamstring strain forced him off soon after.
Garry Monk's side only made sure of the points in injury-time when Souleymane Doukara converted a penalty.
Chris Gunter was adjudged to have pushed Charlie Taylor inside the area.
Reading's best chance of the game came right at the end when Yakou Meite's goal-bound effort was blocked by Pontus Jansson on the Leeds line.
Leeds, who responded from losing 2-0 at Brighton on Friday, had to send on Liam Bridcutt when New Zealand international Wood was withdrawn after his opening goal.
A rifled right-foot shot into the roof of the net produced his 14th strike in all competitions this season after Hadi Sacko dragged the ball back across the penalty area.
Leeds had little trouble containing a Reading side, who despite enjoying 77% possession, produced just two shots on target all game.
Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"Chris Wood's just got hamstring tightness, we won't know for another 24 hours. It didn't look like a bad one where I was, but we will have to wait.
"You can see already we can't afford to lose any more but credit to those players, they're digging in.
"Physically it's hard for them but we don't want to lose Woody, who has been integral to what we're doing."
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"I thought we played very, very well tonight, I think that was one of our best games.
"In how you play, you're not going to get 10 chances to score, but a couple during the game.
"We spoke about being patient and in the second half in the final third we could've done better in terms of decision-making.
"We should've scored before they got their first goal and then we needed to be sharper in terms of defending. Late on, we tried to force it for the equaliser and after that they got a late penalty."

article Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant has imposed a moratorium on underground coal gasification (UCG).
Mr Sargeant said this forms part of a "precautionary approach" towards the development of unconventional oil and gas resources, which includes a temporary ban on fracking.
Any council not proposing to refuse an application must refer it to ministers.
Mr Sargeant said: "The direction has been issued to require that any planning application connected to the gasification of coal must be referred to Welsh ministers where local planning authorities are minded to approve them."
It applies to any onshore application registered on or after 25 March and Mr Sargeant said it was to "avoid any ambiguity".
A study by Duke University in the US suggested synthetic natural gas emits seven times more greenhouse gases than natural gas and almost twice as much carbon as a coal plant.

article Matthew Pietrzyk has been on the donor waiting list since he was a baby having been born with a rare condition.
The kidney came from Edward Batch who heard about the Leicestershire youngster's plight following a social media campaign.
Mother Nicola said she thought he was the first UK child to have a kidney transplant arranged on social media.
Matthew, who named his new organ Eddie Junior, was diagnosed with congenital nephrotic syndrome at five weeks old.
A year later, the kidney donated by his mother had to be removed because of complications but finally, after 10 years of searching and a social media campaign, a match was found.
"We feel like we need to keep pinching ourselves," his mother said.
"The odds [of finding a match] initially were three in 10,000 and then went to 650,000 to one. Only 1% of the population had a chance of being a match. So we are just in shock. We still can't quite believe it and Matthew is just so happy."
As the odds of finding a match for Matthew grew longer the Glenfield family launched a social media campaign.
Although admitting the global campaign was unlikely to be successful, they were approached by Mr Batch - who coincidentally lived a few miles from the Pietrzyks.
After tests it was confirmed he was a match and, in July, the pair underwent surgery.
Mr Batch said: "I've got three children, if my children were ill I'd want someone to step up and help me so why wouldn't I step up and help somebody else?"
Mrs Pietrzyk said she believed her son could be the first child in the UK to receive a kidney found through social media.
"It's been a rocky couple of weeks and we've been told to expect a rocky six months. Transplant is the best possible thing for anybody waiting for a kidney. However it's not 'there you go, you're fixed, goodbye'. "It doesn't quite work that way but he's doing really well."
"He's named his kidney Eddie Junior and he wants two birthdays a year - he's completely milking it."

The men were both punched to the ground and the attackers took the 22-year-old victim's jacket.
They then made off on foot, heading east along York Place.
Police are now looking to speak to the men in the images.
One of the men in the CCTV images is white, in his mid 20s, 5ft 10ins tall, of stocky build, with short light brown hair and was wearing a bright pink jumper and dark trousers.
Another man is white, of slim build, 5ft 9ins, 20 to 25 years old, with short dark gelled hair. He was wearing a black jacket.
A third man is white, of medium build, 5ft 10ins, 20 to 30 years old, with short dark hair, wearing a brown blazer, black t-shirt and dark trousers.

article The net provider will block access with pop-up boxes until decisions are made.
In a blog post, TalkTalk adds it will prompt customers to review their settings every year.
Sky announced last week that it would activate filters for inappropriate content by default.
BT and Virgin have yet to reveal any proposals for automatic filters.
Prime Minister David Cameron has previously called on ISPs to offer services with pre-activated filters in the interests of family safety.
TalkTalk customers are presented with information about the HomeSafe filter activation in their account settings pages.
TalkTalk says 95% of its 4.2m customers have already decided whether to activate the filters.
"We pre-tick the 'on' option, but it's the customer's choice," writes TalkTalk spokeswoman Alex Birtles on the firm's blog.
"Filters will only ever be applied if the customer has consented and they're able to change their mind or edit their level of protection at any point."
Those who have not yet visited the settings page will be confronted with a pop-up box if they try to access a web page that would be blocked by the filter, Ms Birtles adds.
Like most filters, HomeSafe does not block material accessed via a web proxy or Virtual Private Network (VPN).
"There is no silver bullet when it comes to internet safety and we have always been clear that no solution can ever be 100%," said the firm on its website in a section for businesses who feel their sites have been unfairly blocked by the filter.
According to the website blocked.org, a project by the Open Rights Group (ORG), around 11% of the 100,000 top websites (according to Amazon-owned analytics firm Alexa) are currently blocked by default filters.
"Censorship should never be turned on by default," Jim Killock, executive director of ORG told the BBC last week.
"Filters block all kinds of websites, including some that provide useful advice to children and young people."

article Military courts were first set up as a response to the 2015 attack on a military-run school by the Pakistani Taliban that killed 134 children.
The courts, which try civilians charged with terrorism offences, had a two-year mandate that expired on 7 January.
The legislation still needs Senate approval before it can become law.
Viewpoint: How Peshawar military school massacre changed Pakistan
The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in January it wanted to reinstate the military courts, but lacked the two-thirds majority in parliament. After months of discussions between parties, the bill was passed late on Tuesday.
Under the original secret military court system:
The new bill, however, has some amendments, including allowing suspects to choose their own lawyer.
Under the new law, a suspect must also read the charges at the time of arrest and be produced in a military court within 24 hours, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad reports.
In their first two years, the military courts awarded death sentences to more than 160 people, of whom 20 have been executed, our correspondent says.
After the school massacre, Pakistan lifted a moratorium on capital punishment as part of measures it said were aimed at checking the spread of militancy and extremism. Since then more than 400 prisoners on death row have been hanged.
One of the main arguments made in favour of military courts is that the government cannot provide adequate security to judges who preside over terrorism related cases.
But critics say the courts lack transparency and due process.

It's the band's first single as a foursome and was released just two days after former member Zayn Malik announced a new record deal as a solo artist.
Music industry experts say Drag Me Down is currently making around Â£13,903 a day, which together with streaming plays means the track should bring home around Â£97,464 in its opening week.

article People can now check with police on whether someone has a criminal record for sexual or violent offences.
Information will then be passed on to the child's parent or guardian.
The system is already used in England and Wales. NI Justice Minister David Ford said it should make reporting easier.
"It has always been the case that people could, and should, bring concerns to the police about the safety of a child," Mr Ford said.
"These new provisions make it easier, allowing any member of the public to come to a police station and apply for information about a person who they believe is a risk to children.
"Information about criminal convictions will only be provided to the person with primary care responsibility for the specific child and only if it is necessary to protect that child.
"It is, however, important to note that if there is an immediate risk of harm to a child, this will be addressed through current child protection procedures."
PSNI Det Chf Super George Clarke said police were committed to keeping children safe.
"This scheme provides for someone to come to a police station, make an application and, in the application, they specify the child that they are concerned about and the person they believe may pose a risk to that child," he said.
"That application is then considered by the police and, where there is relevant conviction information, the police will make a disclosure to the parent or other caregiver of the child."
summary A new system for checking criminal records of children has been introduced in England and Wales.

article The charges, which include indecent assault and sexual assault, involve four boys, who were aged between 11 and 14 at the time of the alleged offences.
The ex-Crewe youth coach is accused of a total of 55 offences between 1979 and 1991 against young boys.
The 63-year-old denied all accusations during previous court appearances.
Mr Bennell - who also coached a number of junior teams in north-west England and the Midlands, some with associations to Manchester City and Stoke City - will appear at South Cheshire Magistrates' Court via video-link on 28 June.
The latest accusations include four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-14, four counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-12 and two counts of indecent assault on a boy aged 11-13.
He is also charged with four counts of sexual assault on a boy aged 11-14.
Last month, Bennell appeared at Crewe Magistrates' Court, where a further 21 child sex offences were put to him, but he did not enter a plea, and was remanded into custody.

article "Nobody is without fault but (...) he's not the person who is taking money," Corinne Blatter said.
Her comments come as key Fifa officials face a string of bribery charges.
Mr Blatter, who has been re-elected as Fifa president, has not been implicated but faces calls to stand down.
Asked whether she thought there was a conspiracy against Mr Blatter - who won re-election as head of world football's governing body on Friday despite the current crisis - Corinne Blatter said: "I wouldn't say from the Americans and the British, but certainly people working behind the scenes, yes absolutely."
She added: "I don't know if you want to call them dark forces but I mean they really tried hard, they tried in September, October last year. How can Uefa who is saying 'we are the strongest confederation', how can they not put up a candidate?"
Mr Blatter beat rival Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan on Friday in an election that was overshadowed by arrests and corruption allegations.
In September 2014, Mr Blatter had come under pressure to quit after  rejecting calls for a report into alleged World Cup bidding corruption to be made public.
Corinne Blatter's comments came as the head of the English Football Association called on Uefa president Michel Platini to unite Europe behind a collective boycott of the 2018 World Cup.
And in further intrigue, South African newspapers reported on Sunday that the nation did pay $10m (Â£6.5m) to a football association led by a figure at the centre of the Fifa allegations, despite a week of denials.
Corinne Blatter denied claims that the events of the last few days had left her father with no credibility.
"All these things happened just to discredit him so that he would resign. But I can tell you in about [two or three] weeks no one will talk about it anymore.
"Other news will be top and he'll work normally, as he said yesterday at the press conference he had a great executive meeting and everyone is going to work together. He's also the president of those who didn't vote for him and they have to work together now."
And she denied again that Mr Blatter had taken any money.
"All the money he earned he earned it by working and he is a hard working president.
"All these people who say that he takes money I don't know what kind of money he should take and he's not the kind his character is not like that, he's not taking any money."

article The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, ended a 500-year-old relationship when he moved the islands from Winchester to his own diocese.
Details of the interim arrangement have now been released.
The Canterbury diocese has taken responsibility for finance, ministry and training and safeguarding.
The changes mean the Winchester diocese will keep legal responsibility for administrative affairs, for example issuing licenses for new clergy, however, appointments would be overseen by the Bishop of Dover, the Right Reverend Trevor Wilmott, who is the archbishop's representative.
The money sent from churches in the island, known as the share, will not be sent to Canterbury, but will be held separately from its other finances, said the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Reverend Tim Dakin, and Bishop Wilmott in a joint letter.
They said: "We believe that it's important to keep such separation of accounts precisely because these interim arrangements do not create a legal separation.
"[They] will only run until such time as any recommendations from the archbishop's commission, yet to be established, are brought forward, considered and subsequently implemented."
The aim for the new arrangements was for them to begin on 1 January 2015, but the bishops said "there may be some issues" that needed "further conversations".
Timeline of diocese split
March 2013 - Bob Key, the Anglican Dean of Jersey, has his commission withdrawn by the Bishop of Winchester Tim Dakin over concerns about his handling of a parishioner's complaint about abuse in 2008. It followed the publishing of a report by the Diocese of Winchester's Safeguarding Panel. An inquiry into the handling and another into how Anglican churches in the diocese protect vulnerable people begin.
April 2013 - Dean Key is reinstated after apologising for anything he might have got wrong in the handling of an abuse complaint.
August 2013 - Concerns are raised by Anglican church members in the Channel Islands about their relationship with the Church of England.
November 2013 - Inquiry into the handling of the complaint recommends no disciplinary action should be taken against any Jersey Anglican clergy member and finds no evidence of wrongdoing by Dean Key. The final report is kept confidential on legal advice.
January 2014 - The breaking down of relations between Dean Key and Bishop Dakin leads to the Archbishop of Canterbury temporarily moving oversight of the islands to the Bishop of Dover Trevor Wilmott, who is based in the Diocese of Canterbury, in a split in the 500-year-old relationship.
March 2014 - Concerns are raised by church goers that money continues to be paid to the Winchester diocese.
July 2014 - The Church of England reveals it has spent £190,000 on handling the split, while a lay members suggests it has cost more than £600,000.
summary The Church of England has formally dissolved its relationship with the Isles of Scilly.

article Paramedics were ruled out of strike action on Thursday evening when management declared a "major incident".
Staff were canvassed on Friday to see if they would remain on duty to respond to serious and life-threatening calls if the major incident was stood down.
Only 10% of the 41 crews said they would remain on duty.
The Ambulance Trust said in the absence of a concrete commitment from enough staff to sustain a safe service, the trust said it had been left with no option but to keep the major incident in place.
The trade union, Unison, said the decision came as no surprise to them and that there was a serious loss of good will among ambulance staff.
In a text to staff at 2340 GMT on Thursday, the Ambulance Service said: "Please be advised that a major incident has been declared due to critical levels of cover and in line with the guidance issued by your union you are expected to report for duty as normal."
Management said they had been forced to take the measure "to maintain a safe level of ambulance cover".
Unions reacted angrily accusing management of "pulling a stunt" and said the move was "provocative".
The Ambulance Service said it was "inundated" with calls saying staff would be striking.
In a statement to the media, it said it had "exhausted all alternative contingency options, and lives would be at risk if we allowed the situation to deteriorate further".
Due to previous agreements between management and unions, it meant crews were required to turn up for duty on Friday.
In a tweet, the Ambulance Service added: "Two cities and many towns without ambulance cover is the only reason NIAS declared major incident."
John McPoland of the Ambulance Service said at midnight there were seven crews available for all emergencies across Northern Ireland.
"If we hadn't have declared a major incident because the level of services had decreased so much, we would be left with a situation this morning, where rather than having to explain a major incident, I could have been in here trying to explain to some family why a child who was choking in Newtownabbey, a three-month-old child, had perhaps died," he said.
"Last night we had no crews to respond to any emergencies in Belfast".
This is an extremely serious development; an obvious breakdown of communication between both parties -  management and unions.
Last night, the NI ambulance service received a steady stream of calls from ambulance crews saying they were withdrawing their labour at midnight.
A decision was taken by management to declare a major incident across Northern Ireland.
That was due to not having enough staff as opposed to there actually being an incident.
Many people are furious, accusing management of acting in bad faith. Those I spoke to said management had been told as early as last Friday that there would be a substantial walkout.
They said there was inadequate forward planning.
In a worrying development, there is talk of further action, what's been described as triggering a blue flag day.
That is when crews book a sick day on a date agreed among themselves with little or no notice given in advance to management.
However, some paramedics described management's response as "despicable" and a "purely tactical measure".
Ambulance crews had earlier agreed to respond only to 999 calls for cases that are life-threatening.
Patricia McKeown of the union, Unison, said the service's decision to "declare a major incident across the whole of Northern Ireland two hours in advance of strike action is provocative".
"There are no indications that such a major incident exists," she said.
"Ambulance staff have the right to strike and we will support our members who chose to exercise their right.  By declaring a major incident NIAS has effectively binned the agreements reached earlier."
She said the Ambulance Service move could be "irreparably damaging industrial relations".
Kevin McAdam of Unite accused management of "pulling a stunt".
"We advised our members to return to normal roles in response to the NIAS's action in line with undertakings we had given," he said.
"The trade unions know now the facts on the ground: that there was no major incident, rather there was an inability and unwillingness for management to effectively manage the strike.
"We are unhappy and disgusted by the NIAS cynically exploiting this part of the emergency cover understanding to thwart the industrial action."
summary A strike by ambulance staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Glasgow has been called off.

Brownlee, who had to be carried over the line by brother Alistair in Mexico, was returning to action in Japan.
He carried his damaged bike a mile to the next transition in Yokohama to take part in the run and finished 42nd.
Spain's Mario Mola won the event, with Bermuda's Flora Duffy earlier winning the women's event.
"My first reaction was to get back on the bike, get back riding," said Brownlee.
"But then I got to my bike and the handlebars were pointing in the wrong direction and I couldn't move it.
"I still wanted to run - I had not come all the way to Japan not to finish."
Gordon Benson and Tom Bishop were the highest-placed British finishers in the men's race in 10th and 11th respectively.
The 2017 series is led by defending champion Mola from fellow Spaniard Fernando Alarza, who was also second to Mola in Japan.
Sophie Coldwell was the fastest Briton in the women's race as she came home fourth, one place ahead of compatriot Vicky Holland. Non Stanford, Jessica Learmonth and Lucy Hall were seventh, eighth and 11th respectively.
Stanford and Learmonth also crashed in the wet conditions but, unlike Brownlee, were able to remount.
In the Para-triathlon races, Britain won three gold medals, two silvers and two bronzes.
Andy Lewis was first in the PTS2 category, and Dave Ellis and his guide Jack Peasgood won the men's visually impaired race, while Alison Patrick and her guide Nicole Walters finished top of the standings in the women's equivalent.
Brownlee, an Olympic silver medallist at Rio 2016 and a bronze medallist at London 2012, had missed the first two races of this year's World Series - in Australia and the United Arab Emirates.
In wet conditions in Yokohama he veered into the railings on his bike when trying to avoid a rider who had fallen in front of him.
Rather than concede his race was over, Brownlee ran barefoot for the final half-lap of the cycling discipline - about a mile - carrying his bike.
The 27-year-old eventually finished six minutes 56 seconds behind the winner.
"It was going quite well - the swim went really well," he said.
"On that course you want to stay high up in the field to avoid crashes. I was sitting in fourth to avoid crashes, but then an athlete just crashed in front of me.
"I was very, very lucky not to break anything in the crash. I've watched the video back and I could easily have two broken collarbones.
"I'm just disappointed - I come to races to race and I didn't get a chance."
The next race in the series takes place in Leeds, when Yorkshire-born Jonny could be joined by brother Alistair, who is focusing on long-distance triathlons this year.
You can watch highlights of the races on BBC Two from 13:00 BST on Sunday, 14 May.
Brendan Purcell, British Triathlon performance director, added: "The rain caught us by surprise. We were expecting rain, but it got heavier and heavier.
"When the guy went down in front of Jonny, he had nowhere to go. The bike couldn't be fixed, but he wanted to do a run as he feels he's in good form.
"I come away reflecting on the positives from the swim in particular, there were a lot of good performances. No-one had the perfect race, maybe apart from Sophie, but they delivered a set of solid results."

article The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy grew by 0.4% in the quarter, compared with an earlier estimate of 0.3%.
Growth was boosted by a better performance from the construction industry than previously estimated.
On an annual basis, the economy grew by 2.9% from the first quarter of 2014, up from a previous estimate of 2.4%.
The latest revision is the third estimate for the period.
For 2014 as a whole, economic growth was revised up to 3% from 2.8%.
The ONS figures showed household disposable income grew by 4.5% year-on-year, the fastest annual pace since the second quarter of 2001.
Earlier this month, the ONS said construction output in the UK was 0.2% lower in the first quarter, rather than 1.1% lower as previously estimated.
"The slight upward revision to growth in the first quarter of 2015 is down largely to the recently announced new methods to  measure construction output," ONS chief economist Joe Grice said.
Quarterly growth in services output was left unrevised at 0.4%.
Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, forecast economic growth would accelerate in the three months to June as the uncertainty caused by the general election in May subsided.
He said he expected the economy to grow by 0.7% in the second quarter and by 2.5% over the course of the year.

article The crocodiles are bred for their skin and meat at a farm owned by members of the influential Rosenthal family.
The United States treasury department froze their assets last month over allegations of drug trafficking.
A Honduran firm donated two tonnes of cow entrails to feed the crocodiles and some lions which also live at the farm.
The US treasury on 7 October froze the assets of Jaime Rosenthal, his son Yani and nephew Yankel.
Yankel Rosenthal had been arrested the previous day at Miami airport.
US investigators accuse the three of money laundering and drug trafficking.
On Friday, the state-run Forest Conservation Institute donated 1,500kg (3,000lb) of chicken to the farm after news emerged that the animals had not been fed since the Rosenthals' assets were frozen.
But local media reported that the farm's employees refused to feed the animals until their wages had been paid.
The Forest Conservation Institute said it would find a way to reach an agreement with the workers.
On Tuesday it announced that a local firm which regularly supplied the crocodile farm had donated two tonnes of cow entrails and that both the entrails and the chicken had been fed to the animals.
The farm's manager said the food would last for "two to three days".
About 11,000 crocodiles and seven lions live at the 30-hectare farm.
As well as the crocodile farm, the family owns a newspaper, a football club and a bank.
The bank, Banco Continental, is being liquidated, and the newspaper, Tiempo, has not been published since last week.
The Rosenthals have played key roles in Honduran politics for decades.
Jaime Rosenthal, 79, served as the country's vice-president from 1986 to 1990 and ran for president on a number of occasions.
Yani Rosenthal, who also had presidential aspirations, was a government minister from 2006 to 2009. Yankel is also a former minister and owns one of Honduras' most famous football clubs.

article Texting can also cut pupil absence, according to the Queen's University Belfast evaluation.
The programme involved 15,697 pupils in 29 schools across England, half of whose parents were sent texts.
Schools have been using texts to communicate with parents for some time, according to head teachers' leaders.
The pupils who took part in the study were from Year 7 - the first year of secondary school, Year 9 and Year 11 - the GCSE year.
The parents of about half the pupils involved in the trial were sent roughly one text a week during the school term, for a year starting in September 2014.
Overall, the programme amounted to about 30 texts over the year.
They included the dates of upcoming tests and warnings about missed homework as well as details about what the children had learned during the day, aiming to prompt conversations at home about school.
In each school, either the parents of the Year 11 group or the Year 7 and Year 9 groups were allocated to receive the texts.
The researchers carried out baseline tests to determine pupils' abilities at the beginning of the year and used figures from the National Pupil Database to determine their progress.
They found that the intervention appeared to have "an extremely small, positive, yet statistically significant impact" on attainment, particularly on maths and absenteeism.
The researchers found the effect of the intervention was not statistically significant in English and science.
The texts cost the schools about Â£6 per pupil over the year, says the report.
The study was one of a series funded by the Education Endowment Foundation.
EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said the "simple and cheap" programme could be "a better bet for schools" than persuading parents to attend school-run parenting classes, particularly at secondary school.
Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, agreed using text and social media could be "a highly efficient way of communicating with parents".
Mr Trobe was particularly impressed with the impact of the texts on pupil absenteeism, shown in the trial.
He said that as long as the system was easy for schools to operate, did not incur excessive costs or add to teachers' workload leaders "this is something that schools can take on and develop".

article The university is in turmoil amid separate investigations into the conduct of chairman William Taylor, and vice chancellor Wendy Purcell.
Confidential emails have emerged detailing longstanding fears that Mr Taylor was "destabilising the institution" and demanding he resign.
The university declined to comment.
A spokesman said: "These matters are part of the ongoing investigation, the board will not be commenting further."
The emails were written to deputy chairman Steve Pearce in April, by Barbara Bond, who then held the ambassadorial role of pro chancellor and is a former chair of governors.
The correspondence, in which she claims to represent the views of a number of senior staff, warns that Mr Taylor's refusal to engage with Prof Purcell to resolve the dispute between the pair has helped "provide a case for constructive dismissal".
It also claims Mr Pearce, a former assistant chief constable with Devon and Cornwall Police, could see "no way forward with mediation" between the pair.
Mrs Bond felt the situation was so serious she raised the matter with the university's chancellor, Lord Jonathan Kestenbaum.
The emails also reveal the row had left Prof Purcell in "such a dark place", claim that Mr Taylor "did not understand the role of chair of governors" and that he was "unwilling to learn about the role - especially from a woman".
Mrs Bond wrote: "Senior staff continue to approach me, unsolicited and uninvited,  and share their concerns, some of what I pick up has caused me grave concern."
They conclude: "The bottom line is that Bill needs to stand down. The university is being destabilised.
"There needs to be an immediate resolution - this is debilitating and destabilising."
The revelations are the latest blow to the university after separate investigations were launched into the conduct of its two most powerful executives.
Mr Taylor agreed to "step aside" in August while an investigation into claims he sexually harassed staff and students is carried out.
Mr Taylor, a retired judge, categorically denies the allegations, which were submitted by Prof Purcell on behalf of a number of women.
Prof Purcell was suspended in June, the university has not revealed the reason.
A senior barrister has been appointed by the university to support its investigation into allegations against Mr Taylor.

article Firms with 50-99 employees will not face a tax penalty until 2016 if they fail to provide health insurance to their workers, it was announced.
The requirement for companies with over 50 workers to offer health coverage had already been delayed a year until 2015.
The reform has been beset by technical problems and political opposition.
It aims to extend health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, partially by imposing tax penalties on individuals who do not carry health insurance and on some companies that do not offer it to their employees.
The change, announced by the treasury department on Monday, also amended the requirements for companies with 100 or more employees - they must only offer coverage to 70% of their full-time workers in 2015, and 95% of their employees in 2016.
A treasury official told the National Journal that companies would have to prove they were not shedding workers in order to qualify for the additional time.
The law only requires business with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance coverage. Individuals not covered by an employer or government plan will face a tax penalty in 2014 if they do not purchase insurance on their own.
One business group, the National Retail Foundation, praised the newly announced implementation delay for medium-sized companies.
It said the regulations "secured the gold medal for greatest assistance to retailers, and other businesses, and our employees".
But the conservative US Chamber of Commerce, America's largest business lobby group, said the delay caused "new problems for companies by moving the goalposts of the mandate modestly when what we really need is a time-out".
The Democratic president's flagship domestic achievement was passed in 2010 with no support from the Republicans, who have sought to undermine or repeal it at every turn.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known widely as Obamacare, has been bedeviled by problems and postponements during its roll-out.
Last week, congressional budget analysts predicted the health law would cut the US workforce by the equivalent of 2.3 million workers by 2021.

Genoa were awarded the title in 1919, but it may now be shared with Lazio.
"It is a legitimate Scudetto," said Lazio president Claudio Lotito.
"It was taken away from us by the war."
Italian media have said the original decision was based on the reasoning that Genoa were generally regarded as the better of the two teams.
More than 30,000 Lazio supporters signed the petition and the FIGC will announce on 4 August whether Lazio will share the title.

article The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed.
The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated.
The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry.
The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city.
In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality".
They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe."
Enemy within
The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East.

The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die.
Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs.
While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences.
Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.
The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America.
"The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn."
Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission.
During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area.
Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime.
Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance.
"There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed.
"If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to."
"To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move."
He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow.
"Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained.
"It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash.
"So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement."
Touch wood
The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam.

However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks."
He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB.
In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK.
The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012.
And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings.
Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB.
Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations.
"European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested.
"There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy.
"Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition.
"This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling.
He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species."

article Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith has been accused of running a "desperate" and "racist" smear campaign against his Labour opponent Sadiq Khan.
Clearly incensed at the accusation - which he rejects - Mr Goldsmith has pushed full steam ahead with his claims that the Labour candidate has given "oxygen to extremists".
Mr Khan, in turn, fiercely denies this.
None of the above sounds particularly positive. Ask either of these candidates who is being negative, though, and they will tell you it's the other guy.
If a negative election campaign is one that seeks to discredit one's opponent, then both sides have been doing that to varying degrees.
Let's start with the language used by the Conservatives: "radical", "divisive" and a "dangerous experiment". That's how Mr Goldsmith has described his opponent.
Labour argues this was to plant the false idea in the minds of voters of their man as a radicalised Islamist.
The Tories say that Labour has deliberately misinterpreted the word, and they were referring to what they see as Labour's left-wing, radical direction under new leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The Conservatives have put out several posters to that effect, presenting Mr Khan as "Corbyn's man", which have popped up at Labour events.
Just this week Conservative activists were seen waving anti-Khan banners at a Labour campaign visit in Sutton, south-west London. Mr Goldsmith's team would not confirm whether the gatecrashers were part of their campaign.
But Labour has been getting in on the negative poster adverts too, such as the one on housing that bore an uncanny resemblance to Conservative posters.
Mr Khan too has called his rival "divisive" and drew up a mock CV on social media at the start of the year painting the Conservative as "a serial underachiever" who wasn't up to the job of mayor.
Recently, the criticism has become even more direct.
At a debate on Tuesday Mr Khan began by saying he was "disappointed" with the strategy used by his opponent - and Mr Goldsmith fought back, telling him: "I have never referred to you by your religion."
Neither wants to be presented to potential voters as an Islamophobe or indeed as an Islamist sympathiser, but winners often take no prisoners.

article It was able to destroy or disrupt the growth of neural progenitor cells, which build the brain and nervous system, in lab tests.
The discovery, published in the journal Cell Stem Cell, adds weight to claims that Zika is causing brain abnormalities in babies.
However, the US researchers caution this is not yet the conclusive link.
There have been more than 4,800 confirmed and suspected cases of babies born with small brains - microcephaly - in Brazil.
It is widely thought that the Zika outbreak is to blame, but this has not been scientifically confirmed.
The team from the Johns Hopkins, Florida State and Emory universities infected a range of tissue samples with Zika virus for two hours and then analysed the samples three days later.
The virus was able to infect up to 90% of neural progenitor cells in a sample leading to nearly a third of cells dying and the growth of the rest being disrupted.
A similar effect in a developing brain could have devastating results.
The virus was able to infect only 10% of other tissue types tested including more advanced brain cells, kidney cells and embryonic stem cells.
Prof Guo-li Ming, one of the researchers, said the findings were significant and represented a first step to understanding the link between microcephaly and Zika.
She told the BBC News website: "Neural progenitor cells are especially vulnerable to the Zika virus.
"They are giving rise to the cortex - the primary part [of the brain] that shows reduced volume in microcephaly.
"But this research does not provide the direct evidence that Zika virus is the cause for microcephaly."
She said studies looking at brain organoids or animal studies were still needed.
David Shukman, Science editor, BBC News
In the overcrowded hospitals of Recife, the teeming Brazilian city at the epicentre of the crisis, medics have long assumed that the Zika virus is to blame.
In a sweltering waiting room last month, where anxious mothers were clutching babies with abnormally small heads, Dr Angela Rocha told me that she was convinced of the link.
In a normal year, she said, she might see five suspected cases of microcephaly while in the previous few months she had seen more than 200.
When I asked whether it would be wise to wait for a full scientific analysis with peer-reviewed conclusions, she looked at me with scorn.
With so many cases, and more in prospect after the next rainy season, we do not have time to wait, she said.
It is unclear why these cells should be so vulnerable, but it appears they do not mount an immune response to Zika infection.
While not definitive, the study adds to mounting evidence including Zika being discovered in the brains of dead babies as well as in amniotic fluid.
Brain development researcher Dr Madeline Lancaster, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, said the study was a "significant step forward".
She told the BBC News website: "The effect they see could well explain the surge in microcephaly and it opens the door for many further studies into how the virus is affecting stem cells and whether this affects their ability to generate neurons in the developing brain.
"I think it's a very important contribution and is extremely timely."
But she agreed with the researchers that more research was needed to "test whether Zika does indeed affect neuron generation and brain size" as well as how it crosses the placenta.
Dr Bruce Aylward, from the World Health Organization, said the evidence was mounting that Zika was causing microcephaly and another condition - Guillain-Barre syndrome.
He said: "Since the public health emergency of international concern was declared back in February, the evidence that there may be a causal relationship has continued to accumulate."
Meanwhile a study in Rio de Janeiro has added extra evidence to the microcephaly link.
It looked at pregnant women coming to hospital with a rash between September 2015 and February 2016.
Out of the 42 testing positive for Zika, ultrasound scans showed 12 had babies with abnormalities.
There were no abnormalities in the babies of the 16 women who did not have Zika.
The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded: "Zika virus infection in pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes."

article Sajmon Brzezinski, 43, brought the man from Poland to Nottingham in 2011.
He forced him in to work, giving him just £20 to £30 per week of his £480, police said.
Brzezinski, who owned multiple cars and properties, admitted one charge of human trafficking and two of forced labour at Nottingham Crown Court.
Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands
He also owned a home in his native Poland which police described as a "palace" with 50 windows.
Brzezinski, of Overdale Road, Old Basford, met the man at a building site in Poland, and offered him travel to the UK for £60 so he could find work.
When he arrived, police said, his passport was taken from him and he was told he owed £2,000.
Brzezinski set up bank accounts for the 38-year-old, into which his wages were paid, but kept his bank card so he was unable to access the money.
Eventually, the worker confided in a colleague at a Christmas party, which led to Brzezinski's arrest.
Jon Hammond employed the worker on a farm near Arnold, Nottingham, from 2013 and said it was "shocking" to find out he was being exploited.
"You can't see it. It is happening under your nose and when it pops up, when you finally find it, it is embarrassing, it is abhorrent. It made me hugely angry," he said.
"To us, there was nothing wrong. It is quite frightening that this stuff is happening."
The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA) began an investigation with Nottinghamshire Police after Mr Hammond's company contacted them.
Ian Waterfield, the GLAA's head of operations, said Brzezinski controlled the man's work in the UK through threats of violence.
Brzezinski also admitted a charge of fraud against another victim and is due to be sentenced on 15 June.

article Earlier, France and Germany complained that the Minsk peace deal for Ukraine was still not being fulfilled.
Russia's military interventions, first in Ukraine, then in Syria, were high on the EU summit agenda in Brussels.
But Italy and Slovakia want sanctions, that have cost EU exporters billions of euros, eased. The summit focused on the crises in Europe's neighbourhood.
The destruction of Aleppo and the exodus of Syrian refugees, migrant pressure from Africa and Ukraine's conflict with Russia were key themes.
Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 triggered the first round of sanctions.
They have been ratcheted up, targeting Russian arms exporters, banks and individuals - many of them close to President Vladimir Putin - blamed for the pro-Russian insurgency in Ukraine.
But this summit will also be remembered for its new language on ties with Ukraine - setting limits to EU support.
Other stories:
The far-reaching EU-Ukraine Association Agreement was stalled in April when Dutch voters rejected it in a referendum.
So the leaders addressed Dutch anxieties with a new, legally binding EU text. "The Agreement does not confer on Ukraine the status of a candidate country for accession to the Union, nor does it constitute a commitment to confer such status to Ukraine in the future," it said.
The EU will not offer Ukrainians the right to reside and work in the EU, nor offer EU military assistance. Any such help is a matter for individual governments.
The leaders also sought to defuse EU tensions over the many boatloads of migrants still crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa.
A plan to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Italy and Greece has been opposed by Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. Only a fraction of those refugees have been moved.
Italy says record numbers of African migrants have reached its shores this year.  Nigeria and Eritrea are the top countries of origin. Dire poverty drives many towards Europe.
"It's a structural problem that 80% of the arrivals [in Italy] have no right to asylum, so they cannot be relocated inside the EU," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.
The EU sees its controversial March deal with Turkey as a model for similar deals in Africa. One with Niger is the most advanced.
A key goal is to break the business model of the people-smuggling gangs who prey on migrants' misery.
Since March the migrant influx to Greece has fallen dramatically, but Turkey accuses the EU of blocking its EU ambitions and failing to meet funding pledges.
Mrs Merkel voiced solidarity with Turkey as it is hosts 2.7m Syrian refugees - far more than any EU country.
She said all the EU leaders "recognised that even if there are very critical remarks, it is still our close neighbour".
The suffering of Syrian civilians in devastated Aleppo overshadowed the talks.
The EU strongly condemned the bombardment by Syrian government forces and Russian warplanes.
Mrs Merkel called the bombing of hospitals "really awful". "We don't lack the will to help," she said - but she deplored the failure of UN mediation in Syria.
As the leaders met, buses began evacuating thousands of desperate civilians from the city's besieged rebel-held area.
The summit included plans to strengthen EU-Nato links in key areas, including "hybrid threats" - such as cyber-attacks - and maritime security.
Poland and the Baltic members - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have not only urged the EU to support Ukraine, but also voiced alarm over Russia's heightened military presence in the Baltic.
Russia is accused of "provocative" air patrols and missile deployments in the strategic Kaliningrad region.
The EU Commission has put forward a "European Defence Action Plan",  envisaging much more pooling of EU defence capabilities.
The summit conclusions say this defence roadmap will be developed speedily in 2017.
The EU Commission says "the EU's security situation has deteriorated significantly".
And it says European defence is too fragmented and wasteful. It criticises duplication - the EU has 19 types of armoured infantry fighting vehicle, compared with one in the US.
The UK has warned that joint EU military efforts must not duplicate Nato, and it is strongly opposed to the idea of a European army. Such a proposal is not on the table, but closer military co-operation is, ahead of the UK's Brexit negotiations.
An added worry for the EU is US President-elect Donald Trump's warning that Europe must spend more on defence.  Some EU countries fall short of Nato targets for defence spending.

"There's been 20 wars between England and France," he added. "That's a lot of rivalry there. There is another one happening on Saturday."
However, Jones does not believe the rivalry will affect his players' professionalism.
"I coach them to be emotionally right for the game," he said. "If we need that 'let's get stuck into the French' type situation' I'll leave it to the assistant coaches to do it.
"I don't think we need that. If we need that then there's something wrong. I don't believe teams are motivated by that."
The former Australia and Japan boss has enjoyed 13 straight victories since taking charge of England, but is wary of complacency against a French side looking to improve on a fifth-placed finish in last year's tournament.
"It's always going to be there," he said. "It's not something you can get rid of, like a fungus.
"We are going to face a side that's desperate for success. They are under pressure to play with French flair.
"It's really important that we're in the game right from the start and that's in the head. We have to front up, do the business."

article Varndell, 31, who has been the joint record-holder since joining Mark Cueto on 90 tries in January, will start when Bristol host Harlequins on Friday.
"I'm there to finish off moves. It [the record] is important because, if I'm scoring, we're going to be doing well as a team," he told BBC Points West.
"To be top try scorer and hold that record would be fantastic for me."
The former Leicester Tigers and Wasps man, who has scored five tries in seven top-flight games this season, added: "I'd love to be standing alone at the top of that table."

article Holyhead coastguards, an inshore lifeboat and an RAF rescue helicopter helped four kayakers after they capsized off Church Bay at 13:12 BST.
At about the same time, Swansea coastguards said teams rescued two people in capsized dinghies and another three people when a catamaran capsized.
A spokesman urged caution, adding the winds were a 'choppy' force six.
He said two dinghies capsized off Penmaen, which resulted in two people in the water.
Oxwich coastguard rescue team, Mumbles all-weather lifeboat and the Horton inshore lifeboat were scrambled, but the casualties were picked up by a passing vessel and taken to Oxwich Bay safely.
As the teams finished dealing with that incident, they were scrambled to reports of a capsized catamaran off Port Eynon point.
Two adults and a nine-year-old girl were in the water, but again were picked up by a passing vessel.
A Swansea coastguard spokesman said: "They could have been two very nasty incidents.
"It's a bit choppy out there. There are force six winds so we would advise people to stay within the limits of what they are capable of."
The Holyhead incident involved a man and three children, but all were uninjured.

article More than 1,500 children were held over alleged firearm offences between 2013 and January 2016.
Among the figures, the Metropolitan Police made 679 arrests, while seven children aged under 11 were held in Nottinghamshire.
The number of arrests rose by 20% last year, the Press Association said.
The data, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, showed 1,549 children were arrested for suspected crimes involving firearms, air weapons or imitation guns.
A total of 506 charges were brought by police.
The brother of a fatal shooting victim said he believed gangs were using children to carry guns to avoid detection.
Ian Cameron Swanston, whose 20-year-old brother Dorrie was shot dead in Hulme, Manchester in 1999, also said some youngsters carried guns for "status".
Mr Swanston, who is a counsellor and trustee of the charity Mothers Against Violence, said: "The more guns within the community, the more likely it is we will see younger children getting access to them.
"Gangs use children, they use their girlfriends. They use people who the police are unlikely to search.
"For some it's about status. Having a gun is seen as having power and people become fearful of you."
Merseyside Police said 73 children were arrested between 2013 and 2015. Fourteen boys were charged with crimes involving firearms including robbery, possession of a firearm, possession of an air weapon in a public place, sending threats, wounding and false imprisonment.
West Midlands Police said 83 boys and one girl had been charged with firearm offences since 2013, including an 11-year-old boy in 2015, a 12-year-old boy in 2013 and eight boys aged 13.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said nine boys and one girl were arrested for suspected firearm offences in 2015, compared with six boys in 2014 and seven boys and one girl in 2013.
Greater Manchester Police, which has investigated a string of gang-related shootings since "Salford's Mr Big" Paul Massey was shot dead in July, and Police Scotland were among the forces which did not provide figures.
Among the other forces which provided data:
A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said firearms offences in the UK accounted for less than 0.2% of total recorded crime.
"Forces across the country and community safety partnerships are working together to prevent young people getting involved in gangs and firearms," he said.
"This is a key piece of work for all agencies and communities in breaking the cycle of young people becoming involved in gangs and the associated criminality."

article About 180 of the jobs are to go from adult social care, 30 from children's departments and 90 others from across the council, the BBC understands.
The council has cut budgets by Â£117m since 2011/12 with a further Â£41m savings due to be made by 2019.
The authority issued a legal notification of the redundancies last week to the unions, which are yet to comment on the move.
It is thought there is to be about 130 voluntary redundancies but it is not known which specific posts are to disappear.
Five commissioners have run the council since February after it was declared "not fit for purpose" in the wake of the child exploitation scandal.
They took control following the Casey Report's criticism of the council's response to child exploitation.
The town was the centre of an abuse ring and last year the Jay Report found 1,400 children had been subjected to abuse.
The commissioners are due to remain in control of Rotherham Council until the end of March 2019.

article The BBC understands the PM was warned she faced a leadership challenge unless she sacked Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill.
Labour said the pair had "taken the fall" for the prime minister.
Mrs May has announced that the new Downing Street chief of staff is ex-Conservative MP and former housing minister Gavin Barwell.
Mr Timothy said he took responsibility for his role in the "disappointing" result and the widely-criticised manifesto package on social care.
The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the pair's departure bought the PM some "breathing space" following 24 hours of recriminations after the Conservatives lost their overall majority.
He said the two were so close to the PM that critical MPs believed that, unless they made way, she would not be able to change her leadership style to adopt a more "outgoing, inclusive, responsive, empathetic approach".
Mrs May has said she intends to stay as prime minister and on Saturday evening it was announced her party's chief whip had agreed an outline deal "in principle" with the DUP of Northern Ireland, which would see the unionist party support the Tories on key votes.
Mr Timothy and Ms Hill both stepped down amid mounting pressure on Mrs May to overhaul the way No 10 worked and broaden her circle of advisers.
Announcing his resignation on the Conservative Home website, Mr Timothy urged Tory MPs to "get behind" Mrs May but said nothing should be allowed to get in the way of the process of forming a government and beginning Brexit talks.
He said the Conservatives' failure to win was not due to a lack of support for Theresa May and the Conservatives but due to an "unexpected surge" of support for Labour.
Who were the PM's special advisers?
Fiona Hill: Fiercely loyal and seen as a formidable operator, Fiona Hill was at Mrs May's side for four years at the Home Office, becoming a close confidante of the then home secretary. A former Sky News and Scotsman journalist in her 40s, she led work on the Modern Slavery Act and published her own report on the subject.
She was forced to resign as Mrs May's special adviser in a 2014 dispute with Michael Gove over who was to blame for briefing newspapers about an increase in extremism in schools. But she was brought back into the fold when Mrs May became PM.
Nick Timothy: The bearded Brummie is the son of a steelworker, who went to grammar school and joined the Conservative Party at the age of 17. He is credited with influencing the PM's views on social mobility and the need to put the Conservatives "at the service of working people".
His ambition to be a Conservative MP was reportedly thwarted by David Cameron, following a row over special advisers being asked to canvass in a by-election.
He conceded his party had failed to communicate a sufficiently "positive" message to voters and address their concerns over years of austerity and inter-generational divisions, including over Brexit.
"We were not talking to the people who decided to vote for Labour," he said.
He defended the party's "honest and strong" manifesto, saying controversial proposals to use the value of peoples' homes to fund domiciliary care costs had been discussed in government for months and were not his own personal "pet project".
But he added he took "responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy programme" and "I regret the decision not to include in the manifesto a ceiling as well as a floor in our proposal to help meet the increasing cost of social care".
Ms Hill said it had been a pleasure to serve in government and she believed Mrs May would continue as prime minister.
Norman Smith said he understood that senior Conservatives had warned the PM they would instigate a leadership contest at a meeting of backbenchers early next week if the pair did not leave, and were confident they could get the required 48 signatures to trigger a contest.
One former minister, Anna Soubry, welcomed the clearout, saying it was the "right thing to do" and saying the PM must "build a consensus" on Brexit and other issues.
But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the PM's advisers had "taken the fall" for her but tweeted the PM was "responsible for her own defeat".
Mr Barwell lost his Croydon Central seat on Thursday - which he won in 2015 with a majority of just 165 votes - to Labour's Sarah Jones, polling 24,221 votes to Ms Jones's 29,873.
He has written a book entitled How to Win a Marginal Seat: My Year Fighting For My Political Life.
He was appointed Minister for Housing and Minister for London in July 2016.
Earlier, Mrs May's director of communications until the election was announced, Katie Perrior, called the campaign "pretty dysfunctional", telling the BBC she "needed to have a few grey hairs in there who been around a bit and could say 'don't do that'".
As the Conservative leadership begins formal negotiations with the DUP, disquiet is being expressed in some quarters about the move.
Charles Tannock, a Conservative member of the European Parliament, said the DUP - which is opposed to same-sex marriage - was a "hardline, populist, protectionist" party and a "poor fit" as a partner.
The leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, has said there are "huge disagreements" between the two parties on gay and women's rights but she does not believe this will stand in the way of Theresa May being able to govern.
Ms Davidson, who is gay and plans to marry her partner in the near future, said she had received "categoric assurance" from Mrs May about the sanctity of LGBTI rights in Scotland where - unlike Northern Ireland - equal marriage is legal in the event of any deal with the DUP.
"What is important is that we try and help, where possible, to advance these rights in Northern Ireland while making sure there is absolutely no idea of any kind of roll back here. Those are the sort of assurances I sought and received".
Speaking on Friday, the prime minister said her party had a "strong relationship" with the DUP and that she intended to form a government which could "provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country".
Analysis by political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue
The clock is ticking for Theresa May. She needs to conclude a deal with the DUP in the next week or so ahead of the Queen's Speech, which will set out the new government's agenda.
That takes place on Monday 19 June - the same day Brexit negotiations are due to start.
The DUP and its 10 MPs are in a very strong position. It's all their Christmases rolled into one and they will make sure they leverage as much as they can from their advantage.
Money for Northern Ireland will undoubtedly be part of their demands, and Mrs May will expect that. But trickier will be any demands they have about the implementation of Brexit in Northern Ireland - in particular the DUP's determination to maintain a soft border with the south.
Another potential problem is the planned restart of negotiations for power-sharing in the province.
Typically the British government tries to act as an honest broker between Republicans and Unionists. But if Mrs May is doing a deal with the DUP, that could make it harder to reach an agreement with Sinn Fein.
DUP leader Arlene Foster confirmed she had spoken to Mrs May and that they would speak further to "explore how it may be possible to bring stability to this nation at this time of great challenge".
Mrs May is expected to continue assembling her top team later after she decided to keep key figures - including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris and Home Secretary Amber Rudd - in their current roles.
David Davis will also stay on as Brexit secretary and Sir Michael Fallon will keep his role as defence secretary.
There could be limited changes elsewhere in the cabinet while nine middle-ranking and junior ministers, including Ben Gummer and Jane Ellison, lost their seats at the general election and will need to be replaced.
Jeremy Corbyn has said Mrs May should "make way" for a government that would be "truly representative of the people of this country".
The Labour leader, who is expected to announce his shadow cabinet on Sunday, said his party was ready to form a minority government of its own, but stressed he would not enter into any "pacts or deals" with other parties.

Christian Ribeiro and Sam Long remain sidelined, although in-form Kane Hemmings is set to start.
Robyn Cowen: "Premier League survival remains the priority for Middlesbrough, so their increasingly tenuous position in the table might lessen their commitment to this fifth-round tie against Oxford United.
"Aitor Karanka's side should not underestimate their League One opponents. Oxford's form in cup competitions this season has been outstanding. As well as their FA Cup exploits, they're into the semi-final of the EFL Trophy and a late push for the play-offs is also in their sights.

Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka: "I always said that, for me, every competition is important. The FA Cup is an amazing trophy. We have to keep our belief and keep dreaming.
"Roberto [Martinez] won the title with Wigan and that shows it can be done. Our main aim is to stay in the Premier League this season, but for this week my priority is the cup.
"Our players are intelligent and know this is a good opportunity to go through. But to reach the next round we have to be at our best."
Oxford manager Michael Appleton: "We've beaten eight sides from a higher division, one of them a Premier League side. We give sides above us a really good game. We've got players that can play at that level. On a one-off, in a cup competition, they've proved they can do it.
"The cup competitions have been good to us. Some people see them as a distraction and they can be for some clubs, but we view it completely differently."
This is an absolute free hit for Oxford. I would love my old team to get through, but I fear this might be a hurdle too far.

The event, which is in its sixth year, sees participants swim 70m (230ft) from the Red Lion Hotel at Henley to the Leander Club at Remenham, Wokingham.
Organiser Beatrice Heller said the milder weather had attracted more swimmers than ever before.
"Five of us did it the first year when it was about minus eight and there was ice floating on the river," she said.
This year the "totally for fun" event saw a water temperature of 10C (50F), said Ms Heller.
"It was the biggest turn-out by far, the most we've had before is 23" she said.
"I think the warm weather made people think, 'oh yeah I'll give that a go'."

article The effort has ramped up since a key meeting in London five years ago.
In 2015, one billion people worldwide were treated for at least one tropical disease. Companies have donated seven billion treatments since 2012.
The World Health Organisation said improving water and sanitation was key to driving further progress.
The London meeting resulted in a pledge to control or eliminate 10 neglected tropical diseases - including guinea worm, river blindness and trachoma - by 2020.
Some 170,000 people die from one of the illnesses every year, but their biggest impact is disabling their sufferers.
In an interview with BBC News, Bill Gates praised pharmaceutical companies for "doing their part in a great relationship" by donating treatment at "a phenomenal scale".
Mr Gates said: "None of these diseases are getting worse. They are less neglected than they used to be.
"We're behind on some of the very ambitious goals which were set in London for 2020 - but the burden from all these diseases is getting better.
"And for some, such as lymphatic filariasis (a mosquito-borne worm which causes limbs to swell), there's been a big reduction in the population we need to treat - from 1.5 billion to one billion people.
"Guinea worm is close to the end, with only 25 cases last year - though the unrest in South Sudan is making this work harder. But it's not going to spread back in big numbers.
"And we've had huge progress on sleeping sickness (a parasitic infection which can kill) - with cases now down to under 3,000. This is a fantastic story.
"It's a hard area to explain because it's not just one disease - and there is a certain complexity to the individual diseases."
Five of the 10 diseases are tackled with big programmes to distribute multiple drugs, requiring lots of co-ordination to deliver and evaluate treatment in an efficient way.
Mr Gates was speaking from a meeting in Geneva, where new commitments worth $812m (Â£641m) have been made by governments, drug companies and charitable bodies.
He applauded the UK government's announcement at the weekend that it would double support for fighting neglected tropical diseases.
Mr Gates told me: "The UK is a critical donor. As somebody who's very measurement-oriented, I find that partnering with the UK on these health-related areas is a great way to spend money and lift these countries up.
"Anyone who gets to see these very tough diseases, and to see the benefit from these initiatives, would be absolutely convinced."
Mr Gates, who had a meeting with President Trump last month, described the recent US funding cut to the United Nations Population Fund as "disappointing and unfortunate".
He added: "I feel quite confident that when Congress decides the overall aid budget, there won't be the large cuts to foreign aid that would have been implied by the President's proposed budget.
"I don't know that we'll get to a situation where there are no cuts - but I think with the support of Congress, we'll get close to where we've been in previous years.
"I talked to the President about the critical role the US has played in the great progress on HIV, malaria and reproductive health - and in terms of how strong health systems can stop pandemics.
"We got a glimpse of that with Ebola and Zika.
"I think I was able to get across the idea that global health matters even in an 'America First' framework.
"The President has proved willing to be pragmatic since he's been in office - so continued dialogue about development aid will be important."

Mercedes have done more than a third more laps than any other team over three days at Spain's Circuit de Barcelona Catalunya, but Rosberg and Hamilton were only fifth and eighth fastest in the list of times on Wednesday.
They were in similar positions on the first two days.
Rosberg, 30, said Mercedes were mainly concentrating on reliability at this stage of testing.
"We need to push the car to its limit in order to find little problems," he said.
"At some point something will break and for now we need to keep on going to find out where the little weak points are.
"Lap time-wise, of course, it's not realistic where we are."
The fastest time of the day was set by Force India driver Nico Hulkenberg, who used the super-soft tyre to lap in one minute 23.110 seconds.
That is the second fastest time of the week, 0.2secs down on the lap Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel did on the new ultra-soft tyre on Tuesday.
It was also half a second quicker than Vettel managed on the super-soft on Tuesday.
Vettel handed the Ferrari over to team-mate Kimi Raikkonen on Wednesday and the Finn was third fastest, 2.8secs slower than Hulkenberg, using the medium tyre.
Second fastest, on soft tyres, was Romain Grosjean for the new US-based Haas team, who are entering F1 this season with significant support from Ferrari.
It was the continuation of an impressive debut for the team, whose other driver is Mexican Esteban Gutierrez.
Kevin Magnussen, who was drafted into the Renault team only last month after they dropped Pastor Maldonado, was fourth fastest, despite stopping out on track three times with reliability problems.
Jenson Button was 11th fastest in the McLaren-Honda, his running ended three hours early with a hydraulic leak that caused a fire.
He was ahead only of novice Rio Haryanto, the Indonesian spinning at turn five on his first day driving an F1 car.
Headline lap times from pre-season testing are notoriously poor indicators of real form.

article They were young, no older than 35. Their family home had been hit by an air strike, they said, one of thousands launched by a Saudi-led coalition that pounded the province every day that month.
The heartland of the rebel Houthi movement, Saada is among the most dangerous parts of Yemen, and the Al-Jumhori is the only emergency facility in the province — in reality, the only A&E department in most of northern Yemen.
Dr Carrara, an Argentine working for the international medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), triaged the married couple. The husband's injuries were minor and she turned her attention to the wife, who had severe injuries to both her arms. Nearly all the soft tissue had been stripped away by the blast.
As a surgical team prepared to amputate, Dr Carrara spoke to the woman's husband. He asked her to save his wife's arms. Their four children, all younger than 10, had been killed by the strike, he told her.
"We have lost our children," he said. "Please do everything you can."
Since March, when the US-backed coalition launched a military campaign to defeat the Houthis, some 6,000 people — almost half of them civilians — have been killed in air strikes and fighting on the ground in Yemen, according to the UN.
In January, a leaked UN report accused the coalition of "widespread and systematic" attacks against civilians. The coalition says it greatly regrets civilian deaths, which it insists are unintentional.
The coalition is attempting to restore the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who was forced into exile by the rebels last March, but the conflict has taken a bloody toll on the country's civilians and ravaged an already fragile health system.
Three MSF facilities and one ambulance have been hit by air strikes, killing at least eight people and depriving hundreds of thousands of access to emergency care — despite the charity providing their co-ordinates to all sides.
With precious few A&E facilities left functioning, Al-Jumhori has expanded from a small facility into a 93-bed hospital treating 2,000 emergency cases a month and performing more than 100 surgeries a week.
"I'd never before seen the level of casualties I saw in Saada," Michael Seawright, an MSF project coordinator, said in January after a stint in the province.
"The scale of wounded was extreme in two respects - firstly there was a large number of wounded coming through the hospital, but second the severity of wounds was also often extreme."
And the bombs have other crippling effects, beyond their blast radius. They discourage many casualties from even attempting to reach a facility, said Teresa Sancristobal, MSF's emergency co-ordinator for Yemen.
"The perception is that the medical facilities are not safe. A lot of times when we ask patients why they didn't come sooner, they tell us they were afraid," she said.
For Yemen's civilians, getting to a medical facility equipped to cope with severe trauma can be hellishly difficult. It can involve an hours-long journey by car, fraught with danger from flying bullets and falling missiles.
On Thursday, a young pregnant woman arrived at Al-Jumhori with 60% of her body burned. Like so many who come through the hospital's doors, her home had been hit by an air strike, this one in the heavily-targeted Razeh district of Saada province, close to the border with Saudi Arabia.
With travel too risky, the woman was forced to wait for a week before her family could take her to a nearby clinic. From there she was moved by ambulance to the Al-Jumhori, a five-hour journey.
"I could not imagine how much pain she was in," said Dr Carrara. "By the time she reached us she was septic and had severe organ failure. We did what we could but there was no hope." The woman died 16 hours later. She was in her 20s.
If she had made it to Saada city within eight hours, she and her child could almost certainly have been saved.
Patients arriving at MSF facilities in Yemen are immediately graded with one of four colours: green denotes that they are walking wounded; yellow that they must be seen within an hour; red that they need immediate resuscitation; black that they are already dead, or have no hope.
"We grade a lot of people black and red," said Dr Carrara. "Most of them are young. They have crash injuries, vascular injuries, fractures, open fractures on the legs and arms, head trauma, penetrating head trauma, abdominal trauma, chest trauma, open chest trauma, blunt trauma.
"Air strikes cause multiple, severe injuries. They put people in critical condition."
The first day we spoke, a family of seven was rushed in to Dr Carrara's A&E. Five — the mother, father, and three children — were immediately graded black. Two boys were alive. The older of the two, aged 20, was graded green — he would survive. The younger boy, aged just eight, was graded red. He had a penetrating head trauma and was in a coma.
When we spoke again the following day, the boy's condition had deteriorated. He will probably die.
Emergencies are not the difficult part of treating the war-wounded, said Dr Carrara. The difficulty comes later, as she follows them through their recovery — "sometimes 10 days, sometimes a month, sometimes more".
"That is when you hear their stories, what happened to them, who they lost. That's when I wonder how they can continue. And that's when it gets difficult." At what point does it become too much? "It doesn't," she said. "You do what you have to. You do the work, that gets you through."
An average day for an MSF doctor in Yemen would be too much for most. Last year, while Saada city was being bombed daily, the medical team at Al-Jumhori — a mix of MSF staff and Yemenis — were working 16-hour days and snatching naps on a handful of shared mattresses in the basement, the risk of leaving the hospital too great.
Dr Carrara's few hours downstairs were usually interrupted by emergency calls, up to four or five per night. The warning system for an emergency is often primitive: the hospital's doors and windows vibrate. A bomb has landed nearby.
"When you feel the ground shake, you know that patients are coming," she said.
In January, a missile hit the Shiara emergency room, an MSF facility in nearby Razeh district. Six people, including three members of the medical staff, were killed and seven more severely injured. The hospital was destroyed.
MSF says it does everything in its power to identify its staff and facilities to Yemen's warring factions, but there is only so much it can do.
"The situation is very difficult, the insecurity is clear," Ms Sancristobal said. "Hospitals have to be a place where patients feel safe. We don't understand how we could have had so many attacks."
The coalition promised in January to conduct a review into the strikes on MSF facilities and set up a "hotline" with the charity. Ms Sancristobal said she did not know what the coalition meant by "hotline" — MSF has been communicating its positions since the beginning of the conflict.
"The communication is good, the results are bad," she said.
In Syria, where two hospitals suffered direct air strikes last week, MSF has been forced to take a startling and opposite tack: withholding the GPS co-ordinates of its facilities from the Syrian and Russian militaries over fears they are being deliberately targeted.
Dr Carrara is preparing to leave Yemen. In Saada city, things are beginning to improve — it is safe enough for the medical staff to live in a house opposite the hospital, although they still do not go out, only shuttle between the two buildings.
The hospital is open again for inpatients, meaning people with chronic illnesses can again seek treatment. Women are delivering babies on the wards again, every day, and staying the night.
It does not take Dr Carrara long to recall the moment that meant the most to her. One morning last October, shortly after returning to Yemen, she arrived for her shift and noticed a woman sitting quietly in the waiting area, her face covered by a veil.
She asked a nurse what the woman was waiting for. "She's waiting for you," the nurse replied. It was the woman whose arms had been so badly wounded in May, whose four young children had died.
Just as her husband had asked, the hospital staff had done everything they could — a massive operation to close her wounds, months of dressing her arms every day under sedation because the pain was so intense. And on top of all that, treatment for the malaria she contracted during her recovery.
"What stayed with me was that she had never once complained, never," Dr Carrara said. "This woman who lost her four children, she didn't complain when she arrived, she didn't complain when she was treated, she didn't complain during her recovery. Her bravery... I couldn't understand how."
That morning, in the waiting area at the hospital, she was alive and well. She had lost three fingers but only a small amount of movement in her arms. She was managing her daily activities, she said. She was coping. It was more than the doctors who had stood with her on the same spot six months before could have hoped.
Dr Carrara has an understated way of describing things — perhaps it is just the effort of using a second language — but her voice thickens a little with emotion as she remembers.
"It was difficult to talk, I don't speak Arabic. The nurse translated for us. She had come to say thank-you. It was nice. It was so nice."

World number 31 Davis looked to be heading out as O'Sullivan established a commanding lead in the best-of-seven contest.
Davis took the next four frames to complete a remarkable comeback on a day of shocks at the tournament.
Lee Walker pulled off a surprise as he came from 3-1 down to beat world number seven Neil Robertson 4-3.
Former world champion and 2016 finalist Robertson made 143 - the highest break of the tournament - on the way to a two-frame lead before Walker came back.
The Welshman, ranked 94, won the next three straight frames to seal victory.
Meanwhile, 15-year-old Welsh schoolboy Jackson Page reached the last 32 with a 4-3 win against John Astley.
It is the teenage amateur's second win in the tournament after beating Jason Weston 4-3 in round one.
Page will now play world number four Judd Trump, who edged past Malta's Alex Borg 4-2.
Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's Mark Allen eased past Thailand's Boonyarit Keattikun 4-1, Ross Muir thrashed Marco Fu 4-0 while Anthony Hamilton beat Jamie Cope 4-1 to set up a third-round tie against Craig Steadman, who defeated Sam Baird.

article Mr Arreak lives in Pond Inlet, Nunavut, a mostly Inuit hamlet on the northern tip of Baffin Island near the eastern entrance of the Northwest Passage.
He's the research coordinator for the sea-ice monitoring and real-time information for coastal environments (SmartICE) project, which uses technology, remote sensing, and Inuit knowledge to monitor the state of sea ice in northern Labrador.
The sea ice is used by the Inuit as a winter ice highway for regional travel, hunting and trapping.
"During the winter, some areas are getting unpredictable to travel on," Mr Arreak told the BBC over the phone from Pond Inlet.
It's estimated that the region has lost 73% of its sea ice cover over the last 40 years.
On Wednesday, some 1,865 miles (3,000km) south of Pond Inlet in Ottawa, where the impacts of climate change is not being felt as immediately as in the Arctic, Canadian legislators voted to approve the Paris global climate agreement.
The 207-81 vote helped the Paris agreement reach the threshold of being ratified by 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions. It will now come into force globally on 4 November, 30 days after meeting that ratification threshold.
US President Barack Obama marked that occasion in a statement outside the White House on Wednesday.
"This is an historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations,'' he said.
Canada's ratification of the accord follows on the heels of the successful European Parliament vote earlier this week. Major polluters Unites States and China ratified the accord in September.
The Paris deal aims to limit those emissions and keep global temperature increases "well below" 2C.
Canada produces just under 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. The US produces about 18%, China 20%. The UK contributes 1.5%.
As part of Canada's efforts to meet its climate targets under the Paris accord, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday the federal government would set a minimum national price on carbon starting at CA$10 ($7.5/Â£6) per tonne in 2018 and increasing to CA$50 ($38/Â£30) per tonne in 2022 -  a floor price all 10 provinces and three territories would have to meet.
Provinces will be given the choice on how to implement the tax on carbon emissions.
Over 80% of Canadians already live in jurisdictions with some type of carbon pricing or cap-and-trade plan in place or in the works, including the heavily populated provinces of Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia.
Still, the plan received strong pushback from a number of provincial leaders, including Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who criticised Mr Trudeau's unilateral announcement in the House of Commons as a "betrayal" and Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil, who said he wouldn't implement the federal plan.
The opposition federal Conservatives have also been critical of Mr Trudeau's policies to meet Canada's international obligations and MPs voted against the Paris deal's ratification.
"We don't believe he has a plan, we just believe he's going to tax Canadians heavily," said federal Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose.
Environmental groups however, are calling the national price on carbon good first step.
Mark Cameron, executive director for Canadians for Clean Prosperity, an advocacy organisation that pushes for economic and environmental sustainability, said it sets Canada "on the right path" but will take more efforts to meet the targets.
Canada has made a commitment to reducing its emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, in line with the former Conservative government's target.
"A lot of people suggest that's a weak target, I don't think that's the case," Mr Cameron said.
"I think it's actually quite a difficult target given Canada's type of economy, a natural resource economy."
Canada ranks among the world's top 10 energy producers.
Catherine Abreu, executive director of Climate Action Network Canada, argues the country needs to move away from developing those oil and gas reserves in order to meet its commitments.
"We're still locked into a story in Canada that prosperity means pollution," she said, pointing to Mr Trudeau's recent approval - with conditions - of the construction of a Pacific NorthWest LNG project, a major liquefied natural gas terminal on the country's west coast.
She also noted many federal promises "are still locked up in the consultation stage".
Between 1948 and 2013, Canada's annual average temperature increased by 1.6C, a higher rate than most other regions in the world, according to federal government data.
While the trend is seen consistently across the country, the strongest effects have been observed in the Arctic, something Mr Arreak said people in his community can testify to.
Many have lost confidence in the safety of traditional sea ice trails used for centuries and are relying on his work with SmartICE to keep them safe.
"I love being out there on the ice," Mr Arreak said.
"It's our main highway, it's where we go to our camping areas, our harvesting areas, a family gathering place for us. I just want people to stay safe, travel safe around the ice and to come home safely."

article Dubbed the two sessions, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which is the country's top national advisory body, opened on Tuesday, and the meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC), the top legislative body, will begin on Thursday.
The sessions, attended by thousands of officials and business leaders, will discuss various issues, including the economic reforms process and this year's targets.
"It is also an opportunity for the world to watch the oriental country," says the Xinhua News Agency.
The agency points out that top officials will unveil the country's 2015 GDP growth target and the defence budget.
It adds that the sessions will also shed light on how Chinese lawmakers respond to regional territorial disputes and other global issues, including the Ukraine crisis and Korean peninsula issue.
The People's Daily says the Tuesday meeting is an important platform for "democratic expressions" as "representatives of the people" come together to provide suggestions to issues concerning the people.
"Democracy is not an ornament, it is not used for display... we must insist that we remain united. This is the most important essence of political consultative democracy," says the front-page editorial.
Another commentary in the daily adds that the "two sessions" will "fully exhibit to the world a form of democracy with 'Chinese characteristics' and will "contribute to the development of political and civilisation of mankind with Chinese wisdom".
According to the Global Times, a total of 945 proposals and ideas were submitted on Monday.
Xu Yaotong, a professor with the Chinese Academy of Governance, tells the paper that the members of the CPPCC "are becoming more active in drafting proposals and participating in social and political affairs".
"The role of the CPPCC has been emphasised by the government and the members' proposals have received more attention," says the pundit.
Meanwhile, papers also shine a spotlight on the government's anti-corruption efforts.
An opinion piece in the Beijing Times anticipates that the fight against corruption will continue to be one of the main themes of the meetings.
Echoing similar views, the Beijing News describes the upcoming meetings as "a cleaner one" because several corrupt officials have been arrested or suspended since last year.
And finally, papers warn protesters in Hong Kong against promoting "separatist agenda" after clashes broke out on Sunday in a suburban town near the border with China.
The protesters were angry with the so-called parallel traders from China for exploiting visa rules to buy goods in Hong Kong to sell at a profit across the border.
The China Daily says the protesters were seeking independence for Hong Kong "under the guise" of the protests against the traders.
"These moves, apparently designed to foster hatred between locals and mainland residents, appear to be part of a separatist agenda promoting the illusionary idea of 'Hong Kong's independence'," notes the editorial.
However, it states that such an attempt will be "futile" as it will "only lead the city to a political and economic dead-end".
Noting that the "anti-parallel trading" protests have turned into an anti-mainlanders campaign, the overseas edition of the People's Daily warns that Hong Kong will face "long-term economic consequences" if the city continues to display hostility towards mainland tourists.

article European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) says it is working with the Ligue Nationale de Rugby, Premiership Rugby and the Pro12 to reschedule the ties.
"An announcement regarding the new dates will be made as soon as possible," read an EPCR statement.
Sunday's match between Stade Francais and Munster has also been postponed.
All round one pool games scheduled to be held in France last weekend, including Bath's trip to Toulon, Ulster's visit to Oyonnax and Racing 92's home game against Glasgow Warriors, were called off.
Pau's home game against Castres in the Challenge Cup was also postponed and will be rearranged.
Bath first-team coach Toby Booth said the Premiership side were keen to take on Toulon, the reigning European champions.
"We are desperate to play it and we are looking forward to pitching ourselves against the best in Europe," Booth told BBC Radio Bristol.
"It is very tough, as we know, to rejig things in such a congested schedule but I am sure we will come to some sort of conclusion."
Bath will belatedly start their Champions Cup campaign at home to Leinster in pool five on Saturday.
Booth said he was hopeful his players will feel reinvigorated after two weeks without a match since beating London Irish 45-14 in the Premiership.
"We have recruited a squad of high quality which we want to keep physically fresh," he added.
"The attrition rate in the Premiership is massive, so you need to do your best to maintain an output."

article Ex-Wales Tourist Board chief executive Jonathan Jones told BBC Wales the way business rates are calculated for self-catering holiday homes must change.
The owner of a complex of holiday cottages in Pembrokeshire cut his rates from over £5,000 to zero by appealing.
Jan Meulendijk said the business would have closed if he had lost the appeal.
Mr Meulendijk runs Rosemoor Holiday Cottages and Nature Reserve in Walwyn's Castle.
Businesses pay a percentage of what is known as a rateable value in business rates, and those rates are set every five years.
In 2010, the rateable value for Rosemore more than doubled to £13,000.
"Paying the rates was actually slowly beginning to kill the business," Mr Meulendijk said.
"Had we been forced to keep paying them we would have been forced to go under - it was more than the business could sustain."
The rateable value of his business was re-set at £6,000 and, as firms receive rate relief on rateable values of £6,000 or under, it means he no longer pays the tax, saving more than £5,000 a year.
Mr Jones, now working as a tourism consultant, appeared as an expert witness for Mr Meulendijk at his appeal and believes the result could have consequences for hundreds of other holiday property owners.
"What you need is a system whereby self catering businesses pay fair business rates," he said.
"I don't think anyone is talking that they don't pay business rates - they are running a business but it should be fair in relation to the contribution they make to the economy and to their business model."
The Valuation Office Agency, which sets rateable values for non-domestic property, said it was "content" that its approach was correct.
It said in a statement: "A decision on a particular property does not necessarily mean that the valuations of others require amendment.
"If someone feels our assessment may not be accurate, we would encourage them to discuss their circumstances with us - this is free of charge."

article The Premiership leaders have announced pre-season dates with the Serie A team, Leicester City and Barcelona.
The match against Inter on 13 August will celebrate the 50th anniversary season of Celtic's 1967 European Cup triumph against the Italians.

article Grammar schools are state secondary schools that select their pupils by means of an examination taken by children at age 11, known as the "11-plus".
There are only about 163 grammar schools in England, out of some 3,000 state secondaries, and a further 69 grammar schools in Northern Ireland.
Under the grammar school system, pupils who pass the exam can go to the local grammar, while those who do not go to the local "secondary modern school".
More common across the UK is the "comprehensive" system, in which pupils of all abilities and aptitudes are taught together.
There are no state grammars in Wales or Scotland, and although some retain the name "grammar school", they are non-selective and have no special status.
Grammar schools have existed since the 16th Century, but the modern grammar school concept dates back to the Education Act 1944. This made secondary education after the age of 14 free.
At the same time secondary education was reorganised into two basic types:
There was a third type of school, the technical school - but very few were established.
So the system effectively divided pupils into two types - those destined for university and better jobs, and those deemed more suitable for less celebrated professions.
During the 1950s and 1960s, it was said, mainly by Labour politicians and egalitarian educationalists, that the selective education system reinforced class division and middle-class privilege.
In 1965, the government ordered local education authorities to start phasing out grammar schools and secondary moderns, and replace them with a comprehensive system.
The quickest changes were made in Labour-controlled areas, while strongly Conservative counties moved slowly or not at all.
A handful of counties and local authorities in England have kept largely selective schools systems, including Kent, Medway, Buckinghamshire and Lincolnshire, while others such as Gloucestershire, Trafford and Slough have a mix.
In other places, a few grammar schools survived in areas that were otherwise fully comprehensive, such as Birmingham, Bournemouth and some London boroughs.
In 1998, Labour's School Standards and Framework Act forbade the establishment of any new all-selective schools.
It also made provisions for local ballots on the future of existing grammar schools.
Only one such ballot has taken place since then. In 2000, parents in Ripon, North Yorkshire, voted by 67% to 33% in favour of keeping Ripon Grammar as a grammar school.
Grammar schools select their pupils by means of a test, known as the 11-plus, which is taken by pupils in the last year of primary school.
It is designed to see if they are able enough to learn in a grammar school environment with peers of a similar standard.
But many complain about the nature of the test, as it often features types of questions not usually adopted in regular state primaries.
Grammar school entrance exams can consist of all or a subset of the following:
•         Numerical reasoning (maths)
•         Verbal reasoning
•         English comprehension, punctuation and grammar
•         Non-verbal reasoning
•         Creative writing
They have traditionally used questions based on verbal reasoning and non-verbal reasoning, and it is argued that those who have been intensively tutored tend to do much better in these tests.
Recently there have been attempts to make the tests more accessible and closer to the kind of word problems children face in primary schools.
Some grammar schools admit successful students by ranked order - all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score - literally creaming the best pupils off the top.
In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school or whether they already have a sibling there.
There are numerous companies that offer specialist 11-plus tutoring to children from an early age.
Some examples of 11-plus questions (Answers at foot of page)

Labour oppose the creation of more grammar schools saying that instead of improving equality, they make it worse.
The Conservatives Party support for grammar schools was lukewarm under previous Prime Minister David Cameron, but its manifesto states it will allow all good schools to expand "whether they are maintained schools, academies, free schools or grammar schools".
The Liberal Democrats would maintain the status quo, not opening any more or closing any existing ones.

article The Ivorian told French sports magazine L'Equipe on Tuesday he felt he had been unfairly criticised and is not happy.
"I don't have to answer for how happy Yaya is at the club," said Pellegrini.
"The answer is his performances over the last four years. He is a very important player and he demonstrates it every game."
Toure told L'Equipe that winning trophies and earning a lot of money had not made him any happier as he felt sickened by "lots of bitter people who tried to dirty my name".
The 32-year-old midfielder also expressed his disgust at those who have been quick to criticise his performances and admitted to being hurt by what he felt was a lack of recognition.
The Ivory Coast captain, who has won the Premier League twice with City, has scored one goal in 11 appearances this season.
"He may have a few concerns about the criticism but that is different to being unhappy at the club," Pellegrini added.

article "That's why I can't go... they couldn't protect me from those laws," Sir Ian, 74, told the Radio Times.
"Two and a half hours from London! In the land of Tchaikovsky, Diaghilev, Rudolf Nureyev - gay artists whose sexuality informed their work."
The actor came out as being gay at the age of 49.
Russia passed a law in June which can result in heavy fines for anyone providing information about homosexuality to people under 18.
Critics say its loose interpretation effectively hinders any kind of public gay rights event in Russia.
Sir Ian also hit back at comments made by Homeland star Damian Lewis in a Guardian interview earlier this year.
Lewis said he did not want to end up "as one of those slightly over-the-top, fruity actors who would have an illustrious career on stage, but wouldn't start getting any kind of film work until I was 50 and then start playing wizards".
While not naming names, the comments were widely thought to have been aimed at actors like Sir Ian, who played the wizard Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films, and Michael Gambon, who played Professor Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise.
Sir Ian told the magazine: "So he feels sorry for me, does he? Well, I'm very happy, he needn't worry about me", although he did agree Lewis's remark was "fair comment".
However, he went on to say: "To rebut it, I wouldn't like to have been one of those actors who hit stardom quite early on and expected it to continue and was stuck doing scripts that I didn't particularly like just to keep the income up.
"I've always wanted to get better as an actor. And I have got better. You've only got to see my early work to see that."
Regarding the "fruity voice" comment, Sir Ian said: "Well, it may be a voice that is trained like an opera singer's voice: to fill a large space. It is unnatural."
He added: "To be allowed for the first time in your later career to play leading parts in extremely popular movies is not a situation to worry about."
Sir Ian also admitted his performance in ITV show Vicious was "over the top" and he would tone it down for the second series.
He said he was over acting for the benefit of the live studio audience.

article The Airbus A-321 had just left the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, bound for the Russian city of St Petersburg.
Wreckage was found in the Hasana area and bodies removed, along with the plane's "black box".  An official described a "tragic scene" with bodies of victims still strapped to seats.
Egypt's prime minister said no "irregular" activities were to blame.
Sinai has an active militant network, and on Saturday afternoon, jihadis allied to the so-called Islamic State made a claim on social media that they brought down flight KGL9268.
But Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov told Interfax news agency that "such reports cannot be considered true". No evidence had been seen that indicated the plane was targeted, he said.
Egypt's civilian aviation ministry said the plane had been at an altitude of 9,450m (31,000ft) when it disappeared.
Security experts say a plane flying at that altitude would be beyond the range of a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile (Manpad), which Sinai militants are known to possess.
But the German carrier Lufthansa said it would avoid flying over Sinai "as long as the cause for today's crash has not been clarified". On Saturday evening, Air France said it was following suit.
British Airways and easyJet said their routes were regularly reviewed, but that they had no plans to alter their routes to and from Sharm el-Sheikh.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared Sunday a day of mourning.
He has ordered an official investigation into the crash of the flight, and for rescue teams to be sent to the crash site.
Egyptian officials said 214 of the passengers were Russian and three Ukrainian.
Russian authorities say the plane was carrying 217 passengers, 17 of them children aged between 2 and 17. Most were tourists. There were seven crew on board.
A commission headed by Mr Sokolov left for Egypt on Saturday afternoon.
A criminal case had been opened against the airline, Kogalymavia, for "violation of rules of flight and preparation for them", Russia's Ria news agency reported.
Yulia Zaitseva said her friends, newlyweds Elena Rodina and Alexander Krotov, were on board.
"We were friends for 20 years," she told AP at a hotel where relatives were meeting near Pulkovo airport in St Petersburg.
"To lose such a friend is like having your hand cut off."
05:58 Egyptian time (03:58 GMT): flight leaves Sharm el-Sheikh, the Egyptian cabinet says in a statement
06:14 Egyptian time (04:14 GMT): plane fails to make scheduled contact with air traffic control based in Larnaca, Cyprus, according to Sergei Izdolsky, an official with Russia's air transport agency.
06:17 Egyptian time, approx (04:17 GMT): plane comes down over the Sinai peninsula, according to Airbus
11:12 Egyptian time (09:12 GMT): flight had been due to land in St Petersburg's Pulkovo airport
Oksana Golovin, a spokeswoman for Kogalymavia, said the company did not see any grounds to blame human error.
She told a press conference that the pilot had 12,000 hours of flying experience. Kogalymavia did not yet know what caused the crash, she said, but the plane was fully serviced.
Police are reported to be searching the company's offices.
Initially there were conflicting reports about the fate of the plane, some suggesting it had disappeared over Cyprus.
But the office of Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail confirmed in a statement that a "Russian civilian plane... crashed in the central Sinai".
Officials say up to 50 ambulances have been sent to the scene. Access to the area is strictly controlled by the military.
One official told Reuters news agency that at least 100 bodies had been found.
"I now see a tragic scene," the official said. "A lot of dead on the ground and many died whilst strapped to their seats."
The plane split in two, with one part burning up and the other crashing into a rock, he added.
Live flight tracking service Flight Radar 24's Mikail Robertson told the BBC that the plane started to drop very fast, losing 1,500 metres in one minute before coverage was lost.
Egyptian aviation official Ayman al-Mukadem said the pilot had reported technical difficulties before the plane went missing, the Associated Press reported.
Local weather observations in the vicinity of the rescue scene suggest relatively benign conditions.
summary A Russian plane has crashed in the Arabian Gulf, killing all 157 people on board.

article Stones, 21, produced an accomplished performance as Everton drew 0-0 with Tottenham at White Hart Lane.
The centre-back did so on the back of intense scrutiny about his future after a transfer request was rejected.
"He was under a lot of pressure, so his performance was that of someone who has the potential to become an England captain," Martinez said.
Media playback is not supported on this device
"He shows incredible composure and you would never say he's only 21 years old."
Martinez reiterated Everton's stance that Stones is not for sale after Chelsea had three bids refused and claims the player "accepts" the club's position.
He added: "Absolutely he accepts he is an Everton player. We want to be a winning team and John is a big part of that.
"We have our own ambitions and project and John is a big part of that. He showed a really strong face against Tottenham."
Everton midfielder Tom Cleverley and Tottenham's Mousa Dembele were both taken off on stretchers at White Hart Lane.
Cleverley, 26, was injured in a first-half challenge with Spurs' Eric Dier and Martinez admitted that at first he had feared the worst.
"We'll assess him over the next 24 hours," said the Everton boss. "Straight away we thought it was ligament damage plus something else.
"It was a big worry, but we feel quite confident now that it was just ligament damage. It was a really strong challenge and it shows how fit he is to escape that incident with just ligament damage."
Dembele, 28, suffered a self-inflicted injury, his right boot appearing to clip his left Achilles after passing the ball. An update on his injury is expected on Monday.

article In a TV interview on Sunday, Mahfouz Saber said judges were "lofty and have status" and had to come from "a respectable milieu".
The son a rubbish collector "would get depressed and would not continue" if he was appointed a judge, Mr Saber warned.
Thousands of people took to social media to express anger at his comments.
In those few words, Mr Saber encapsulated the system of patronage and privilege that brought so many Egyptians onto the streets back in 2011 to bring down Hosni Mubarak and the status quo, says the BBC's World Service Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher.
His dismissal is a small victory for Egyptian liberals but also a bitter reminder for them of how little the system has changed, he adds.
Mahfouz Saber faced a storm of criticism on social media, as well as demands for his resignation.
"#Egypt's Minister of Justice says sons of garbage collectors cannot become judges. Yet another proof that justice in Egypt is just a farce," wrote blogger Mina Fayek on Twitter.
Former Vice-President Mohamed ElBaradei meanwhile noted that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has "the right to equal access to public service in his country".
"When the concept of justice is absent from a country, nothing remains," he added.
Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said in a statement that Mr Saber had resigned out of "respect for public opinion".
The minister was quoted in the same statement as saying that the remarks had been "a slip of the tongue".
In Cairo, a large Coptic Christian community of garbage collectors known as Zabbaleen (Egyptian Arabic for "rubbish people") collects by hand and sorts for recycling almost two-thirds of the 15,000 tonnes of rubbish thrown away by the capital's 18 million inhabitants.
Egypt's constitution prohibits discrimination based on class or gender.
However, the AFP news agency says the public prosecution turned down 138 applicants for jobs last year because their fathers did not have university degrees.

article With 85% of the votes in, the ANC trails its main rival, the Democratic Alliance, in the cities of Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.
The two parties are in a close fight in Johannesburg and Pretoria.
But the ANC is still in the lead nationally.
Unemployment and corruption scandals surrounding President Jacob Zuma have tarnished the ANC's image.
Election results as they happened
"The ANC failed to enthuse their voters and give them a credible offer and that is what often happens to parties that have mismanaged the economy, mismanaged the city, but it also says that we are growing as a party," Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane told the BBC.
"We've been able to make an offer before South Africans that is compelling."
Mr Maimane earlier told 702 radio: "We call this the change election because we felt that it was a referendum on Jacob Zuma as a national figure, but we also had a referendum about the future of South Africa."
Final results are expected on Friday.
The municipal election result is probably the biggest wake-up call the governing African National Congress has received since it ushered in democracy in South Africa in 1994.
Clearly the ANC still commands huge support across the country but that support is waning. It can no longer take it for granted that the black majority will blindly follow it.
Its power and influence is in decline.
In-fighting, public squabbles and a host of corruption scandals have been slowly eating away at the reputation of a once glorious movement of the people.
The best example is in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality where the ANC is lagging behind in a city (Port Elizabeth) which has a rich history of anti-apartheid struggle. The man poised to be the new mayor is the Democratic Alliance's Athol Trollip, who is white.
Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, black people are now voting on issues and not on race. Mr Trollip, who speaks fluent Xhosa, would not be where he is if the vast majority of black people had not voted for him.
The ANC has won more than 60% of the vote at every election since the end of apartheid more than two decades ago.
With two-thirds of the votes counted on Thursday, the ANC had 53%, followed by 28% for the Democratic Alliance and 7% for the radical Economic Freedom Fighters.
The local elections are being seen as an indication of the mid-term popularity of President Zuma. Correspondents say a poor ANC performance could embolden Mr Zuma's rivals within the party to challenge him.
The next general elections are due in 2019 but Mr Zuma cannot stand for a third term as president.
South Africa's economy has also been one of the main issues for voters, with growth expected to be zero this year, and unemployment standing at 27%.
Protests demanding better housing and amenities have sprung up across South Africa.
Mr Zuma has also had to weather a corruption scandal, after being ordered to repay taxpayers' money spent on his private home.
Security was tight for the elections and the electoral commission said voting had passed off smoothly.

"This is the best way to protect the achievement, reputation and integrity of NICEM," he said.
In the letter, he said that while NICEM had "several outstanding funding applications" it was "unable to sustain a sufficient cash flow".
He said the council would be dissolved after a general meeting on 7 November.
He added his thanks to those who had joined "our anti-racist movement".
"Despite this set back, the vision and values of NICEM will continue as well as the anti-racism movement in Northern Ireland."

article Mr Bell, 79, from Ramoan Gardens in west Belfast is charged with two counts of soliciting the murder of Mrs McConville in 1972.
The IRA kidnapped 37-year-old Mrs McConville in front of her children at her home in the Divis flats.
When asked if he had any reply to the two charges he said "no".
He was asked if he wanted to call witnesses, and again he said "no".
The district judge said that following a two-day preliminary hearing last week she was satisfied that the standard proof had been met and there was sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial.
Six of Jean McConville's children were in the court to hear the decision.  None of them wanted to speak after the hearing.
Ivor Bell was released on continuing bail. His bail conditions were amended, and he must now report to police once a week rather than twice.

article The law allows the authorities to prosecute foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or firms designated as "undesirable" on national security grounds.
Individuals working for NGOs could face fines or up to six years in prison.
Critics say it is a Kremlin move aimed at stifling dissent.
The definition of "undesirable" is open to interpretation, but the Interfax news agency said it would apply to organisations deemed to pose a threat to the "foundations of Russia's constitutional order, defensive capacity and security".
NGOs linked to politics in Russia already face restrictions under a 2012 law requiring them to register as "foreign agents".
Supporters of the new bill say it is essential to prevent Russia from outside interference, amid ongoing tensions due to Russia's involvement in Ukraine.
But there was concern from Western governments and NGOs about the implications.
The US state department said it was "deeply troubled" by the law.
"We are concerned this new power will further restrict the work of civil society in Russia and is a further example of the Russian government's growing crackdown on independent voices and intentional steps to isolate the Russian people from the world," spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.
Britain's Minister for Europe, David Lidington, said it was "yet another example of the Russian authorities' harassment of NGOs and those who work with them in Russia".
Amnesty International said the bill would "squeeze the life" from civil society, while Human Rights Watch (HRW) warned it would be locals who would be worst-hit.
"We are often asked - is this draft law aimed against international rights groups like yours?" said Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia Director.
"But in fact, there is little doubt that its primary targets are Russian activists and Russian independent organisations."

article Coetzee, 52, coached Stormers and Western Province in the Super 14, before a brief stint with Japanese side Kobe Steel Kobelco Steelers.
He succeeds Heyneke Meyer, who resigned in December after leading the Springboks to third place at last year's World Cup.
"I am very excited and grateful for this opportunity," Coetzee said.
"This job comes with a huge amount of responsibility because our passionate fans rightfully demand the best from the Springboks at all times."
Coetzee was part of the Springbok coaching team in 2000 and, most notably, between 2004 and 2007, including during their World Cup triumph in France.
"Allister's appointment marks the changing of the guard at the top of Springbok rugby," South Africa Rugby president Oregan Hoskins said.
"He was the outstanding candidate in terms of his rugby credentials, his understanding of our unique South African transformation imperatives and also in the image he will present as Springbok coach."

article Dempsey Nibbs, 69, killed Judith Nibbs, his partner of 30 years, after he became angry when she admitted to having affairs.
The crane driver, from the Charles Estate in Hoxton, must serve a minimum of 21 years.
Ms Nibbs was attacked with an iron bar in April 2014, the Old Bailey heard.
More on this story and other news from London
Nibbs, who has prostate cancer, claimed he had acted in self defence and that he thought Ms Nibbs was a "snake" - but jurors heard he had shown no sign of mental illness.
The Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC told him: "I'm sure you don't regret your wife's death save for its effect on your own comfort and well-being."
Defence lawyer Ian Henderson QC told the court that Nibbs acknowledged that his ill health meant he would die in jail.
Nibbs attacked the mother of his two children after she had taunted him that she had had affairs.
After knocking her unconscious with the iron bar, he then cut off her head before attacking it with a mallet.
He then wrote a note to his son and called 999 to say two bodies would be found at the property.
When police arrived, Nibbs was attempting to stab himself. Officers broke the door down before grappling with Nibbs who was armed with a shotgun and knife.
Jurors heard that their relationship soured when he suspected Ms Nibbs of having affairs.
Their son said that since his mother no longer had to care for his younger sister, Nibbs felt she had changed and was not the "housewife" she used to be.
During a row Ms Nibbs admitted seeing other men, taunting her partner by saying: "I have had sex eight times."
The next day she inadvertently predicted her own killing as she left work with the words: "If I'm not in Friday, I might be dead."
Nibbs told the court that he had only meant to "slap her around a bit" and it was only after she was dead that he cut her head off in anger because she "betrayed" him.
But Judge Hilliard rejected Nibbs's claim he only initially "tapped" his wife on the head with a metal bar to get her attention.
Cutting her head off was an act of "grotesque savagery" in revenge for her perceived "treachery", Judge Hilliard added.

article Met Office figures released on Tuesday showed December 2015 was the wettest December on record for Wales, with 217% the average rainfall for the month. And it was the wettest calendar month in the UK since records began in 1910.
But despite 359mm (14in) of rain compared to 137mm (5in) in England, Wales did not see the same level of devastating floods which affected parts of the north of England, where there was widespread damage and large-scale evacuations.
So does this mean Wales' flood defences are working?
Natural Resources Wales said existing defences had protected Dolgellau in Gwynedd, and Llandudno Junction in Conwy - but with rising rainfall and changes in wind patterns, scenes like those in England could easily happen this side of the border.
The Met Office said the north of England was particularly badly hit because of a number of factors relating to wind patterns and weather fronts.
Wind direction and where weather fronts ended meant places like Cumbria were "in the firing line" for heavy rainfall, forecasters said.
While Wales also saw torrential downpours, once the rain has fallen other factors come into play including the size of rivers, the shapes of the hills and valleys - which affect what is happening on the ground.
Jeremy Parr, head of flood and operational risk management for Natural Resources Wales, said there were prolonged periods of heavy rain and the impact was felt widely across Wales - but flood prevention schemes and weather factors meant it did escape the worst of the UK's flooding disruption.
"The Met Office station in Capel Curig had record rainfall, with more than three times the average for December.
"However, the worst of the storms and rainfall tracked... to other parts of the UK and so the impacts there were much greater.
"While places like Dolgellau and Llandudno Junction did not flood this time thanks to the schemes which help protect them, we can never completely prevent all flooding. We need to learn to adapt to flooding, and there is no 'one size fits all' solution.
"We need a range of actions and sustained investment over a long period of time."
Environmental journalist George Monbiot said a "temperature anomaly" in the North Pole had caused an unusual wind pattern which affected England more than Wales.
"I know there was some quite serious flooding around mid Wales," he said.
"But there was a really weird pattern of where the rain fell. I understand there was an incredibly weird temperature anomaly in the North Pole, where temperatures which would normally be -40C reaching 1C or 2C.
"This caused a powerful anti-clockwise wind flow sweeping clouds around, just clipping the edge of Wales but hammering England."
Mr Parr added that weather patterns were changing and more intense rainfall was becoming more frequent.
"The scenes over the border could very easily have happened here in Wales," he said.
The Met Office said it was also an exceptionally mild month, smashing the previous December record set in 1934 due to an "El Nino" phenomena, and a warmer atmosphere carries a larger amount of moisture.
El Nino may be another reason for the wet and mild weather. It is a band of unusually warm waters over the tropical pacific oceans.
It forms naturally every few years and disrupts weather patterns all over the world, bringing torrential downpours to California and drought to Australia.
In the UK, the consequences are less clear.
December 2010 was the coldest for a century, with snow and ice causing chaos across Wales.
People living in flood risk areas can do some things to help be prepared should the worst happen:

article Jason Brian Dalton, 45, was to appear in court on Monday, the county prosecutor said.
He was arrested over the shootings at three different locations in Kalamazoo, with no apparent links to the victims.
Mr Dalton, a driver for cab-hailing app Uber, was reported to be picking up passengers in between the attacks.
The company says it had run a background check on the suspect, and police have confirmed he had no criminal record.
"We just can't figure out the motive," public safety chief Jeffrey Hadley told CNN. "There's nothing that gives us any indication as to why he would do this or what would have triggered this. The victims did not know him; he did not know the victims."
He said the attacks were "completely and totally random". None of the victims - which include two people who were seriously injured - had been passengers of the suspect.
Four people - Mary Lou Nye, 62, Mary Jo Nye, 60, Barbara Hawthorne, 68 and Dorothy Brown, 74 - were killed outside a restaurant. Two more victims - Tyler Smith, 17, and his father, Richard, 53 - were shot dead outside a car dealership.
Speaking about the killings and the thorny issue of gun control in the US, President Barack Obama said: "I've got to assume that all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states."
He said the hard truth was that America probably lost more people to gun violence over the weekend than in the San Bernardino attack last year that killed 14 people.
"Clearly we are going to need to do more if we're going to keep innocent Americans safe," he said, urging "a common sense" approach to gun control "in a bipartisan way without some of the ideological rhetoric that so often surrounds the issue".
He brought in stricter background checks on firearms buyers in early January as part of a series of measures to tackle gun violence.
One of the seriously injured in the Kalamazoo attack, a 14-year-old girl, was believed to have been dead for more than hour when she squeezed her mother's hand as doctors were preparing to harvest her organs, police officer Dale Hinz told Michigan Live.
A country prosecutor said the suspect is likely to face multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder when he appears in court on Monday.
They are also investigating whether he took fares between attacks, after a local resident reported a hair-raising ride in Mr Dalton's car shortly before the first incident. Uber also says it is offering the authorities assistance in the case.
The shootings unfolded as follows:
Mr Dalton was arrested in the early hours of Sunday following a police manhunt.
A prayer service was held in honour of the victims at a church in Kalamazoo later on Sunday evening.

article The @ireland account aims to represent a range of voices in the Republic of Ireland.
Ms Marie, originally from the UK, moved to Ireland three years ago and lives there with her two-year-old daughter.
She told the BBC why she decided to apply to curate the Twitter account.
"I wanted to share my positive experiences," she said.
"I wanted to share the work I'm doing around body positivity.
"Ireland has a really strong culture of shame, and I wanted to change that.
"I've followed @ireland for a few years, and I know it has a high percentage of trolling.
"I was expecting a bit of racism, comments on my size and for being English but not a non-stop barrage."
After logging on to the @ireland account on Monday morning at 08:30, Ms Marie quickly began to receive racist tweets.
"I was shocked more than anything," she said.
"It was an eye-opener that a lot of people have hateful and extreme views - it was pure hatred.
"A lot of people saw an image of a black woman and made a lot of assumptions, saying, 'Go back to Africa,' and telling me to go back to my own country, when I was born in Norwich.
"I was getting 500 notifications an hour.
"The vast majority of them were abusive comments and retweets of those comments."
Ms Marie said the abuse had predominantly come from outside Ireland.
"It was mostly anonymous accounts and largely based in America," she said.
"I suppose people feel safer saying these things online."
Ms Marie's offline experience in Ireland has been very different.
"I've only been welcomed in Ireland so far," she said.
"I've generally been lucky that I haven't had many bad experiences of racism in my life."
Ms Marie criticised the racist posts, in her own tweets.
"I expected trolls, and backlash, and criticism," she wrote.
"But today I have experienced racism, sexism, fat-phobia and homophobia to a degree I have never known.
"I have had eight hours of non-stop hate thrown at me.
"I am hurt, shocked and appalled."
She tweeted about her ethnicity and background.
"I applied to curate the account to share my experiences living here, my personal interests/experiences, and the body positivity work that I do," she wrote.
"Many non-natives, non-residents, and persons of colour have gone before me, so I felt welcome to apply."
James Hendicott, another Briton who previously ran the @ireland account, pointed out he had received a different response.
Ms Marie still has up to the end of the week to curate the account.
"I've spoken to the guy that runs @ireland, and he wants me to see it through," she said.
"The abuse has largely stopped, so hopefully I can get on with it.
"I hope it's opened people's eyes and shown that racism is something we still all need to work together to change.
"It's time for all prejudice to stop."

article Danielle Marr, 18, was in a science class at Waid Academy in Anstruther, Fife, when her pager sounded in school for the first time.
The teenager, who is in her final year, was called out to Anstruther lifeboat station at 10:40 on Wednesday, where she was joined by fellow volunteers.
They set off to help a 28ft vessel that had suffered mechanical failure.
Another new volunteer, mother-of-two Louise McNicoll, 30, was also involved in the rescue which happened off the coast of Crail.
Danielle said: "I was assisting a junior pupil in a science class when my pager sounded.
"It was a strange feeling as it's the first time I have heard the pager go off in school and the teachers and staff were great to allow me to exit so quickly.
"The shout itself went exactly to plan as we regularly practise towing the all-weather lifeboat with our D class and vice versa, so it wasn't the first time that myself or Louise have worked on this task, but it certainly was a different feeling doing it in a shout scenario."
The teenager has permission to leave class for rescues.
She is following in the footsteps of her older brother Anthony, who has volunteered at the station since Danielle was six.
The two women have volunteered at the lifeboat station for several months.
During the rescue, the volunteers secured a towing line to the boat under the supervision of the coxswain and senior crew before the short journey back to Anstruther harbour.
Ms McNicoll said: "I was getting my son ready for nursery when my pager sounded.
"I had the added extra of dropping my son at my mum's house on the way to the station.
"It was great to see the training we practise put into action and having my first shout alongside Danielle was an added bonus.
"The senior crew assisted us in what we had to do and all in all it was a job well done."

article Some 2.63 million new vehicles were registered in 2015, up about 6% on 2014 and the fourth consecutive year of growth, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
Stronger consumer confidence, special deals and cheap finance drove sales.
Registrations in December are thought to have been the best December figures on record.
It is thought that some 180,000 new cars were registered last month,
The previous record for sales in Britain was set in 2003 when 2.58 million new cars were sold.
Car registrations in the UK, Europe's second-biggest auto market after Germany, fell sharply after the 2007-8 financial crisis but have gradually recovered, returning in 2014 to pre-crisis levels at 2.48 million.
Consumers have benefited from low interest rates and the strengthening of sterling against the euro which has made it cheaper to import cars from countries such as Germany and France.
The expected new record high for registrations comes despite declines in sales for Volkswagen, which accounts for around 20% of British car sales. Sales of some of its brands fell sharply in October and November following the diesel emissions scandal.
Despite this VW saw full-year sales rise 4% across all its brands last year.
A big factor fuelling sales is the availability and cost of finance on forecourts. The SMMT says that 80% of cars are bought with some form of finance and around 60% are purchased using PCP's.
These Personal Contract Purchase plans mean customers can buy a new car for an affordable monthly payment in the same way that you might purchase a new mobile phone.
As PCP's work on a 3 yr buying cycle, that keeps demand for new cars strong.
Before the downturn car sales averaged around 2.3m a year. The industry doesn't know what the new norm for sales will be. But the Chairman of Ford of Britain has told the BBC that overall car sales could hit 2.8m this year.
However, sales of its Skoda brand ended the year down 1% and Seat finished 11% lower after a nearly 50% drop in sales in December.
The best selling car, for the seventh year running, was the Ford Fiesta.
More than 85% of Ford's showroom sales are on finance plans known as PCPs - where customers in effect lease a car - and which are widely credited with having boosted vehicle sales across the industry in recent years.

But online travel accounted for more than 70% of the transactions.
According to research firm Forrester, online sales of retail goods were worth $1.6bn last year.
However, that number is expected to reach $76bn by 2021 as more people across the country get connected to the internet.

article The club had asked its main creditors, which include the council, to write off about 70% of its debts.
Cabinet members discussed the proposal on Thursday.
The council said the redevelopment of the Swalec Stadium was part-funded by loans from creditors including themselves, with £16m owed.
Glamorgan asked creditors to write-off 70% of the money and interest owing and agree to a restructuring of the remaining 30%.
The plan to write off £4.4m from a debt of £6.4m the club owes to the council was recommended in a report to the council's cabinet.
Councillor and cabinet member Graham Hinchey said: "As with many organisations, changes to the economy had a detrimental effect on Glamorgan County Cricket Club.
"However, it is imperative that this long established sporting institution does not go into administration."
Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris said: "The council's decision is extremely important to the club and is one of the final pieces in the jigsaw in re-negotiating our debt.
"The club still faces financial challenges in the months and years ahead and we are mindful of our responsibility to develop our business to safeguard our long-term future."
Glamorgan's other main creditors - Allied Irish Bank and Paul Russell - the club's former chairman, have also agreed to the restructuring proposal.
The club successfully hosted an Ashes Test at the Swalec Stadium with Australia in 2009 and will host a further Ashes Test this year.

article The Association of British Travel Agents surveyed 2,043 Britons and found those aged 18 to 24 were the most likely to go abroad without insurance.
It comes after the family of a South Yorkshire traveller in Thailand had to raise £32,000 for his medical care.
Overall a quarter of UK travellers are thought to go abroad without insurance.
In 2015, 35-year-old Craig Lindley, from Barnsley, fell ill while celebrating a friend's wedding on a Thai island.
He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome - which affects the peripheral nervous system - and was left paralysed
He was charged £20,000 for a five-day course of treatment in Bangkok.
His ambulance and speedboat from the island to Koh Samui Hospital also cost £17,000.
After an online appeal his family and friends raised £32,000 towards his medical bills.
The Association of British Travel Agents' (Abta) Mark Tanzer said: "Rather than having to resort to the kindness of strangers, holidaymakers should make sure that they have the right insurance in place."
Overall, the number of British travellers surveyed without insurance has risen to 25% in the 12 months to May, up from 22% the previous year.
Mr Tanzer added: "Every year, we see cases of people falling into difficulty due to travelling without insurance.
"Often their families have to raise thousands of pounds for their treatment or repatriation and that's why it is so worrying to see an increase in younger people travelling without insurance."
In 2016, Michael Doyle, 29, was admitted to a private hospital in Bulgaria after being diagnosed with blood poisoning.
He required dialysis treatment which he received in the hospital, but he passed away before his parents were able to raise about £20,000 required to bring him back to the UK for more treatment.
His father John has advised people to get travel insurance. He said: "Go and enjoy yourself, Bulgaria is an excellent place to go, it's not different from anywhere else in the world but you need to have insurance."
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokeswoman Susan Crown said: ""The FCO cannot pay medical bills if you are hospitalised abroad, nor can we fly you home.
"Take out an appropriate insurance policy and make sure you know what it covers you for. It may feel like an added expense but it's very worthwhile if you compare it to what you could end up paying if something goes wrong on holiday."

article Three peers and an MP have been accused of being prepared to break the rules on lobbying in Parliament.
MP Patrick Mercer resigned the Conservative whip after claims by BBC's Panorama that he broke Parliament's lobbying rules by accepting Â£4,000 to lobby for business interests in Fiji.
Mr Mercer, who was approached by a fake company set up by the programme, denies wrongdoing, saying he took the money for consultancy work outside Parliament and has referred himself to the Parliamentary standards commissioner.
Separately, two Labour peers have been suspended and one Ulster Unionist member of the House of Lords has resigned the whip after allegedly agreeing to do parliamentary work for payment in contravention of the rules. Lord Cunningham, Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate and Lord Laird all deny any wrongdoing.
Lobbying in order to influence political decisions is widely regarded as a legitimate part of the democratic process. Lobbyists are firms or individuals that are paid to influence such decisions.
They are often former politicians or ex-civil servants who have developed personal contacts with those in power.
Alternatively, individuals. firms, charities and other groups can lobby on their own, without paying professional lobbyists.
There has long been concern that, if unregulated, lobbyists will begin to wield an unhealthy level of influence over political decision-making. This, it is argued, could mean the corruption of peers and MPs and undermine democracy.
Before the 2010 election, future Prime Minister David Cameron said lobbying was "the next big scandal waiting to happen".
The coalition agreement, which set out the government's programme in 2010, said: "We will regulate lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists and ensuring greater transparency."
However, the policy has not yet made it into the government's legislative programme. There was no mention of it in the last Queen's Speech, but ministers say they are consulting on plans.
Cabinet Minister Francis Maude has hinted that a new law could be introduced within the next year.
All MPs, including ministers, are subject to a code of conduct when it comes to their outside interests and dealings.
They have to register their financial interests, including remunerated employment outside Parliament.
They are allowed to work as a consultant or be paid for advice.
However, they are forbidden from acting as a "paid advocate" - taking payment for speaking in the House; asking a parliamentary question, tabling a motion, introducing a bill or tabling or moving an amendment to a motion or bill or urging colleagues or ministers to do so.
They can:
They must:
In addition, ministers must comply with guidelines when they leave office:
The House of Lords Code of Conduct, which says peers must show "selflessness", "openness" and "accountability", states they have to:
It also advises that peers "should be especially cautious in deciding whether to speak or vote in relation to interests that are direct, pecuniary and shared by few others".
Peers, unlike MPs, are paid expenses rather than a salary, and are allowed to give general advice and act as consultants if this does not influence their behaviour.
It is the job of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to look into complaints against MPs. The commissioner reports to the Committee on Standards, which then decides on a course of action to take against an MP, including recommending suspension from the Commons, if this is necessary.
MPs vote on whether to implement the recommendations.
For peers, the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards looks at allegations. The report goes to the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which reviews the findings and can recommend a punishment to the Committee for Privileges and Conduct. Peers have a right of appeal against this.
The final decision on punishment is made by the House of Lords as a whole.

article Lost sales and a "significant impact" on growth in south east Asia have contributed to the company cutting its near-term trading outlook.
Sales tumbled after laboratory tests in India revealed high lead levels in some packets of the hugely popular noodles.
In its trading statement, Nestle said it remained in talks with authorities to get Maggi back on the shelves.
Nestle, the world's largest packaged food company, said group sales for the nine months to the end of September fell 2.1% to 64.9bn Swiss francs ($68bn; £44bn), missing analysts' forecasts.
The company cut its 2015 growth outlook to around 4.5%, below its long-term forecasts for 5%-6% growth.
Chief executive Paul Bulcke said: "After a good performance in the first half of the year, we were impacted in the third quarter by exceptional events, with Maggi noodles in India and a rebate adjustment in Nestle Skin Health."
He added that growth in China continued to be lower than expected.

article It extended an extremely rare invitation to the world's media to come to Pyongyang to see a major military parade.
Officials here used the event to attack the "imperialist" United States, as they have done on many previous occasions.
But North Korea also gave the world a glimpse of something new: it unveiled the man many believe will be this country's next leader.
Kim Jong-un is tipped to succeed Kim Jong-il, his father - and North Korea's current leader - who is believed to be in poor health.
Getting accurate information out of one of the world's most secretive states is not easy.
Journalists, analysts and foreign governments often have to read between the lines or work out the meaning of symbolic events.
Last month Kim Jong-un was made a four-star general and given senior positions in the government and the Korean Workers' Party. Many thought then that the younger Mr Kim would eventually succeed his father.
This weekend foreign journalists had a chance to confirm that suspicion when they were unexpectedly allowed to visit North Korea.
Just hours after landing in Pyongyang's shabby airport - there is little air traffic - we were whisked to a special performance of the Arirang Games.
Annual performances take place over a series of weeks involving tens of thousands of singers, acrobats and gymnasts in an open-air stadium.
Koreans 'don't want' young Kim
Profile: Kim Jong-un
For Saturday night's show the venue was ringed with soldiers carrying machine guns. There were security checks for the audience.
Inside there seemed to be a selection of North Korea's most important people: army officers in full uniform and civilians in sharp suits.
During one part of the show the lights suddenly shone on the seats reserved for the most important guests.
There was Kim Jong-il, known as the "Dear Leader", and with him was his third son, Kim Jong-un. The audience turned their heads to look and then cheered.
The two men appeared together again on Sunday at the military parade, which took place in Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung Square - named after the current leader's father, the founder of North Korea.
The parade was organised to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party.
North Korea used the event to show off some of its military hardware. There were rocket launchers, missiles and tanks spewing smoke.
There were also thousands of goose-stepping soldiers, marching in perfect unison. The ground shook as they filed past the main podium, where Kim Jong-il and his son were watching.
As the parade ended, many of those who had taken part surged forward towards the podium and began chanting Kim Jong-il's name.
Many were crying, although in a country where complete acceptance of the current leadership is essential, it is not clear whether they were genuinely moved.
Kim Jong-il responded to the call and came forward, clapping his hands and waving. He looked frail as he walked along the viewing platform with a noticeable limp.
He is reported to have had a stroke in 2008. If he is ill, it could explain why he is so keen to rapidly promote his third son, who is only in his late twenties.
Until recently Kim Jong-un was hardly known even inside North Korea, but people here are already referring to him as the "Young General".
It might not be long before the Kims extend their family's iron rule over North Korea for another generation.

article HÃ©lÃ¨ne Turon, an economics lecturer at Bristol University, was subjected to remarks made on a social media site.
The comments are said to include sexual innuendo and derogatory remarks about her teaching.
In a statement, the university said it takes "cyber-bullying very seriously, whether the victim is a student or a member of staff".
It added that students "involved in such activities would be dealt with under our disciplinary procedures".
The comments were made on the social media Yik Yak which allows users to anonymously post comments on discussions in their locality.
The story was reported by Bristol University student newspaper The Tab.
The publication reported that Ms Turon chastised her first-year students, explaining how she was concerned her teenage children could have seen the comments, before walking out.
She told the paper there is a "difference between public and private gossip" and there should be a discussion about "what the appropriate amount of respect students should have for staff and fellow students is".
Kin Knappett, president of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said it has "seen an increase in cyber bullying" amongst its members.
She added: "Young people think they have a free range to say what they want, how they want and where they want, without thinking about how it will affect anyone else."
The union is calling for better education around the issue of cyber bullying and the "long-term implications" of online comments.
Paul Bridge, University and College Union head of higher education, said they "strongly condemn any form of bullying against staff or student".
He added that victims of cyber bullying "experience the same feelings of fear, intimidation, stress, low morale as other forms of bullying and all steps must be taken to ensure cases are reported and fully investigated".

article Cardiff West Labour MP Kevin Brennan told the prime minister: "The House will have surprised to find that the manner of his death has been by a drone strike against a British citizen in Syria."
Mr Brennan said there would be questions about what happened from MPs and the family. He asked Mr Cameron to be "as forthcoming as he can with explaining the nature of the threat that this 21-year-old man posed to the United Kingdom in the light of the action that he has outlined to the House today."
The prime minister said he would be as forthcoming as he could be but said he was restricted "because of operational sensitivities and national security reasons."
In his statement, he told MPs: "Both Junaid Hussain and Reyaad Khan, were British nationals based in Syria who were involved in actively recruiting ISIL sympathisers and seeking to orchestrate specific and barbaric attacks against the West including directing a number of planned terrorist attacks right here in Britain, such as plots to attack high profile public commemorations, including those taking place this summer."
The prime minister's official spokeswoman later made clear that the threat against commemorations included those that took place before the August 21 operation. Asked if the threat was against the royal family, she said: "The threat was against Britain and the security of the British people."
The prime minister insisted what he called a "precision airstrike" against Khan was "entirely lawful" although the government will not publish the attorney general's advice.

article The Premiership's bottom club remain seven points adrift with four matches to play and must face the top three.
Charlie Sharples, Billy Burns and Lewis Ludlow's tries gave visitors Gloucester a win that moved them up to eighth.
Max Crumpton crossed late on for Bristol before Jonny May broke quickly to clinch Gloucester a bonus point.
With away games to Exeter and Saracens to come either side of hosting leaders Wasps, Friday's defeat left Bristol needing to stun at least one of the title contenders if they are to avoid an immediate return to the second tier.
After Burns had kicked Gloucester ahead with an early penalty, full-back Jason Woodward missed two kicks for the hosts before fly-half Billy Searle made it 3-3 from the tee.
Sharples - only on the field as a temporary replacement while England wing May received a head-injury assessment - was then fed by Tom Marshall and crossed in the corner and Burns' sweetly-struck conversion made it 10-3.
In a bruising first half that included several delays for medical treatment - the lengthiest of which saw Bristol's Tusi Pisi stretchered off - both sides traded further penalties as Gloucester's Marshall ended the half in the sin bin after a deliberate knock-on.
After the break, Burns capitalised on a mistake from Luke Arscott to extend Gloucester's lead and Ludlow added a third try when he powered over after a driving maul.
Replacement hooker Crumpton's score offered the hosts some consolation but, as they pushed for a seemingly-unlikely losing-bonus point, they were further punished as the Cherry and Whites' swift late counter gave May time and space to add their fourth.
Victory ended Gloucester's run of six away league games without victory - including five straight away defeats - and moved them to within four points of the top six.
Bristol interim head coach Mark Tainton:  "We created opportunities and field position, but we didn't execute, and Gloucester did.
"We are getting in the right areas of the field, but we are not executing, and when we turned the ball over or made a mistake, we got punished.
"We can't hide away from it. We've got four games left, three of them against the top three teams in the Premiership, so it is going to be very difficult to get something from them.
"But speaking to the players, we are going to try and fight right to the very end.
"A point or two points from some of those games, and who knows what is going to happen come the final week of the season."
Gloucester interim head coach Jonny Bell: "We soaked up a lot of pressure. We knew Bristol would come hard at us, and we had to defend very well.
"We are not getting ahead of ourselves. We've talked about the next four or five weeks being like a mini-season for us, and we are clearly delighted to get the win.
"A couple of weeks ago (Gloucester lost at home to Harlequins) has come and gone, and there is a lot of water under the bridge since then. It shows a huge amount of character in the side."

article The interior ministry did not identify who was killed, but said the offences were committed in the Qatif region of the oil-rich Eastern Province.
Qatif has witnessed protests and bouts of violent unrest in recent years.
It is home to many of the kingdom's Shia Muslim minority, who complain that they are marginalised and discriminated against by the Sunni monarchy.
In the past two months, a series of attacks in Qatif have targeted security forces.
Two officers were killed in separate bombings in the town of Awamiya last Tuesday and Thursday, while another two were wounded in an attack on Saturday.
In June, a third officer and two other people died in bombings.
Activists have meanwhile accused security forces of opening fire on protesters, and say others are being jailed or sentenced to death for protest-related crimes.
Protests and attacks in Qatif have become more frequent since the January 2016 execution of the prominent Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr, who supported the protests.

article CNN said Venezuelans would now be able to access its information without charge on the internet.
Venezuela's National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) accused CNN of "defaming and distorting the truth".
The accusation came after CNN broadcast a report on alleged passport fraud at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq.
The report alleged that Venezuelan Vice-President Tareck El Aissami was directly linked to the granting of 173 passports, including to members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is designated a terrorist group by the US and other Western powers.
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez gave a news conference on Wednesday in which she dismissed the allegations.
She accused the whistleblower behind them of being an "agent in the service of international intelligence agencies" and of having links to Venezuelan opposition groups.
The ban on the US news channel comes at a time of rising tension between the United States and Venezuela.
On Monday, the US treasury department sanctioned Vice-President El Aissami for allegedly trafficking drugs.
In its statement, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) described him as a drug "kingpin" who worked with traffickers in Mexico and Colombia to ship drugs to the US.
Mr El Aissami accused the US of imperialist aggression.
Tension rose further late on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump posted a photo of himself in the White House meeting Lilian Tintori, the wife of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez.
Mr Lopez is serving a 14-year jail sentence for inciting violence at mass protests in 2014. Mr Lopez, who leads the Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) party says the sentence was politically motivated.
Before the tweet, President Maduro had said: "I don't want problems with Trump".
But after the tweet was posted, Foreign Minister Rodriguez wrote on Twitter that she rejected "the meddling and aggression of US President @realDonaldTrump who tries to give orders in our fatherland".
She also tweeted that President Trump had "sided with the boss behind violent acts" while President Maduro had proposed "initiating a new era of respectful relations" between the two.

article It is not where you would expect to find the main offices of a country's ruling political party.
But left-wing Syriza still has its headquarters nearby, in a show of solidarity with the poor and the vulnerable that it pledged to protect when it came to power.
The sun is beating down, and as eurozone finance ministers discuss the Greek government proposals in Brussels, people here seem to be feeling the heat.
Vasilis Papadopoulos, 24, backed Syriza in Sunday's referendum and voted "No".
But with further austerity measures lined up in the government's latest offer, he has decided it is time to leave his country.
The 24-year-old accountant has applied for a university course in the UK because "I have the feeling that nothing is changing here".
He says he does not regret voting "No", but that he now has to "live with the consequences".
And the consequences so far seem to be a different package of spending cuts and tax hikes.
"I read the terms," he says. "They are really harsh."
The proposals got the backing of the Greek parliament in the early hours of Saturday, although some Syriza members voted against the plan or abstained.
Experts say this left Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras under pressure over his parliamentary majority, and a government reshuffle is likely on Monday.
Isabella Drakopoulou, a waitress who lives in Omonia, says she hopes Greece will get a better deal after Sunday's referendum result, but she is not convinced these proposals will deliver it.
"I think everyone is expecting it to be hard," she says.
"Maybe if all the hard things come now, after 10 years it will get better here."
But so far Isabella, 24, has only seen things getting worse in this area, amid crumbling public healthcare and social services.
"The drug abuse here is getting out control," she says.
"Living in Athens, it makes me sad to see people in such terrible situations."
Whatever the outcome in Brussels, Syriza will have to bring the result back here to Athens.
And then the politicians will have to deal with the destitution on their doorstep.

article Janice Atkinson, MEP for the South East, was due to fight the Folkestone and Hythe seat on 7 May.
She was suspended following a Sun newspaper investigation into potential impropriety by a member of her staff, relating to an expenses claim.
Ms Atkinson has not responded to BBC requests for comment.
Speaking to BBC Radio Kent, party leader Nigel Farage told the BBC a disciplinary hearing would be held "early next week".
He said: "It looks very bad - it couldn't look worse and I'm astonished by it."
The newspaper has published a secret recording appearing to show Janice Atkinson's chief of staff, Christine Hewitt, speaking to the manager of a restaurant in Margate, Kent, before UKIP's spring conference.
In the footage, she appears to ask for an invoice for a much higher sum than the bill she had originally received.
Ms Hewitt is heard to say: "The idea is we overcharge them slightly, because that's the way we repatriate it."
A member of the hotel staff replies: "3,150, is that alright? Yeah, if you're alright with that? Is that enough for you?"
Ms Hewitt then says: "Oh God yeah, that's more than enough."
It is not known whether Ms Atkinson knew or authorised her staff member's apparent actions.
The BBC has been unable to contact Ms Hewitt for comment.
Mr Farage said it was too early to say whether Ms Atkinson would be allowed to run for UKIP in Folkestone and Hythe.
He said: "I spoke to her after midnight and she said it was all to do with bills and fundraising - I was frankly confused by it all."
He added: "I simply couldn't believe it - how on earth could anyone think they could behave like this."
A UKIP spokesman said the party was "incredibly disappointed" with Ms Atkinson, who appeared to have "exercised extremely poor judgement" and to "have acted in a way the party has never and would never condone".
Kent Police said it had not received any reports relating to the newspaper's allegations.
Last summer, Ms Atkinson caused controversy in Kent when she referred to a Thai constituent as a "ting tong".
The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Ms Atkinson was not the first UKIP MEP to give the party a headache.
Two former UKIP MEPs have served jail terms and three have defected to the Conservatives in the last four years.
Earlier this week, members of the Scottish Parliament unanimously condemned remarks made by UKIP MEP David Coburn, after he compared a Scottish government minister, Humza Yousaf, to Abu Hamza.
Abu Hamza is serving life in the US for terrorism offences.
The suspension of Ms Atkinson leaves UKIP with headlines it could do without, our correspondent added.
Folkestone and Hythe is seen as a safe Conservative seat.
It was represented by former Home Secretary and ex-Conservative Party leader Michael Howard, from 1983 to 2010, when he stood down as an MP ahead of the last general election.
Fellow Conservative Damian Collins won the seat in 2010.
Ms Atkinson's suspension came shortly after Mr Farage had warned 2015 would be a "very dirty, nasty" general election campaign and urged his party to "turn the other cheek".
He had been speaking in Rochester where he welcomed two former Conservative Medway councillors, Tom Mason and Vaughan Hewett, who are standing for UKIP in the local elections in May.

A neighbour who came into the house in the town of Avon and took these photos said it was "a harrowing experience".
Bill Belfiore said the black bear refused to be scared off.
"Though it looks cute on the railing, this bear was angry about not being able to get at the food," said Mr Belfiore.
He told emergency responders: "We have a bear attempting to get into a house and he's not afraid of noise, screaming or yelling or pounding."
After pawing at the backdoor - which leads to the kitchen - the stubborn bear tried accessing other doors to the home.
By the time police responded, the bear had already lost interest and left.
Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has advised nearby residents to take steps to "reduce encounters and potential conflicts" with black bears.
They said the state's bear population has been growing, and that they become more active in the spring time.
"If you genuinely care about bears, you should never feed them - either intentionally or unintentionally," DEEP deputy commissioner Susan Whalen said last month.
She said bears have lost their fear of humans are more likely to become a "nuisance" animal.

article Celtic Boys Club founder and former coach Jim Torbett, who has previously been convicted of sexually assaulting boys, faces fresh allegations of abusing young players.
He denies the allegations.
Last month, BBC Scotland aired allegations by two men that they were sexually abused by Torbett when they played for Celtic Boys Club.
One of them, Kenny Campbell, told the programme Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of The Beautiful Game he was molested dozens of times by Torbett over a period of up to four years.
He told me: "I trusted the wrong person. It took me years and years to realise that. He's got a lot to answer for. A lot to answer for."
Last month, I attempted to confront Torbett with the allegations, but neighbours in his block of flats told me he was abroad, perhaps in America.
Then, last week I received a tip that he was indeed in the US, and along with BBC cameraman Alan Harcus, we travelled there and tracked him down to a suburb of Modesto, in California.
For two days we watched as he and a man the BBC understands to be William Gilbert worked in the garden and washed cars. But with strict trespassing laws in the US, in order to put our questions to him, we needed Torbett to set foot on a public pavement.
When they left to go to a local shopping centre, we followed, two cars behind. The pair entered a shop, and we waited for them to emerge. Mr Gilbert, who we heard referring to Torbett as "my dad",  recognised me and attempted to stop us.
I looked inside the shop but Torbett seemed to have disappeared. We waited for around 10 tense minutes as Mr Gilbert patrolled the area. Torbett then emerged from the shop, and I began to ask my questions.
Mr Torbett declined to answer the majority of the questions I put to him about the abuse claims, but when asked what he had to say to Kenny Campbell, he answered: "I have a lot to say. I'll see him in court."
He denied being a paedophile.
During all this, Mr Gilbert attempted to prevent us filming by covering the camera, but eventually Alan managed to free himself and get the camera round to Torbett as he tried to close the car door.
I had placed myself inside the open car door to allow me the time to put my questions to him.
Mr Gilbert then lunged for my microphone, telling me where he wanted to shove it.
They reversed off, with Mr Gilbert at the wheel, driving over my right foot. With that, it was over; it had been a torrid few minutes.
Torbett is travelling on an Esta, which is a visa waiver allowing a maximum stay of 90 days. Any convictions, spent or otherwise, are supposed to be declared to the US Embassy when filling out the form.
Sources in the embassy say someone with a child sex offence conviction would be very unlikely to be allowed entry to the US, so it is unclear what, if anything, Torbett has declared.
The United States does not have access to the Police National Computer, however, they can request details of criminal convictions on an individual request basis.
Failure to declare previous convictions on an Esta can be a criminal offence in the US.
It is understood Torbett is close to the 90 days maximum, and he is expected to return to the UK shortly.
When he does, these questions will persist.
A major police investigation is currently under way into claims that he, and others at Celtic Boys Club, abused boys there over several decades.

article The Czech, 27, was stabbed by an intruder and suffered a career-threatening hand injury.
But the two-time Wimbledon champion was in Paris on Friday as her place in the first-round draw was confirmed.
"I knew this day would come. I'm really happy that I'm here, the dream comes true," said Kvitova.
"I'm here in the draw and I'm here playing tennis again. It was a difficult time for me, of course. It wasn't easy.
"I know that my hand is still not 100% ready, so we will see how everything goes, but I'm happy that I'm able to play again."
Kvitova, a former semi-finalist at Roland Garros, will play world number 86 Julia Boserup of the US in the first round.
It will be her first competitive match since the Fed Cup in November and she enters the tournament with a WTA special ranking of 16 - her status at the time she last played.
Kvitova's surgeon, Radek Kerble, described the injury she suffered as "horrific", adding: "The chances of Petra's hand healing well enough for her to be able to play tennis again were very low for multiple reasons."
However, she had a racquet in her hand again by March and, after initially targeting a return at Wimbledon, brought the date forward as her recovery went better than expected.
"It was a last-minute decision - I have to start somewhere," said Kvitova.
"Not many people believe that I can play tennis again.
"So I'm happy that I can play. I actually already won my biggest fight.
"I'm happy that I like challenges. That was one of the biggest, of course.
"So I stayed in life and I have all my fingers, I can play tennis and I can be here and be in the draw.
"Of course the hand doesn't have that power and the strength yet, but I'm working on it. Hopefully one day everything will be perfect. But we never know still."
Kvitova is unable to discuss the attack, which took place in her apartment in Prostejov on 20 December, because of the ongoing police investigation, but said time is helping her cope with the shock.
"I didn't sleep well the days after, but I wasn't really staying alone," she said.
"I don't really have nightmares. From the beginning I was feeling really weird when I went into the city or somewhere.
"But with time, it's better. But of course I'm more actively watching the people around me."

article Sussex Police said there would be greater security on Saturday because of the national security risk, but there is no specific threat to the event.
Ch Supt Neil Honnor said: "Due to the national security threat assessment we have reviewed our response."
Additional security also includes more road closures, he said.
The force will not be using concrete blocks, Ch Supt Honnor added.
"Lewes bonfire is a very large event and in the current climate it is not unusual to see armed officers at an event of this size," he said.
The number of visitors to Lewes can be as high as 40,000, though last year numbers fell to between 20,000 to 25,000 spectators because of wet weather.
More visitors are expected this year because 5 November falls on a Saturday.
Lewes holds one of Britain's biggest Bonfire Night events with more than 30 different processions making their way through the town.
It has seven bonfire societies, with six of them taking part in the 5 November celebrations.
This year's celebrations are expected to be affected by a strike on the Southern rail network.
Extra buses will be running and travel advice has been issued for people attending the event.

article Officials say that she was unable to make the speech at a Congress party rally in the state of Uttarakhand because she had viral fever.
In August Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition.
Her party has repeatedly refused to comment on the details of her illness.
But media reports have suggested she was treated at a specialist cancer hospital in New York.
The 64-year-old Italian-born leader is seen as India's most powerful politician. She holds no official post, but many consider her the de facto head of the government.
Correspondents say the Indian government faced serious problems during her month-long absence - particularly in relation to corruption scandals - and would have coped better with them had she been around to give advice.
"She has been running a viral fever since yesterday, so today we cancelled the plan for her to go to Uttarakhand," Congress spokesman Janardhan Dwiwedi told the AFP news agency.
"I don't think the fever will last beyond three or four days."
The decision to withdraw from the rally disappointed up to 20,000 supporters keen to catch a glimpse of Mrs Gandhi as her Congress party gears up for a string of important state elections next year that are likely to be crucial to determining whether it can return to power in federal elections due by 2014.
Mrs Gandhi is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. She nominated Manmohan Singh to the prime minister's post in 2004 but is frequently portrayed as being more powerful than him.
She is at the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has ruled India for most of the time since independence in 1947.
Her son and MP Rahul Gandhi is tipped as a future prime minister.

article Fresh from a 342-run first-wicket stand against Northants on Monday, openers Michael Lumb (133) and Riki Wessels (76) put on 178 against the Bears.
Dan Christian's rapid 94 off 47 balls pushed Notts to 415-5, as they became the first non-international team to pass 400 in successive one-day innings.
Warwickshire made 379 all out, Jonathan Trott scoring 100 and Ian Bell 60.
Sam Hain, a centurion in Tuesday's win over Leicestershire, made 69 and put on 106 for the second wicket with Trott.
A partnership of 95 between ex-England team-mates Bell and Trott set the platform for an unlikely run chase, but the visitors' challenge faded once skipper Bell had departed in the 34th over with 186 runs still required for victory.
Notts have won both of their games so far in the North Group, while Warwickshire have won only one of their first three matches.
South Africa are the only other side to have passed 400 in two consecutive one-day outings, doing so against West Indies and Ireland at the 2015 World Cup.
Lumb scored 184, Notts' highest individual limited-overs score, in a record-breaking victory over Northants and he followed that up with an 88-ball ton against Warwickshire.
Left-hander Lumb and Brendan Taylor fell in the same over, but Greg Smith (73) and captain Christian rebuilt with a fourth-wicket stand of 141 in 14 overs to help set a target beyond Warwickshire's reach.
Beginning the final over of the innings on 82, Australia limited-overs international Christian hit Oliver Hannon-Dalby for two consecutive sixes before falling six runs short of a century.
However, Samit Patel struck 17 not out in a five-ball cameo which took Notts to the 18th highest one-day score in history - and also the highest total conceded by Warwickshire in a limited-overs game.

article Pep Guardiola's side responded from going out of the Champions League semi-final by securing the Bundesliga for a record fourth successive campaign.
Lewandowski put Bayern ahead from the penalty spot before doubling the lead after Xabi Alonso's sublime pass.
Moritz Hartmann's penalty made it 2-1 but Bayern clinched the title.
Borussia Dortmund were the only team that could have caught Guardiola's side but their 1-0 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt means Bayern are eight points clear of their nearest rivals going into the final weekend of the league campaign.
Guardiola will therefore take up his new post at Manchester City this summer having secured three Bundesliga titles in three attempts.
The former Barcelona boss had been in a spiky mood on the eve of his penultimate league game following Bayern's defeat by Atletico Madrid on the away goals rule in the Champions League.
Guardiola had accused a dressing-room mole of "damaging" Bayern, after details of an alleged row in the wake of Tuesday's European exit were made public.
But the 45-year-old was all smiles as he celebrated with his players at the final whistle at mid-table Ingolstadt after an 81st win in 101 league games under Guardiola.
Bayern took the lead at Ingolstadt when Franck Ribery was fouled by home captain Marvin Matip in the area and Lewandowski scored the resulting spot-kick.
The Bundesliga's leading scorer then added his second when he drilled home Alonso's superb pass from a tight angle for his 29th league goal of the season.
Ingolstadt's Australia striker Mathew Leckie was denied by Manuel Neuer but the hosts pulled a goal back when Hartmann converted a penalty after a push from behind by Alonso.
After the final whistle, forward Thomas Muller grabbed a loud hailer to lead chants with the fans.
Bayern get a chance to secure a domestic double when they face Dortmund in the final of the German Cup on 21 May.

article The claim: The cost of borrowing for the UK government is at record low levels. The government should take advantage of this to improve the UK's economic performance.
Reality Check verdict: The yield on UK government bonds has been falling to record lows, making borrowing cheaper, despite the recent cut in the UK's credit ratings. Borrowing to invest has the potential to reduce the need for future borrowing, but that's not guaranteed and it could further damage the UK's credit.
He's right about the cost of borrowing. The yields on 10-year UK government bonds have indeed been at record lows in trading over the past week, and that's a good indicator of the sort of amount the government would have to pay to borrow money.
You can only tell what will actually happen when there is a bond sale, as there was on Tuesday morning.
The government sold £2.5bn of bonds maturing in five years, at a record low yield.
The low bond yield is in some ways a bit surprising, as the downgrades from the ratings agencies S&P and Fitch mean they reckon that lending money to the UK government has become less safe.
But, in fact, what has happened is that the yield on government bonds has fallen because in uncertain times people look for relatively safe investments, such as government bonds.
It's not just the yields on UK government bonds that have been falling. The Swiss 50-year government bond has a negative yield for the first time, meaning that investors are prepared to pay to be able to lend money to the Swiss government. German government bonds also have negative yields, while US 10- and 30-year Treasury bonds are also at record low yields.
The rate of interest the government pays on its debt is important because the UK is currently in debt to the tune of £1.6 trillion (excluding holdings in public sector banks), so a small rise in interest rates would be very expensive for the public finances. The amount the country borrows each year (the deficit) has been falling, but the total debt has kept rising.
The Office for Budget Responsibility says that an extra one percentage point on the government's cost of borrowing would cost the exchequer an extra £8bn in 2019-20.
It is also likely, given the recent falls in the value of the pound, that inflation will rise, which will increase the amount the government has to pay on loans linked to the inflation rate.
Chancellor George Osborne has been saying since taking the job in 2010 that it is important to have a plan to balance the books because otherwise investors will lose confidence in the UK economy and the rates of interest the government has to pay will rise. Mr Osborne has now abandoned his target to balance the budget by 2020.
So would extra borrowing at cheap rates be good news for the economy in the long term? It could be.
Mr Crabb was campaigning on a platform of borrowing £100bn to invest in infrastructure, which would probably increase the amount the government was spending on servicing debt, even if the rate of interest fell slightly.
But his plan was that doing so would increase productivity. Investing in infrastructure is supposed to improve productivity because, for example, better transport links mean goods get to market more quickly.
Greater productivity would increase the amount of money the government raises through taxes.
Also, employing people to create the infrastructure would stimulate the economy.
So if the borrowed money were invested well, it could make it easier for the government to reduce the amount it borrows in the future, when the cost of borrowing might be higher.
But it would depend on the government being able to increase borrowing without damaging investors' confidence.

While Sleepover At The Zoo will feature a team of experts staying up all night at Bristol Zoo.
They will be broadcast across BBC One, Two and Four over the next few years.
New series Oceans will continue where the award-winning programme Blue Planet left off in 2001.
It will look at some of the marine species that have been discovered over the past decade.
These include the bizarre-looking blanket octopus, the "alarmingly hairy" yeti crab and the velvet belly lanternshark which uses a light-sabre style glowing spine to defeat its enemies.
The Hunt will explore the competition between predators and their prey, including footage of polar bears filmed hunting bearded seals for the very first time.
Tunacam and Squidcam
Dolphins, tigers and kangaroos will all get their own dedicated series.
Dolphin: Spy In The Pod uses spycams disguised as sea creatures - dubbed Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam - to get even closer to some of the most loved animals in the world.
A decade on from Planet Earth, the new six-part series One Planet will provide "the ultimate tour of an iconic ecosystem".
It will look at how animals and plants evolve in response to areas as diverse as mountains, deserts, wild islands and man-made cities.
"By using new filming techniques, peerless research and great storytelling, the next few years are all about shows that will delight our UK and global audiences," said the BBC's head of commissioning for natural history and science, Kim Shillinglaw.
She continued: "From new discoveries in Oceans and never-before-filmed behaviour in The Hunt, to assembling 75 cameras in one place for Countdown To The Rains and the ground-breaking spirit of our Sleepover At The Zoo Event, we've never had as much range, scale and innovation to offer."
Top Gear's Richard Hammond will front a three-part series called Big Weather, which will see him flying a light aircraft into a hailstorm and releasing robot drones into a hurricane.
Three-part series Countdown to the Rains, which began filming from the moment the African dry season ended, will air on BBC Two from Sunday 3 November, presented by Kate Humble and Simon King.
Other highlights include in-depth looks at Alaska, Japan, Patagonia and New Zealand; and Talk to the Animals, which will feature real life Dr Doolittle Lucy Cooke on a mission to understand how animals communicate.

article Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members are set to hold a 24-hour strike from 17:00 BST on 4 June and a 48-hour strike from 17:00 BST on 9 June.
On Thursday the union rejected a fresh pay offer by Network Rail.
Both sides had met again on Saturday with conciliation service Acas to try to resolve the issue.
The workers, including signallers and maintenance staff, are also planning to ban overtime from 6-12 June.
Saturday's talks followed earlier discussions on Friday.
Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, had said in a message to members on Friday: "Your negotiating team was invited to further discussions at Acas on the Network Rail dispute at short notice this afternoon."
He said the union's full team would be in London on Saturday to take the negotiations forward.
"RMT is fully committed to achieving a negotiated settlement and will be available in London for discussions for the whole weekend and beyond in order to achieve a settlement."
The RMT's 16,000 members at Network Rail work across the company's operations and maintenance departments.
A planned strike over last week's bank holiday was suspended after Network Rail tabled a revised pay offer to workers.
Network Rail originally offered a four-year deal of a single Â£500 payment followed by three years of rises in line with RPI inflation.
But the revised offer was for two years, with a 1% rise this year, and a rise of about 1.4% next year. It was also established that there would be no compulsory redundancies for the duration of the agreement.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has previously said he considered strike action "unnecessary and unreasonable".

article And on an estimated basis, the last time we saw a price fall in the UK was March 1960, before even I was born, when there was a drop (probably) of 0.6%.
So my natural impulse is to say that deflation has arrived in Britain - because there is no other word in the English language than "deflation" to describe this phenomenon.
However many of those who define themselves as "serious economists" (that's not me, by the way - I'm a hack) are desperately anxious that I and you don't use the "d" word - for two reasons.
One is that they say proper deflation is a long term term trend of declining prices, and they believe - almost certainly correctly - that these current price falls won't endure much more than a month or two.
The other is that proper deflation is pernicious: if we believed that prices were set to fall month after relentless month, we would spend less - in the hope of picking up bargains later - and our bosses would pay us less.
That would place a deadening weight on our ability to grow the economy - a weight made heavier by the intractable problem of our massive household debts, in that our capacity to service those debts is diminished when incomes don't grow.
Or to put it another way, there is a fear - in the Treasury and the Bank of England - that if you and I talk too freely about deflation having arrived, we would acquire a deflationary mentality and bring on the terrible malaise - and the UK could find itself turning into stagnating Japan.
My suggestion therefore is that, for now at least, we talk about what's occurring as either mild deflation or non-pernicious deflation or even - as I've styled it before - "good" deflation.
Just to be clear, the fact that there've been falls in the prices of essentials - food, non-alcoholic drinks and transport - actually increases our standard of living in the short term.
Because we have no choice but to eat, when food prices fall, our money goes further - and we are better off.
So this kind of deflation may in fact be stimulating consumer spending and economic activity.
Hooray for "good" deflation.
That said, although there is no reason to panic that prices are falling, it would equally be foolish to pretend that the causes of this deflation are benign.
The initial spur to the current fall in prices was last year's collapse in the oil price - which was in part due to an unexpected slowdown in the global economy, especially in China and the eurozone.
And that led the European Central Bank to cut the cost of credit to less than zero, which in turn led the euro to slide, which meant that the price of all that stuff we buy from the eurozone dropped - or to put it another way, the ECB exported the eurozone's deflation to us.
There are at last signs of a mild revival in the eurozone - though the precariousness of Greece's ability to pay its huge debts mean that revival isn't yet wholly bankable.
And the oil price has risen 50% from its lows of a few weeks ago.
So this bout of relatively benign deflation should be transformed into mild inflation within the coming weeks.
No need to panic therefore about today's bit of history.
But as Mark Carney conceded only a few days ago, the Bank of England cannot ease up on its vigilance in trying to steer price rises back to the target rate of 2% a year.
Because unless we experience a bit of proper inflation back in the system, we'll never break the shackles of our cursed enormous debts.

article The warning comes in an interview with John Beattie for BBC Scotland's new current affairs programme, Timeline.
She expressed frustration at what she says are years of missed opportunities to capitalise on the grand slam success of her sons, Andy and Jamie Murray.
The Lawn Tennis Association announced a £15m investment in the sport last year.
The funding - half of which will come from SportScotland - would have a "transformational" effect on Scottish tennis, it was claimed.
Ms Murray said she wanted to see the investment doubled so that indoor facilities could be built across the country.
She is backing controversial plans for a major new development on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, which would include 12 tennis courts.
"Andy and Jamie may only play for another two or three years, and when they stop playing, that's too late to start creating a legacy," she said.
"If you wait two or three years, when they've gone, tennis could go back to being largely irrelevant in this country again.  It absolutely has to be done now.
"I think the key with this £15m for indoor facilities is to turn it into at least £30m so that we can really, really spread the courts across the country.
"But facilities is one thing, the activity within those facilities has got to be good. A bigger and better quality tennis delivery workforce is crucial as well."
Both of her sons ended a hugely successful 2016 as world number one, after clocking up a series of tournament wins.
Her youngest, now Sir Andy Murray, won Wimbledon for a second time and knocked Novak Djokovic from the top of the world standings.
The brothers, who grew up in Dunblane, even managed to return to Scotland, competing in the Davis Cup in Glasgow in front of a huge crowd.
The success of such high profile events prove that there is a huge appetite for tennis in Scotland, said Ms Murray.
"For us to actually have some bigger events up here has just put fuel to the fire," she said. "There is a demand and the time is now."
The tennis coach added: "In the last nine years we have missed a massive window of opportunity to really grow the game, because there have been no new indoor courts built - not courts that are available to the general public - in the nine years that Andy's been in the top five.
"So it's been an enormous source of frustration to me because I've seen the opportunity that the success of the boys has presented to our sport, and yet nobody has really grasped it and seen what we could do."
Tennis club membership has increased by 42% in Scotland, according to the Lawn Tennis Association.
Its chief executive, Michael Downey, said it aims to double the number of covered courts in Scotland within 10 years, and to increase participation across the board.
He said the £15m investment announced last month was the "largest ever capital investment for tennis in Scotland and will make tennis more accessible for years to come, improving facilities and bringing certainty of play to a region that richly deserves it.
"Scotland is an area that sees on average 200 days of rain a year and we recognise that it is under-resourced versus the rest of Britain and other European nations when it comes to the number of covered tennis courts per capita.
"We believe that we can leverage even more funds through local government and other partners, so that figure is expected to increase significantly."
Mr Downey added: "Our door is always open for collaboration with the Murray family, as they played such a critical role in raising the profile of our great sport."
Timeline is broadcast on BBC Two Scotland at 19:30 on Thursday. It will be available afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

article The trust already has 150 individual renewables schemes, but the new document projects how fossil fuel will be reduced across its properties.
It aspires to set an example to others by integrating renewable energy into sensitive landscapes.
The organisation has been criticised for its chairman's vociferous campaign against wind power.
This is considered as the renewable source with most potential in the UK.
Under its new plan, the trust's main renewables by 2020 will be hydro (27%) and biomass (21%); augmented by heat pumps (1%) and solar (0.5%).
Grid electricity will supply 26% of its power, gas 15% and LPG 6%. Oil - currently a major cost and carbon source for the trust's rural properties - will be reduced to just 3%.
There are also plans to cut energy consumption by 20%. Wind power will play no part, because the trust's historic landscapes are deemed too sensitive.
Patrick Begg, rural enterprise director for the trust, which aims to preserve historic buildings and land for the enjoyment of the public, told BBC News: "We've put all our effort to make the big leap in generating renewable energy from all our properties. Our new programme will get us to (50% of energy) by 2020."
The subsidised renewables will save the organisation money, he said, producing an expected return on capital of 10% - much better than traditional investments.
Morden Hall Park, in south-west London, already boasts an array of renewables, including a wood-fired boiler, different sorts of solar panels and what is claimed to be the UK's most energy-efficient historic building, the Stable Yard.
The new showpiece, behind the old water wheel and Snuff Mill, is an Archimedes screw reclining in the River Wandle, lazily generating power for the visitor centre (the Archimedes screw was originally designed as an irrigation pump. Its modern adaptation allows power to be generated from a low head of water).
The biggest unexpected bonus to the trust overall has come from biomass burning for heating. The organisation owns 25,000 hectares of woodland and Mr Begg acknowledged initial fears that wildlife would be harmed if the woods were managed more intensively for fuel.
"We were very pleased to see that the opposite has been the case," he said. "Managing woods more intensively, including coppicing, has actually increased biodiversity."
The trust's efforts overall have been applauded - but with reservations. It is a major land-holder, but if all the improvements go to plan will still be generating the tiniest fraction of the UK's renewable energy.
What is more, its chairman Simon Jenkins has used his influential newspaper columns to fuel opposition to wind energy, which is the most readily available large-scale renewable energy source in the UK.
This has been highly controversial with some environmentalists accusing him of setting back the cause of renewable energy in a desire to preserve the landscape in aspic.
Mr Begg said: "Simon has some very strong opinions about wind, which he's free to express. The Trust has been perfectly clear - we're not anti-wind, we're anti-wind in the wrong place, badly designed."
He said the Trust, an organisation loved by Britain's middle classes, had no misgivings about receiving electricity subsidies from poor people struggling to pay their bills. The subsidy system, he said, was designed to tackle climate change and the Trust wished to play its part.
The majority of the trust's estate was free to enter, he said There were no plans to open the other properties free of charge to people in fuel poverty.

article Mr Renzi formally resigned on Monday after his defeat in a constitutional referendum a day earlier, but the president requested the delay.
President Sergio Mattarella will later have to either choose a new prime minister or call early elections.
European leaders have been playing down the risks of fallout from the crisis.
It comes amid fears of long-term instability for the country's troubled banking sector in the long-term. Shares in Italian banks lost ground following news of Mr Renzi's defeat.
Sunday's No vote on constitutional reform was widely seen as a rejection of establishment politics in Italy.
Mr Renzi held a final brief cabinet meeting on Monday evening, before travelling to the presidential palace to submit his formal resignation.
President Mattarella then asked him to stay on for the budget bill, which is expected to be passed by the Senate in a matter of days.
He wanted to avoid "the risks of a provisional budget", the president said in a statement (in Italian).
The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says the move will help to reassure markets that the referendum result has not derailed the country's affairs.
Anti-establishment opposition parties have been calling for early elections, although it is unclear yet whether this will happen.
Instead, the president may appoint a caretaker administration led by Mr Renzi's Democratic Party, which would carry on until an election due in the spring of 2018.
Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan is the favourite to succeed Mr Renzi as prime minister.
The No vote won with nearly 60% against 40% for the Yes campaign. With a turnout of nearly 70%, it was a heavier than expected defeat for the government.
Mr Renzi staked his political future on his attempt to change Italy's cumbersome political system. He wanted to strengthen central government and weaken the Senate, the upper house of parliament.
His opponents - including some within his own party - had argued that the reforms would give the prime minister too much power. The electorate agreed.
More than a resounding victory for the No camp, it was a chance for a medley of populist parties to reject establishment politics.
The opposition, headed by the Five Star Movement, capitalised on Mr Renzi's declining popularity, years of economic stagnation, and the problems caused by tens of thousands of migrants arriving in Italy from Africa.
After the vote, Mr Renzi defended his record, saying exports and job numbers were up and unemployment was down to 11.7%.
Five Star's leader, Beppe Grillo, has called for an election "within a week".
The result is being seen as a blow to the EU, although there is no question of Italy leaving the union.
Both Five Star and the Northern League are opposed to the eurozone but not to membership of the EU itself.
Reuters news agency quoted German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble as saying there was no reason for a euro crisis but that Italy urgently needed a functioning government.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said she "took note with regret" of Mr Renzi's resignation but Germany would offer to work closely with the next Italian government.
But the leader of the far-right Front National in France, Marine Le Pen, tweeted: "The Italians have disavowed the EU and Renzi. We must listen to this thirst for freedom of nations."
Markets seemed to have taken Mr Renzi's departure in their stride. The euro fell initially to a 20-month low but rebounded again. Shares in Italian banks lost ground on Monday afternoon, following a dip and rebound in the morning.
But there are concerns over the long-term financial stability in the eurozone's third largest economy. The economy is 12% smaller than when the financial crisis began in 2008.
The banks remain weak and the country's debt-to-GDP ratio, at 133%, (second only to Greece's in the eurozone) means many Italian banks are in need of refinancing.
There is a risk that the failure of a major bank - such as the troubled Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena - could set off a wider crisis, but repairing the banks becomes more difficult amid political uncertainty.

article As many as 50,000 people gathered on an island near the Kremlin to condemn alleged ballot-rigging in parliamentary elections and demand a re-run.
Other, smaller rallies took place in St Petersburg and other cities.
Communists, nationalists and Western-leaning liberals turned out together despite divisions between them.
The protesters allege there was widespread fraud in Sunday's polls though the ruling United Russia party did see its share of the vote fall sharply.
Demonstrations in the immediate aftermath of the election saw more than 1,000 arrests, mostly in Moscow, and several key protest leaders such as the anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny were jailed.
A message from Mr Navalny was released through his blog, saying: "The time has come to throw off the chains. We are not cattle or slaves. We have a voice and we have the strength to defend it."
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has never experienced popular protests like these before, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow.
During his decade in power, first as president then prime minister, he has grown used to being seen as Russia's most popular and powerful politician.
But as one of the protesters put it to our correspondent, Russia is changing.
Police put the number gathering on Moscow's Bolotnaya Square for the "Fair Elections" rally at 25,000 while organisers talked of 100,000.
By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow
Nobody believes the elections were free and fair. Many are also asking that the head of the election commission stands down, and some are going even further and demanding that Vladimir Putin himself resigns.
There's a real sense of anger - and although the numbers are not that big in global terms, in Moscow terms this is a very, very significant demonstration.
This number simply haven't come out onto the streets of Moscow since 1990s.
It should not be underestimated what a significant moment this is.
It may not deal a fatal blow to Mr Putin's government, but it is certainly the most severe wake-up call he has received during 12 years in power.
Rattling the political establishment
The BBC's Daniel Sandford reports from the scene that the number seems to be closer to 50,000, and people continued to rally on the square after hearing the speakers.
A resolution was passed calling for the cancellation of Sunday's election results, new elections, the resignation of electoral commission chief Vladimir Churov, an investigation into the alleged ballot-rigging and the immediate release of arrested protesters.
Konstantin Kosachyov, a United Russia MP authorised to speak on behalf of the Kremlin, ruled out holding negotiations on the organisers' demands.
"With all respect for the people who came out to protest, they are not a political party," he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.
Authorities had permitted the protest on condition the rally was relocated from central Revolution Square to Bolotnaya Square, an island in the Moscow River just south of the Kremlin where access points could be easily controlled.
Marchers to the rally streamed across a bridge under the walls of the Kremlin walls, past a long line of police.
Prominent figures at the rally included younger opposition activists like Yevgenia Chirikova, as well as former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister under the late Boris Yeltsin.
Picture gallery
At least 50,000 police and riot troops were deployed in Moscow ahead of Saturday's protests and the city began to resemble a police state rather than a democracy, Daniel Sandford says.
There were no immediate reports of protest-related arrests in Moscow but the interior ministry reported 130 arrests at rallies across the country, most of them in Khabarovsk in the far east.
In other developments
In St Petersburg, Russia's second city, thousands packed into Pionerskaya Square to hear speeches calling for the election to be re-run and for Mr Putin to resign, the BBC's Richard Galpin reports.
The protest was peaceful and well organised though some protesters were dragged away by police elsewhere in the city.
Daniil Klubov, a student leader at the rally in St Petersburg, told the BBC students had been under pressure not to attend the protests.
"I do not belong to any political movement - I am just a student who is tired of all these lies," he said.
He and others, he said, had received anonymous threats on vKontakte, a Russian networking website similar to Facebook, that they faced prison terms, expulsion from university or military conscription.
"Some people are really scared but a lot of people understand that the more people who turn out, the better our chances," he added.
Police put the turnout in St Petersburg at 10,000.
According to the official results of the elections to Russia's Duma, United Russia saw its share of the vote fall from 64% to 49%, though it remains easily the biggest party.
But there is a widespread view, fuelled by mobile phone videos and accounts on internet social networking sites, that there was wholesale election fraud and that Mr Putin's party cheated its way to victory.
On Friday, the presidential Council for Human Rights advising Mr Medvedev said the reports of vote-rigging were of deep concern, and that the elections should be rerun if they were confirmed.
However the council has no power to order a fresh ballot, correspondents say.
Mr Putin, who was president between 2000 and 2008, remains widely predicted to win a presidential election in March.
On Thursday, he blamed the US for stoking the recent unrest, after Secretary of State Hilary Clinton expressed reservations over the poll.

article State media said rebels shelled a mosque in the government-held district of Bab al-Faraj, killing 15 people.
In the rebel-held east, government air strikes reportedly left at least 11 dead and destroyed a medical facility - the second to be hit in a week.
The military meanwhile said a "regime of calm" would begin elsewhere at 01:00 on Saturday (22:00 GMT on Friday).
A statement said it would last for 24 hours in Damascus and the Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital, and for 72 hours in the northern countryside of Latakia province.
It did not explain why the halt was only temporary, nor was there any mention of Aleppo, where a week of escalating violence has left more than 200 civilians dead.
State television said rebels unleashed a barrage of rocket fire into the government-held western part of Aleppo just as people were coming out of Friday prayers.
The Malla Khan mosque in Bab al-Faraj was hit, it said, causing heavy casualties. Some of the injured were in a serious condition and were likely to die, it added.
Activists meanwhile reported that government aircraft carried out more attacks on rebel-held parts of the city, after hostilities had eased for a short time overnight.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said 11 people were killed, while the Local Co-ordination Committees, an opposition activist network, put the death toll at 14.
The LCC reported that six died when government helicopters dropped barrel bombs - large cylindrical containers filled with explosives and shrapnel - on the Firdous district and four others in a barrel bomb attack in Mughair.
The Syrian Civil Defence, whose volunteer emergency response workers are known as the "White Helmets", said that among the sites targeted by warplanes was a clinic in the Marja area. A nurse was among several people hurt.
On Wednesday night, the al-Quds Hospital in the rebel-held Sukkari district was destroyed in air strikes that US Secretary of State John Kerry said appeared to have been "deliberate".
Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which supported the hospital, said on Friday that 50 people, including six members of staff, were now believed to have been killed.
"The attack on al-Quds Hospital has destroyed one of the last remaining places in Aleppo in which you could still find humanity. Aleppo is already a shell of what it once was, this most recent assault appears determined to eliminate even that," said MSF's head of mission in Syria, Muskilda Zancada.
Ms Zancada also expressed concern at reports that government forces were preparing for a major offensive to encircle rebel-held areas of the city.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that Aleppo was being "pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster".
Large parts of the city have been destroyed and its infrastructure has been severely damaged, leaving civilians without water and electricity for months.
In an interview with the BBC, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on Syria's leaders had to "go beyond their narrow personal perspectives" and call a halt to the destruction of their country.
"How long are they going to fight? They are destroying their people and infrastructure. How will this be resolved?" he asked.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, said the failure of the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court was "an example of the most shameful form of realpolitik".
"In the minds of a many, the world's great powers have in effect become accomplices to the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of human beings, and the displacement of millions," he added.
Russia and the US are backing opposing sides in the conflict.
The latest reports from Aleppo have alarmed regional media outlets opposed to the Syrian regime, with fire being the image of choice.
"Aleppo is burning" reads a stark headline in the Saudi paper al-Riyadh, while an editorial in the Lebanese daily al-Mustaqbal accuses President Bashar al-Assad of "burning Syria while the whole world watches".
An Arabic hashtag translating as "Aleppo is burning" had been re-tweeted more than 180,000 times by Friday morning.
In Syria itself, Nasser Qandil, in pro-government al-Thawra, warns rebels in the city that a "war of all wars" will be unleashed on them in the coming weeks.
Many regional commentators fear the worst in Syria's second city, with London-based Arabic paper al-Sharq al-Awsat predicting a "war of annihilation" by government forces.
Meanwhile Maher Abu Tair, in Jordan's al-Dustur, criticises the wider Arab and Muslim world for "standing and watching the carnage", while Asaad Haider in al-Mustaqbal argues the "world cannot remain blind in the face of a catastrophe".

article The regional outlook report said Wales now has 5,680 manufacturing firms and 156,000 people employed in the sector - 10.7% of the country's total workforce.
It said business confidence remained high "despite an uncertain political landscape".
The report is based on survey data and Office for National Statistics figures.
Compiled by the employers organisation EEF and accountancy and business advisors BDO LLP, the report said manufacturing jobs have risen by 10.6% since March 2010.
It added manufacturing now accounts for 16.8% of the country's total output - the second highest in the UK - with transport, food and drink and metals the largest sectors.
Paul Byard, EEF director for Wales, said: "This is positive news for Wales with our output balance outperforming the rest of the UK again.
"Confidence in the sector in Wales remains high, in spite of a squeeze on particularly domestic budgets, which was the likely cause of some signs of softening at the start of the year."
Paul Falvey, partner and head of manufacturing at BDO in Wales, added: "Wales has been a strong performer over the past year, outperforming other regions in manufacturing output and reporting high levels of confidence and investment intentions."

Dublin-born Morgan, 30, began his international career with Ireland but made the England switch in 2009.
He will play his 136th ODI for England against Ireland in Bristol on Friday, before a repeat at Lord's on Sunday.
"He's probably our greatest ever cricketer, of course we'd welcome Eoin back," said Ireland batsman Ed Joyce.
Joyce, 38, also opted to leave the Irish set-up to play for England in 2006 before returning in 2011. He does not think Morgan will ever follow suit but is hopeful Cricket Ireland can develop a team that will mean players do not have to switch allegiance in order to play "elite-level cricket".
Before England's opening fixture of what will be their longest ever home international summer, Morgan has also dismissed the chances of a return, calling questions on the matter "very cheeky", before responding that there was "no chance".
Morgan, 30, has called on his England side to stay focused for the two Ireland fixtures, as they prepare for the Champions Trophy, which begins at The Oval on 1 June.
England lost in the final of the 50-over competition to India in 2013 and Morgan believes the event holds "huge potential" this time around, with the home side made bookmakers' favourites.
"We've marked it as the halfway stage to the 2019 World Cup," said Morgan. "We're not taking this game for granted. The strength of the side we're putting out reflects that, and it's a really important summer for us - so we're taking it as seriously as any other fixture."
Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes and Jos Buttler will miss the weekend warm-up games because of IPL commitments in India but will return for the tournament, where England meet Bangladesh, Australia and New Zealand in Group A.
Durham pace bowler Mark Wood is likely to feature in Bristol as he looks to impress Morgan after having three ankle operations since last playing for England in September.
England are scheduled to play 21 matches across all forms of the game by 29 September - in addition to the Champions Trophy, which features the top eight teams in the ICC's ODI rankings.
Ireland currently sit 12th in the rankings - seven places below England - and have lost their last two matches, to Afghanistan.
Joyce says the game in Bristol is "huge" because Ireland have never played England in England before.
His side will also play New Zealand and Bangladesh twice each by 21 May and, across the six games, Joyce expects a return to the quality of play that almost saw his side qualify from their pool at the 2015 World Cup.
"It's no secret that England are huge favourites," said Joyce. "We have had a tough 18 months, there's no getting away from that. The last World Cup we played well, but since then we have had a change to the team, three or four important guys have retired and it's hard to replace them straight away with a small talent pool."
Ireland have been boosted by the inclusion of Paul Stirling and Kevin O'Brien - the hero of Ireland's 2011 World Cup win over England - in the squad, as the pair continue to recover from finger and hamstring problems respectively.
England: Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Moeen Ali (Worcestershire), Jonny Bairstow (Yorkshire), Jake Ball (Nottinghamshire), Sam Billings (Kent), Ben Duckett (Northamptonshire), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Alex Hales (Nottinghamshire), Liam Plunkett (Yorkshire), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jason Roy (Surrey), David Willey (Yorkshire), Mark Wood (Durham)
Ireland: William Porterfield (Warwickshire, capt), Andrew Balbirnie (Leinster Lightning), Peter Chase (Leinster Lightning), George Dockrell (Leinster Lightning), Ed Joyce (Sussex/Leinster Lightning), Tim Murtagh (Middlesex), Andrew McBrine (NW Warriors), Barry McCarthy (Leinster Lightning), Kevin O'Brien (Leinster Lightning), Niall O'Brien (NW Warriors, wk), Paul Stirling (Middlesex), Stuart Thompson (NW Warriors), Gary Wilson (Derbyshire/Northern Knights, wk), Craig Young (NW Warriors).

article Water levels on the River Sava are expected to peak later, threatening the country's biggest power plant.
It comes after the worst floods in the Balkans for decades left more than 35 dead and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.
In Bosnia-Hercegovina, landslides have buried houses and disturbed landmines laid during the war in the 1990s.
The floods are also affecting Croatia.
Three months' worth of rain fell on the region in just a few days, causing rivers to burst their banks and sweep into people's homes.
Flood alerts are still in place in many areas of Serbia and northern Bosnia, according to the EU Floods Directive.
Twelve bodies were recovered from the Serbian town of Obrenovac on Sunday, Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said. It takes the toll in Serbia to 17.
Meanwhile at least 19 people at believed to have died in Bosnia. The authorities have warned that the death toll could still rise.
The rain has finally stopped in Belgrade, reports the BBC's Guy Delauney in the Serbian capital.
But officials fear water flowing from neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia could cause a "flood wave" on the River Sava on Sunday evening.
Emergency workers and volunteers have stacked sandbags along the river in Belgrade and other towns such as Sabac and Sremska Mitrovica.
Belgrade was basking in the Sunday sunshine, with the mercury pushing 25 degrees - just as it should be at this time of year. But on the banks of the River Sava, there was no time to relax in the shade.
Scores of young volunteers lined up along the stretch of river from Brankov's Bridge to Ada Ciganlija island - along the bicycle path which would normally be packed with weekend riders. Members of the emergency services marshalled them as they crowded around lorries delivering loads of sandbags, before passing them hand to hand, down the line.
"I came to help my country, my people, my city," said Mladen Kos, who has worked around the world in the hospitality industry. "We're waiting for the Danube river - if it rises up tonight, then the Sava river will be blocked and we will be in big trouble."
Serbia's prime minister has warned people that they cannot fight nature. But the people here are still doing all they can to stop it flooding their homes.
"We are doing all we can," said Prime Minister Vucic.
The main concern is whether flood waters could knock out the Nikola Tesla power plant, which supplies much of the country, our correspondent says.
The coal-fired plant is in Obrenovac, south-west of Belgrade, where most of the population have now been moved to safety.
Flood levels in the town dropped on Sunday, enabling officials to move people to safety by road.
There are also concerns at another power plant, at Kostolac, west of Belgrade, where the Mlava river broke through a second ring of flood protection, Tanjug news agency reports. Kostolac provides 20% of Serbia's electricity, it says,
Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic has joined calls for help.
"Support and solidarity for my people in Serbia!'' he wrote on his Twitter account.
Almost one-third of Bosnia has been affected. The north-east is worst-hit, with houses, roads and railway lines submerged.
Bosnian Serb police chief Gojko Vasic said the situation had been particularly difficult in Doboj "because the flood waters acted as a tsunami, three to four metres high", the Reuters news agency reported.
"No-one could have resisted," he said.
Humanitarian aid and technical equipment have arrived from Russia and EU countries, officials say.
Bosnian Security Ministry spokesman Admir Malagic said that about one million people - more than a quarter of the country's population - live in the affected area.
Chairman of the Bosnian three-man presidency Bakir Izetbegovic said that his country is facing a "horrible catastrophe", the Associated Press reported.
"We are still not fully aware of actual dimensions of the catastrophe," he said.

article Turkey's family minister was blocked from entering the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam as the spat between the two nations worsened on Saturday.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Mr Erdogan's remark was "way out of line".
Earlier, a rally in the city due to be hosted by the Turkish foreign minister was banned for security reasons.
Turkey has summoned the Dutch charge d'affaires to the foreign ministry in Ankara for an explanation.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu had been hoping to harness the votes of the Turkish diaspora in the Netherlands, home to some 400,000 Turks, ahead of a referendum in Turkey next month on whether to expand Mr Erdogan's powers.
Austria, Germany and Switzerland have banned similar gatherings where Turkish officials were due to speak.
On Saturday, Turkey's family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, was stopped by police as she tried to enter the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam after arriving from Germany, where she had held separate meetings.
Dutch news broadcaster NOS ran footage of the minister arriving at the consulate and being denied entry by security forces.
"We were stopped at the Consulate General of Rotterdam, 30 metres away, and are not allowed to enter," Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya wrote on Twitter.
She travelled by land to the Dutch city after hearing that the plane carrying Mr Cavusoglu had been refused permission to land.
Dutch police earlier closed the road leading to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam for security reasons.
On Saturday evening, hundreds of people waving Turkish flags gathered outside the consulate building in protest.
Dozens of supporters of Mr Erdogan stood near the entrance as police erected barriers to prevent demonstrators from getting too close.
As the crowd numbers increased throughout the evening, security was stepped up and people were later dispersed.
President Erdogan reacted to the ban on his foreign minister by threatening to block Dutch flights.
He said: "Ban our foreign minister from flying however much you like, but from now on, let's see how your flights will land in Turkey."
Mr Cavusoglu also warned Turkey would impose heavy sanctions if his visit were blocked.
Mr Rutte warned in a statement (in Dutch) that the Turkish threat of sanctions made "the search for a reasonable solution impossible".
Mr Rutte also stressed that Dutch officials had earlier discussed whether the planned rally with Mr Cavusoglu could be private and "smaller-scale" and held in a Turkish consulate or embassy.
The Netherlands "regrets the course of events, and remains committed to dialogue with Turkey," the statement added.
Analysis - Mark Lowen, Turkey Correspondent
Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a canny political operator. While his falling-out with key European allies and explosive comparisons to the Nazis may seem chaotic, it's quite possibly all planned by a man who knows he thrives as the underdog.
Sending Turkish ministers to Europe when relations with Turkey are flagging and some European states are nearing elections was never going to be warmly welcomed by the German or Dutch governments.
They rose to the bait - and it has allowed Mr Erdogan to paint this is as a conspiracy against Turkey and himself as the nationalist Turkish hero fending off the European oppressor.
That will rally his support base and the far-right nationalists he's trying to woo before the presidential referendum next month.
But it will horrify the other side of Turkey - the pro-European liberals who see their country drifting ever further from the west and their President engaging in unprecedented slander against other Nato allies.
The diplomatic row comes just days before Dutch voters go to the polls.
The election campaign has been dominated by issues of identity, the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague says.
The anti-Islam leader of the Freedom Party, Geert Wilders - who campaigned against the Turkish minister's visit - is expected to make significant gains, our correspondent adds.
Last week, Mr Erdogan accused Berlin of "Nazi practices" after a number of his rallies were cancelled, drawing a sharp response from the German government.
He is seeking to extend his powers in the 16 April vote and targeting millions of expatriate voters - including 1.4 million in Germany.
There is uncertainty about whether an event Mr Cavusoglu was due to attend in Zurich, Switzerland, on Sunday would go ahead after one venue refused to hold it.
Another event in Zurich scheduled for Friday was cancelled, as were rallies in the Austrian towns of Hoerbranz, Linz and Herzogenburg.
The Dutch and Austrian governments have criticised the Turkish government's drive to take its referendum campaign to Turks based in EU countries.
Relations between Turkey and European countries have deteriorated since last July's attempted coup in Turkey. Germany has been critical of the mass arrests and purges that followed - with nearly 100,000 civil servants removed from their posts.
Many European nations have expressed deep disquiet about Turkey's response to the coup attempt and its perceived slide towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan.
Turkey is a key partner in an arrangement attempting to limit the movement of migrants into the EU, but has threatened to "open the gates" if the EU reneges on commitments to provide aid, visa-free travel for its nationals and accelerated membership talks.

article It also saw £400m of instant access savings cash being withdrawn in a period that saw it being put up for sale before a rescue deal was agreed.
However, half-year losses narrowed to £135.2m from £177m last year.
In June, the Co-operative Bank agreed a £700m rescue package to stop itself from being wound up.
The bank said that the deal was progressing to plan and was "on track" to be completed by September.
The Co-op Bank was rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013, after bad property loans contributed to a £1.5bn hole in its finances.
In February this year, the bank was put up for sale after it was unable to reach a strong enough financial footing to satisfy Bank of England regulations.
However, the sale plan was dropped after its existing investors agreed to a rescue deal, which will see them swap their debt for a stake in the bank. The Co-op Group's stake in the bank will fall from 20% to about 1%.
Chief executive Liam Coleman said the completion of the restructuring would "secure the future of the Co-operative Bank as a viable stand-alone entity".
He also said that trading in the first half of the year had been "resilient", given the backdrop of the talks over the bank's future.
Although the bank had lost current accounts, the fall was less than 2% of its total, and it still had 1.4 million current account customers.
"The vast majority of customers have remained very loyal as we have progressed the sale and capital raise process and I am extremely grateful for their ongoing support," Mr Coleman said.
"Of course there is more hard work ahead, and, like other banks, we recognise there are risks to the UK economy, but this is a great bank and we are positive about the future."

article The software is being used to help movie makers cut the costs of planning action sequences.
The technique has already been used to "pre-visualise" scenes that were later filmed for the blockbuster Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
The team at Abertay believe it could significantly reduce the costs of preparatory work in the film business.
Technology lecturer Matthew Bett explained how "pre-visualisation" works.
Directors are able to position virtual cameras and change lenses to work out the best way to film an action sequence.
"It's a digital process of creating assets for the film, creating sets, creating camera shots mocking up, in a computer-generated way, a very early representation of what the film will be and look like," he said.
"That allows budgets to be fixed, allows directors to give creative input to the film at that stage, and allows the rest of the production to fall into line."
The team say they have succeeded in using relatively cheap games technology to do the job currently being done at huge expense in Hollywood.
"We're taking a piece of games technology and using it in place of some very expensive custom hardware that is being used by the film industry to achieve virtual production techniques," Mr Betts said.

article Annan Athletic picked up their fifth league win in a row with a 3-2 victory at Montrose.
Stirling Albion's good formed continued as they beat Cowdenbeath 2-0, while Elgin City and Arbroath played out a 0-0 draw at Borough Briggs.
The fixture between Edinburgh City and Berwick Rangers was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.
Clyde, under the guidance of stand-in bosses Peter MacDonald and Jon-Paul McGovern, fell behind to a Danny Denholm goal but MacDonald equalised from the spot and David Gormley made it 2-1.
Jim Lister levelled matters late on, despite Forfar goalkeeper Grant Adam being shown a red card.
Three first-half goals set Annan on the way to victory at Montrose. Gary Fraser cancelled out Rabin Omar's early opener, before Max Wright and Steven Swinglehurst gave the visitors a two-goal cushion. Fraser had the chance to reduce the deficit from the penalty spot but his effort was saved by Blair Currie.
Kerr Hay pulled a goal back for the hosts and Annan's Darren Ramsay received a red card late on.
Cowdenbeath's Dale Carrick had an early penalty saved by Chris Smith and his side's misery was compounded midway through the half when Ross Smith headed Stirling Albion in front. Sean Dickson secured the three points shortly after the restart.
Elgin and Arbroath's draw helps neither in their pursuit of Forfar. Ricky Little received his marching orders for Arbroath after picking up two yellow cards, whilst Elgin's Darryl McHardy came closest to breaking the deadlock when his cross struck the bar.

Other parts of Lincolnshire also saw a high proportion of Leave voters, with South Holland and East Lindsey both posting figures of more than 70%.
Remain campaigner and Conservative MP for Boston and Skegness, Matt Warman, said the decision had to be respected.
Parts of the county have in recent years seen an influx of EU workers drawn to the area's agricultural industry.
The 2011 census found about 13% of residents in Boston were born in the EU and were largely Eastern-European migrants who arrived after 2004.
One Lithuanian worker told the BBC he was "a little shocked" by the result.
"I suppose it depends what they are going to do with all the people from other countries," he said.
"I hope it will be all right, but we don't know. Now we are waiting."
Another woman, who did not want to be named, said the result was "a positive step for the country".
"Now we can be led by people who have this best interests at heart, not Europe," she said.
"It's not all about immigration, which is what every politician has made it look like, it's about other things as well."
Mr Warman added: "We've got to respect the fact that if people want to take that gamble then we have to get the best deal for the country."

Sam McQueen is set to miss the fixture because of a minor groin strain.
Long-term absentees Matt Targett and Charlie Austin will return to training later this week.
Jonathan Pearce: "This is huge. If Chelsea follow up their FA Cup semi-final win with an emphatic victory they'll hold their nerve and land the title.
"But this is a slippery one. They've found Southampton troublesome at home and the Saints have had 10 days to prepare.
"A defeat for the league leaders will open the door for Spurs.
"Chelsea were far too open in the thrilling semi-final. They also haven't gone this long without a league clean sheet in nearly 21 years.
"Southampton may not have beaten a current top-six side all season but they've looked dangerous away recently. Tricky this for the leaders!"
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte: "I have in my mind the starting 11 but tomorrow I want to check very well the physical consideration of every single player as our last game was an intense one and used energy.
"But we have trained very well this season and we have a lot of energy to face this type of situation.
"It is important for us to win and look at ourselves, but we all know that tomorrow it won't be easy because Southampton is a very good team with a good coach and good players."
Southampton manager Claude Puel on the importance of Oriol Romeu: "I think he's not far off [N'Golo] Kante. He recovers the ball so well and is a technical player.
"He's an important player for this team because he can do fantastic work to recover the ball and start the play. It's difficult for us without him.
"We will see for the future, we are confident in him and, for me, he can look to getting in the selection with Spain, for example."

article The South's military was placed on its highest non-wartime alert after the shells landed on Yeonpyeong island.
Pyongyang accused the South of firing first. The Southern military said it had conducted exercises but shelling was directed away from the North.
This is one of the worst clashes since the Korean War ended, analysts say.
There have been occasional cross-border incidents since the conflict ended without a peace treaty in 1953, but the latest comes at a time of rising regional tension.
North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-il is thought to be ill and trying to ensure the succession of his youngest son.
On Saturday, it emerged that North Korea had also shown off what it claimed was a new uranium enrichment facility to an American scientist.
The move prompted the US to rule out the resumption of six-party talks on nuclear disarmament that Pyongyang abandoned two years ago.
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called on North Korea to "halt its belligerent action", adding that the US was "firmly committed" to South Korea's defence.
An emergency session of the United Nations Security Council could be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, a French diplomatic source said.
A spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean shells had started falling in the waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at 1434 local time (0534 GMT).
At least 50 landed directly on the island, most of them hitting a South Korean military base there.  Sixteen South Korean marines and three civilians were injured.
By Jonathan MarcusBBC diplomatic correspondent
Nobody needed any reminder of the volatility of the relations between North and South Korea, nor of the sensitivity of their disputed maritime border. In March, a South Korean warship was sunk by an explosion and an investigation indicated strongly that the North was responsible.
The shelling of Yeonpyeong fits into the same pattern. From the North Korean viewpoint, this is about establishing deterrence over the South and defending its interests. But it is also a wider demonstration to the world of the North's power and an indication of some kind of political transition.
N Korea seeks attention through force
A resident on the island told the AFP news agency that dozens of houses had been damaged by the barrage. Television pictures showed plumes of smoke rising above the island.
"Houses and mountains are on fire and people are evacuating," a witness on the island told YTN television station. "People are frightened to death."
Local government spokesman Yoon Kwan-seok said the shelling lasted for about an hour and then stopped abruptly.
"All of the island's 1,600-odd residents were evacuated to shelters," he said.
The South's military fired back some 80 shells.  Casualties on the northern side are unknown.
South Korean fighter jets were also deployed to Yeonpyeong, which lies about 3km (1.8 miles) south of the disputed inter-Korean maritime border.
President Lee Myung-bak ordered the military to retaliate against North Korean targets in case of "additional provocations", his spokesman said.
Earlier, the president's office said: "North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong island constitutes a clear armed provocation."
But North Korea's supreme military command blamed South Korea for the incident.

Brief history of the Korean War
"The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong island beginning 1300 (0400 GMT)," the state-run KCNA news agency quoted it as saying.
The North would "continue to make merciless military attacks with no hesitation if the South Korean enemy dares to invade our sea territory by 0.001mm", it warned.
"It is our military's traditional response to quell provocative actions with a merciless thunderbolt."
South Korean military officials later said that it had been conducting regular military drills in the sea off Yeonpyeong before the incident, but that no fire was aimed towards North Korea.
There was more condemnation of North Korea from Russia, EU and the UK, although China - the North's main ally - refused to apportion blame.
A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry said that both countries should "do more to contribute to peace".
"What's imperative now is to restart six-party talks as soon as possible," Hong Lei told a news conference in Beijing.
Japan's Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, said he had ordered ministers to prepare for any eventuality.
"I ordered them to make preparations so that we can react firmly, should any unexpected event occur," he said after an emergency cabinet meeting in Tokyo.
Russia's foreign minister warned of a "colossal danger", and said those behind the attack carried a huge responsibility.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says news of the incident has caused concern on international financial markets, with both the Korean won and Japanese yen falling, but there is no sign of panic in the South Korean capital.
This western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line, has been the scene of numerous clashes in the past.
In March, a South Korean warship went down near the border with the loss of 46 lives. International investigators say a North Korean torpedo sank the ship, although Pyongyang has denied any role in the incident.
Since then relations between the two neighbours have remained tense.

article He told BBC Radio 5 live he had "used words I wouldn't normally have used".
His comments came after Germany appeared to rule out David Cameron's plan to limit EU arrivals in the UK.
Labour called the remark "desperate", while the Liberal Democrats said they were "not based on the facts".
Speaking in the House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr Fallon had been "absolutely right" to correct himself.
"It is right for politicians to raise concerns about immigration but we should always choose our language carefully," he told MPs. "He said this morning he wished he had chosen his language in a different way and I agree with that."
The prime minister made the comments in an update to Parliament about last week's EU leaders' summit, during which the UK was told it must pay an extra £1.7bn to the 28-member group. Mr Cameron has refused to do so.
The European Commission has argued the contribution revisions were calculated by independent statisticians using a standard formula agreed by all member states.
Mr Cameron's Conservative Party is facing a difficult by-election in Rochester and Strood, Kent, called after one of its MPs, Mark Reckless, defected to the anti-EU UK Independence Party.
Mr Cameron faced tough questions from Conservative MPs over immigration when he spoke in the Commons.
Official figures published in August showed UK net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving - went up by more than 38% to 243,000 in 2013-14,  with EU citizens accounting for two-thirds of the growth.
It has been reported the UK could seek to apply an "emergency brake" to stop EU migration after it reached a certain level or to limit the number of National Insurance numbers issued to new arrivals.
Speaking to the Sunday Times, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to rule this out, saying there could not be "tampering" with the EU principle of free movement of people.
This prompted Mr Fallon to say parts of the UK felt "under siege" from migrant workers and overseas benefit claimants and that some could be "swamped".
Labour and the Liberal Democrats criticised the comments and a government source said: "He accepts he should have chosen his words better."
Mr Fallon confirmed this, telling BBC Radio 5 live: "I misspoke yesterday, I used words I wouldn't normally have used."
Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he added: "I was a little careless in the words I used yesterday. I accept that.
"What I meant was there's huge pressure on the system now, on schools, housing and social services."
For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Mr Fallon's claim that communities were being "swamped" reflected "the desperation of the Conservative Party". "You have got to be responsible always in the language that you use around issues of immigration," he told Sky News.
Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: "I've worked with Michael Fallon and I really respect him but I think those comments are more based on the Conservative concerns of the UKIP threat in the Rochester by-election than they are based on the facts."
Mr Cameron also faced questions over the European Arrest Warrant, ensuring the quicker transfer of criminal suspects between EU nations, when he speaks.
Some Conservative MPs argue the UK should reject it, arguing it undermines the national sovereignty over justice, but the government says it is vital to ensure terrorists, sexual offenders and murderers are dealt with promptly.
The Commons is expected to vote on the issue at about the time of the Rochester and Strood by-election, with Mr Cameron possibly facing a rebellion from his own MPs.

article Kelly Brewster, from Sheffield, died in the attack at the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on Monday.
Her uncle Paul Dryhurst said 32-year-old Ms Brewster had "heroically shielded" her 11-year-old niece from the blast in the foyer.
Her partner Ian Winslow confirmed on Facebook Ms Brewster had been killed.
More on this and other Yorkshire stories
Mr Winslow wrote: "Not sure how this works but it isn't good news.
"Kelly Brewster wasn't one of the unidentified hospital patients.
"She has sadly passed away in the terror attack yesterday.
"Kelly really was the happiest she has ever been and we had so many things planned together.
"My daughter Phoebe will be absolutely devastated like we all are."
Ms Brewster, a former City School pupil, who worked for Irwin Mitchell Solicitors and insurance company Aviva, had been to the Ariana Grande concert with her sister, Claire Booth, and her sister's 11-year-old daughter.
The family say Ms Booth and her daughter were both being treated in hospital.
Close friend Alix Bingham said she was struggling to come to terms with news of Ms Brewster's death.
"It hurts every time I see her face on TV or on Facebook, it brings it back home that it had really happened and it's not something I can wake up from," she said.
"She was amazing. She was one-in-a-million. She was so happy and loving. She loved life and everyone in it. She was very close to her sister and absolutely loved both her nieces."
Neighbour Irene Mcilhagga said: "I can't get over it. I can't even think about it.
"I've known her since she was a little girl.
"She was very kind. She would help anybody."

article Abeer Jones from Abergele, Conwy, said new rules meant her mother was not eligible for a humanitarian visa.
Mrs Jones told BBC Wales she could afford to support her mother and had shown proof to officials.
The UK government said applications were considered on individual merits.
Mrs Jones' mother Hayat Ghajar, 70, lives in a bomb-damaged apartment in Aleppo with her two other daughters.
Mrs Jones spoke to BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme on the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of civil war in Syria, saying: "I don't want anything from the government.
"I've been here for 10 years and I've never claimed a penny. I will give my mum half of my meal, I will give her my bed and I will sleep on the floor.
"I'm worried sick about them. I can't stop worrying about them."
Mrs Ghajar is only allowed to apply for a six-month visitor visa, but officials have refused to grant one to her and her daughters.
The family said it was because officials do not believe they can financially support themselves, or that they would return to Syria.
However, Mrs Jones said she provided documents proving she could support the three women.
The programme will show mobile phone footage filmed in Aleppo of the family dealing with electricity, food and water shortages, and fears of further attacks.
Mrs Jones' sister Dania Abozlam said: "It's very cold and I'm very worried about my mum because it's very cold here and we don't have electricity, and we feel very frightened.
"When I go [to work] sometimes I feel afraid. Sometimes I feel I won't be coming to my home. Maybe I will die."
The programme also caught up with Asmaa Al Fashtaki, who arrived in the UK illegally while five months pregnant.
Her son was born in Cardiff, and she waited a year to be reunited with her husband Yasin.
She said: "I know I am coming to here illegally and I said I am very sorry I do that.
"Because we don't have another choice - we are in the war and we should go out of my country. I will be a good woman and my husband will be a good man. We will work and make everything good for this country."

article The developer Sirius Minerals said the go ahead had been given by the government for the port facilities at Teesside docks.
It will be linked to the mine by a 23-mile (37km) long tunnel.
The company said the mining operation would create more than 1,000 jobs, but opponents fear it will damage the landscape and wildlife.
Chris Fraser, managing director and CEO of Sirius Minerals, said he was "delighted to have secured this final approval for the project".
"Our team is currently actively engaged in the financing phase of the project and I look forward to providing further updates in due course," he added.
Plans include building a minehead at Dove's Nest Farm, Sneaton, with shafts 4,921ft (1,500m) deep.
Potash is used in fertilizer and mining is expected to begin in 2021. The company aims to initially produce 10 million tonnes of fertilizer per annum, rising to 20 million tonnes subject to council agreement.
Planning approval for the mine was granted by the North York Moors National Park Authority in June 2015 with "stringent conditions" for its construction and working.
The Campaign for National Parks said the mine was "completely incompatible with national park purposes" and the promised economic benefits would "never justify the huge damage" to the area's landscape, wildlife and tourism.

article Brian Sharp, 55, of Manor Road, Folkestone, was told he would serve at least 18 years for murdering Tim Clayton in the Kent town last November.
Sharp's trial at Canterbury Crown Court heard he had become jealous about 45-year-old Mr Clayton's close friendship with his on-off girlfriend.
His victim was asleep behind a building when Sharp began his 12-minute attack.
Kent Police said Sharp, accompanied by his Staffordshire bull terrier, had attacked Mr Clayton as he slept at the rear of Europa House in Pound Way in the early hours of 9 November.
Sharp punched and kicked Mr Clayton for 12 minutes, before leaving the scene.
CCTV showed Mr Clayton, a father of two, getting up and checking himself in a car window before returning to go to sleep.
He was found unconscious several hours later by bank staff arriving for work and died in hospital the following day.
After the guilty verdict last week, Det Ch Insp Paul Fotheringham said: "This was a violent, callous and premeditated attack on a vulnerable man in the middle of the night.
"Sharp became consumed by jealously after learning of his girlfriend's friendship with Mr Clayton and he went out that night to hurt him.
"Mr Clayton didn't have a chance."

article The firm has announced a limited refresh of the machine, the first time it has upgraded its innards since 2013.
But it said it would not be able to release a "new model" until an unspecified point after 2017.
The tech firm had faced criticism that it was not addressing the needs of its professional users.
It released a new line-up of MacBook-Pro-branded laptops in October, but was attacked for not including more powerful graphics cards in them and for removing several of the ports found in earlier models.
One expert said the latest announcement would reassure graphic designers, video editors, scientists and other power users that Apple was not abandoning them to focus on iPads and iPhones, which outsell the Macs.
Apple's engineering chiefs told a small group of journalists - which did not include the BBC - that the company had been constrained as a consequence of how it had expected graphics chip technology to develop.
The firm had believed it would become more common to use multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) to carry out complex tasks. The Mac Pro was designed to use two in parallel.
Instead, component-makers have focused on designing parts that maximise the output of a single GPU and give out more heat as a result.
This caused problems for the trash-can-like design of the machine. It did away with the multiple heat sinks and fans found in earlier Mac Pros, and instead used a single triangular piece of aluminium to conduct heat away from its processors, helping it to run more quietly as a result.
"The way the system is architected, it just doesn't lend itself to significant reconfiguration for somebody who might want a different combination of GPUs," Techcrunch quoted Apple's hardware chief John Ternus as saying.
"We realised we had to take a step back and completely re-architect what we're doing and build something that enables us to do these quick, regular updates and keep it current and keep it state of the art, and also allow a little more in terms of adaptability to the different needs of the different pro customers."
The firm's software engineering chief Craig Federighi added: "I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner... being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate."
The refreshed models add more powerful CPU (central processing units) and dual-GPUs than before. But otherwise little has changed, including a lack of USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports common to Apple's other high-end systems, which offer data speed benefits.
"I think it was simply untenable for Apple to continue to remain silent on the Mac Pro front," commented the tech blogger John Gruber, who was also invited to the meeting.
"No matter how disappointing you consider today's speed bump updates to the line-up, they're certainly better than no updates at all.
"[But] if they had released these speed bumps without any comment about the future of the Mac Pro, people would have reasonably concluded that Apple had lost its... mind."
This is the second time in a week that Apple has been in the news because of GPUs.
On Tuesday, Imagination Technologies - the British designer of GPUs for its smartphones and tablets - revealed that Apple planned to go it alone and design its GPUs in-house.
In basic terms, a CPU calculates single sets of instructions more quickly (or two sets of instructions simultaneously if a dual-core chip is involved), while GPUs specialise in carrying out many calculations at the same time.
This makes GPUs better suited for "parallelisable" tasks - jobs that can be broken down into several parts and run simultaneously because the outcome of any one calculation does not determine the input of another.
As the name suggests, powering graphics is one example, but others include speech recognition and pattern matching.
Apple released the last version of its top-end desktop computer way back on 19 December 2013, but opted not to update it at its latest event.
The "trash can" was targeted at video editors, 3D graphics artists, engineers and other professionals who wanted a powerful workstation.
But three years is a very long time to go without a refresh, and a lot has happened in both tech and beyond in the interim.
To give an idea of how long it's been, all the events below have occurred since the computer went on sale:

article They were members of a commission set up by Pope Francis to help reform Church finances.
Officials believe they passed records of its discussions to journalists investigating Vatican corruption.
The documents form the basis of two new books on the controversial state of the Vatican's finances.
One of the journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi, was involved in a previous leaks scandal at the Vatican, when Paolo Gabriele, butler to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, was found guilty of stealing and copying documents from the Pope's desk.
Gabriele was given a jail sentence but pardoned by Pope Benedict.
The Vatican has called the latest incident a "serious betrayal of trust".
Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda, a 54-year-old priest, and Francesca Chaouqui, 33, were both arrested by the Vatican gendarmerie at the weekend.
The Vatican has a recurring problem with secrets and leaks.
In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI's butler leaked documents which depicted infighting at the highest levels of the Church.
Some believe that this contributed to Benedict's decision to step down the following year.
Pope Francis promised a new kind of administration. Four months after his election, he created a commission designed to end mismanagement within the Curia, the bureaucracy of the Church in the Vatican.
By ordering a clean-up, the Pope inadvertently created material for a new round of leaks.
The Vatican now accuses two commission members of passing records of its discussions onto journalists.
Despite his best intentions, Pope Francis now faces the publication of details embarrassing to the church he leads.
His 88-year-old predecessor, retired to a converted Vatican convent, will sympathise.
Challenge to Pope as 'gay lobby' talk fills Vatican
Synod sows confusion among Pope's faithful
Ms Chaouqui was released on Monday after she agreed to co-operate with investigators.
But Monsignor Vallejo Balda, a senior member of the Vatican's Prefecture for Economic Affairs, is still being held in a prison cell.
The two books, due to be published this week, are expected to reveal allegations of financial mismanagement as well as the extent of resistance to Pope Francis's attempts to reform the Vatican.
Renowned L'Espresso journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi has entitled his book Avarice: Documents Revealing Wealth, Scandals and Secrets of Francis's Church.
Meanwhile, Gianluigi Nuzzi's publisher, Chiarelettere, has said his book includes details of private meetings between high Vatican officials and the Pope.
According to the publisher, "you can hear Pope Francis, elected only three months before, as he strongly attacks the nomenklatura that for years managed the finances of the Holy See, denouncing: 'The costs are out of control, there are traps here'."

The 34-year-old aims to win his first Commonwealth Games gold medal on Thursday, two years after those feats.
"It was nice people saying 'it changed my life' and hearing things like 'the Wiggo effect'; that was a positive.
"From a personal point of view, there's been times I wish I'd never done all that," he told BBC Sport.
"I left for the Tour de France that year relatively unknown in the general public's eyes. When I came back, for a week or so I felt like the most famous man in the country.
"It's quite hard that level of fame, when you just want to do normal stuff with the children, things like that. That was hard but I think you learn to deal with it."
In an exclusive interview, the 2012 BBC Sports Personality of the Year, who competes for England in the team pursuit in Glasgow, also revealed that:
Just 10 days after becoming the first British rider to win the Tour de France, Wiggins won his fourth Olympic gold medal, and a then British record seventh medal in all, in the time trial in London.
"You can plan physically to try to win the Tour but I could never plan for what was going to happen after it," he recalled.
"It just went mad for a bit. Looking back now you don't fully appreciate it at the time, you just try to take it in your stride… and drinking and stuff to try to ease your way through it.
"It was massive really. I can't really put it into words how much it changed everything.
"Talking to people like Chris Hoy really helped, because he went through a similar thing after [the 2008 Olympics in] Beijing. You realise that it's not just you."
Wiggins, who says his son Ben "loves Mark Cavendish and is really inspired by him", only decided to compete on the track at the Commonwealth Games once his omission from Team Sky's Tour de France line-up was confirmed in early July.
"I was always going to do the Commonwealths, but I was only going to do the time trial [originally] after the Tour de France," said Wiggins.
He says Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford suggested reverting to the track as an alternative.
"As soon as he said it, I thought that was the next best thing really," added Wiggins. "I got straight back in the velodrome and training with the guys.
"The last six or seven weeks since I've been back on the track have just been really refreshing and a good distraction from all of that Tour de France nonsense.
"It's given me another focus rather than just lolling about at home feeling miserable."
Wiggins will be competing at his third Commonwealth Games, having won silver in the team pursuit at the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur, aged just 18, then claimed silver in both the team pursuit and individual pursuit at Manchester in 2002.
"It's one of the few things missing from my collection," he said. "Being in Scotland, it's almost a home Games and there's always a nice feeling with that.
"So it'd be nice to come away with a gold and put that with the rest of them, 16 years on from the first one."
But it is at the Olympics and on the road that he has enjoyed most of his success.
He won team pursuit gold at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, after which he began to concentrate on road racing, albeit with a brief return to the velodrome for the 2010 World Track Championships in Manchester.
His main career goal now is to win a fifth Olympic gold medal - which would equal Sir Steve Redgrave's British record - in Rio de Janeiro, as well as the prestigious Paris-Roubaix one-day classic, in which he finished ninth in April.
"I'd love to win Paris-Roubaix," he said. "Then it'll be a nice way to end my career in Rio on the track, the way it all began for me.
Media playback is not supported on this device
"The track was always something I was going to come back to. It was my first love.
"I feel like I was born to ride the track. My dad was a professional track racer. It's in my genes and my first memories as a baby were in a velodrome.
"If I am to compete with this team in Rio - which is what I want - I'm going to have to give it the time necessary. The guys have got so fast and the event's moved on.
"I didn't want to take it for granted that I could just come back in with a couple of weeks of preparation and be able to do it. This gives me a chance to see where I'm at and see what I have to work on."
With the end of his career in sight, Wiggins says further success is merely "a bonus" having surpassed his own expectations at an early age.
"I'm pretty content with what I've achieved," he said. "I never imagined years ago I'd achieve all of this. Cycling's given me everything and if I had to stop tomorrow I'd be content.
"I remember when I got my first [Olympic] medal in Sydney in 2000. We got bronze, I was 19, and I walked away from there thinking 'if I never do anything else, I've always got an Olympic medal'. Everything else is a bonus really."

article Two men were found guilty of murdering Tony Fisher while another two were cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter.
Mr Fisher, 58, was beaten and stabbed at his home in Carlton, Nottinghamshire, on 8 January 2016.
His wife Elaine and son Andrew found his body the morning after.
"It was immediately apparent on seeing the lifeless body of my husband that Tony had suffered a violent death," said his wife.
"It was all your worst nightmares and an image that can never leave my mind.
"To know his last moments on this earth were filled with fear and pain has been something all of Tony's family have struggled to both comprehend and cope with."
Mr Fisher co-operated with the robbers by telling them where two safes were, but they still continued attacking him.
They fled with between £10,000 and £14,000 in cash and other valuable items including jewellery, leaving Mr Fisher to bleed to death.
In a statement issued through police, Mr Fisher's family stressed that he did not know the men who killed him, and he was targeted because they "got wind" that he kept his life savings in the house.
Mr Fisher spent 27 years working as a maintenance worker at Duncan Macmillan House, a mental health treatment centre in Nottingham where his colleagues have placed a plaque in his memory.
It was estimated Mr Fisher was subjected to the assault for 15 to 20 minutes.
Addressing Palmer at Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Justice Jay called him the "ringleader of this enterprise".
"You are the sort of man who does not hesitate to use extreme measures to compel others to act against their will," he said.
He said Mr Fisher was overpowered, physically restrained, then attacked with his own kitchen knife.
"I am sure that the man with the knife was you, Simon Palmer," the judge said.
As he was being taken away by dock officers, Palmer shouted "I didn't do it", and was later heard to shout "I'm an innocent man."
The judge called Marcus Barton a "career criminal" and said he was responsible for recruiting his son, Jaydon Roberts-Barton, and his distant cousin, Nathan Barton.
Mr Justice Jay said Marcus Barton had shown no remorse, and the decision to recruit his son was "both perplexing and sad".

article Theresa May will set out measures to boost cooperation between the UK and the Gulf kingdom to tackle extremism on a visit to the capital Amman on Monday.
She will also discuss supporting the country with the influx of refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria.
The prime minister will be on a three-day trip to the Middle East.
Training will be carried out in Jordan and the UK to help its air force improve its capability to strike IS targets.
Mrs May is also visiting Saudi Arabia during her trip where the focus will be on strengthening trade and security ties as Britain prepares to leave the EU.
She said it was "clearly in the UK's security and prosperity interests" to support Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
"To tackle the threats we face from terrorism and from geopolitical instability, we must meet them at their source," she said ahead of the visit.
Mrs May said Jordan is on the frontline of "multiple regional crises" and working with the kingdom would help "keep British people safe".
"Likewise in Saudi Arabia: we must never forget that intelligence we have received in the past from that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK," she added.
Saudia Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East with goods and services exports totalling Â£6.6bn in 2015.
Britain supports and has helped arm the Saudi-led coalition fighting rebels in neighbouring Yemen.
The government has been criticised for its involvement with Saudi Arabia due to the deaths of civilians and a continuing famine in the region.
There has been pressure from MPs from across the political parties for a rethink of British policy.
Mrs May's visit to Saudi Arabia will reopen thorny questions over support for human rights, says the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar.

article Of 481 regular on-air presenters at the BBC, Sky, ITN and Channel 5 who are over 50, just 26 of them are female.
The report was compiled by the Older Women's Commission, which was set up by Labour's shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman.
Ms Harman said the figures showed "a combination of ageism and sexism... that doesn't apply to men."
The figures showed that 30% of TV presenters are over 50, a figure that roughly corresponds to the 34% of the UK population aged 50 and above.
Of the TV presenters aged over 50, however, 82% were men.
When it came to the TV workforce both on and off screen, only 7% are women over the age of 50.
Miriam O'Reilly, who successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after she was dropped as a presenter on Countryfile, said the figures "raise the obvious questions of where have all the older women gone and why did they go?
"Was it their choice to leave their jobs, or was it a decision forced upon them?"
Following O'Reilly's case, a report by the Creative Diversity Network found that TV viewers were largely satisfied with the portrayal of different age ranges in the media
But it showed some concern across all age groups about the lack of middle- and older-aged women on television.
Harriet Harman said it was an "encouraging first step" that broadcasters had been open in providing the statistics.
The Labour deputy leader owill be holding a round table with broadcasters in the House of Commons on Thursday.

article The identities of those reportedly killed on Sunday have yet to be given.
But they are thought to be the first to have been killed in that way since the jihadist group seized the ruins in May.
IS has destroyed two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers at Palmyra, one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world.
The group believes that such structures are idolatrous. The UN cultural agency, Unesco, has condemned the destruction as a war crime.

Understanding sadness at loss of sites
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, cited local sources in Palmyra as saying that on Sunday IS militants tied three detainees to Roman-era columns and then blew up the structures with explosives.
An activist from Palmyra, Khaled al-Homsi, said IS had yet to tell locals the identities of the three individuals or say why they had been killed.
"There was no-one there to see [the execution]. The columns were destroyed and IS has prevented anyone from heading to the site," he told the AFP news agency.
Another activist, Mohammed al-Ayed, said IS was "doing this for the media attention".
After overrunning the ruins of Palmyra and the adjoining modern town, also known as Tadmur, IS militants used the ancient theatre for the killing of 25 Syrian soldiers.
They also beheaded archaeologist Khaled al-Asaad, who looked after ruins for 40 years, after he reportedly refused to reveal where artefacts had been hidden.
Earlier this week, IS posted images online purportedly showing militants driving a tank over a captured soldier, who it alleged had himself driven over militants.

article In 2015, former mayor Boris Johnson said the change from an Olympics arena to a football stadium would cost £272m, a figure which has now risen to £323m.
The investigation will look into inherited issues including the cost of moving the retractable seating.
A stadium expert has said the ground should be knocked down and rebuilt.
Paul Fletcher, who has built or advised on more than 30 new grounds, said it should be rebuilt as fans are too far from the pitch.
The club declined to comment when contacted by BBC Sport.
A spokesperson for the London Mayor said: "The mayor is deeply concerned about the finances of the Olympic Stadium, which have clearly been left in a total and utter mess by the previous administration at City Hall.
"Sadiq has ordered a detailed investigation into the full range of financial issues surrounding the stadium."
Part of the reason for the increase is a rise in the cost to install and operate the retractable seating, which can be removed for concerts and athletics events.
The cost of £8m a year is up from an estimated cost of £300,000 because the company originally contracted for the job had gone bust, reports BBC sports editor Dan Roan.
It means stadium operators London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and the London taxpayer will need to pick up the additional costs, with Premier League side West Ham contributing £2.5m-a-year rent, plus the one-off £15m for the conversion cost.
Sir Robin Wales, Mayor of Newham - the borough which co-owns the stadium after investing £40m - said he "fully supported" the call for an independent review into the rising costs.
"We have a duty to taxpayers to scrutinise this," he added.
John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: "For too long the details of this shabby deal were kept in secret and lacked proper scrutiny so Sadiq Khan is absolutely right to look again at the case.
"It's now down to those in charge of the inquiry to get to the bottom of how West Ham were gifted the deal of the century while ensuring their investigation doesn't end up costing the taxpayer as much as the stadium."
West Ham won the bid to occupy the Olympic Stadium in March 2013 and played their first game there in August 2016, after 112 years at Upton Park.
However, their move has been marred by fan violence, leading the club to issue a five-point security plan to prevent further disorder.
Dan Roan, BBC sports editor
It may have been the centrepiece of London's glorious 2012 Games, but the story of the Olympic Stadium is becoming more and more troubled.
Last year, the BBC revealed West Ham were getting the running costs of their new home paid for them. Now its suitability as a football venue is under fierce scrutiny because of disorder at matches. A proposed naming rights partner has walked away, while there is renewed focus on the finances of a stadium that has had to be built twice, at an overall cost of £750m.
The soaring costs effectively end any hope of the stadium breaking even within five years. The LLDC will try to reduce running costs and look to install more efficient hydraulic retractable seating. But the fear will be that, until then, the staging of some summer concerts and events - crucial for the stadium's finances - will be affected because of the time it takes to reconfigure the arena at the end of each season.
Once again, there will be tough questions about those originally responsible for the stadium's legacy, the remarkable deal West Ham struck, and why it was not designed for dual-use from the very beginning.

article Exhausted delegates were held up for hours in the final stage of the conference as final glitches were ironed out.
It was a typical last-minute drama in climate talks. The world is gathered to cheer a deal, then a few nations decide to dig in their heels.
This time, the US is one of the deadline delayers; it often is.
The text says developed countries "shall" take the lead in cutting emissions. US lawyers say this will never get through Congress.
"Shall" implies legally binding; the verb should be "should".
It's apparently an oversight, or a translation error. Whatever it is, it creates a moment of opportunity for other big players to find more "errors" to benefit them.
US Secretary of State John Kerry is in the thick of it. He's calling someone on his mobile phone, then handing the phone to other delegates  - with the White House presumably at the other end.
Just as "shall" is eventually being softened to "should" in a text revision, other obstacles are being raised in the chase towards the finish line.
First it is Turkey. The UN is asking it to do too much, Turkey complains. The French conference chairman Lauren Fabius promises to hear its plea later.
Then Nicaragua will not sign up. It says there is a total mismatch between what the document says is needed to protect the climate, and what it proposes to do about it.
This is true and others nations feel the same.  But they are not willing to ruin the deal to make the point.
How was this hurdle overcome? Well, it is rumoured that the Pope had to phone the president of Nicaragua to make a personal plea.
An even more outlandish rumour suggests UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had to promise to visit Nicaragua on 26 December to celebrate Christmas.
Whatever the truth of these rumours, this extraordinary deal was eventually done.
We will have to keep an eye on Mr Ban to see where he will be eating his turkey.

article The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had decided not to refer the tie-up to an in-depth investigation.
The decision paves the way for the deal's completion in August.
The merger will create Europe's second-biggest fund manager, with Â£670bn under management.
The enlarged company, to be called Standard Life Aberdeen, will be headed up by Keith Skeoch and Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert.
On Monday, investors in both firms overwhelmingly backed the merger during general meetings.
The deal, announced in March, is targeting cost savings of Â£200m a year, with about 800 jobs expected to be lost over a three-year period from a global workforce of 9,000.
In a joint announcement on Thursday, the companies said: "Standard Life and Aberdeen note the announcement today by the CMA that it has completed its review of their proposed merger and has cleared the transaction unconditionally.
"The transaction is currently expected to complete on 14 August 2017, subject to remaining regulatory approvals."

article Alan Williams was refused outline consent for the proposal at Whitmuir Hall by Scottish Borders Council's planning committee in April.
The refusal came despite planning officials at the local authority and those in its economic development department backing the plans.
A final decision on the development is expected in October.
Mr Williams' proposals were knocked back by the committee after members said there was insufficient economic justification for the proposals.
Mr Williams has lodged his appeal against the decision with Scotland's Department of Planning and Environmental Appeals.
A planning reporter is now due to be appointed to the project before carrying out a visit to the proposed site.
In 2012, the council's planning committee rejected an outline application for 28 chalets by Mr Williams.
The decision to reject the scheme was upheld the following year by a Scottish government planning reporter.

The hosts held the advantage when Tom Pett scored, but Frank Nouble levelled.
Dale Gorman's penalty and a goal from Danny Newton put Stevenage in charge, but Mickey Demetriou gave the Exiles late hope with a 25-yard strike before McCoulsky's dramatic leveller.
Stevenage manager Darren Sarll:
"The manner of the goals showcased how important set plays are in this division.
"We haven't conceded a goal by being broken down. We conceded an absolute worldy [world class] of a strike and the other two goals were from set plays.
"The players have to know that there are a few long afternoon training sessions ahead of them now to try and improve us on that."
Newport County manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"That was two points dropped if I'm honest. I thought we were the better team, created more chances and gave them two goals. All in all I am disappointed.
"The boys just showed their character again, they kept going until the end and they're going to have to do that quite a lot this season and you'll be surprised where that takes you.

article The Welsh swimmer, 25, missed London 2012 after suffering glandular fever ahead of those trials, before missing out on a 2013 World Championship medal.
A historic 2014 Commonwealth gold and maiden Worlds honour followed in 2015.
"A lot of people say 'oh you're already going to the Olympics,' but you need to perform at the trials," she said.
"Unlike last time [in 2012] the preparation has been great and I've had a solid block over in Australia training outdoors with the warmth which gives you a great boost."
With Carlin's long-term coach Bud McAllister opting to move to Australia the swimmer took the bold move to leave her base in Swansea and relocate to Bath under Dave McNulty in late 2014.
The move paid dividends with 800m world bronze in 2015 and she is edging closer to Rebecca Adlington's British record of eight minutes, 14.10 seconds - which was the former world record - in the event.
"It was nerve-wracking moving programmes to be with a new coach and setup but it was great to come away with a World bronze and two European short course golds," she said.
"It's all about the Rio Olympics though, the trials are a stepping stone and I'm excited to get racing."
In addition to the 800m she will also contest the 400m and 200m freestyle races in Glasgow.
The next major event following the trials will be the 2016 European Championships, back at the venue where she missed out on Olympic selection - the London Aquatics Centre.
"The journey since 2012 has been a rollercoaster, but I think home support will be great and the European competition is world class," said Carlin.
"It's every athlete's dream go to the Olympics and London will be great build-up.
"I just have to swim well, eat well, rest well, look after myself and hopefully that will be enough."

article Its figures show around 19 in every 100,000 women in the UK were diagnosed with the disease in the 1990s - climbing to 29 in 100,000 in 2013.
Researchers acknowledge the science behind how extra weight is linked to cancer is not clear - but say hormones produced by extra fat may play a part.
They say more studies are needed.
Around 9,000 women are diagnosed with womb cancer in the UK each year and around 2,000 women die from the disease.
Researchers say treatments have improved over the last 20 years - mirrored by better chances of survival.
But they call for more research to understand why a greater number of women are getting the disease.
Prof Jonathan Lederman, at Cancer Research UK, said: "It is worrying that womb cancer cases are going up so sharply.
"We don't know all the reasons why, but we do know that about a third of cases are linked to being overweight - so it is no surprise to see the increases in womb cancer cases echo rising obesity levels."
It's not clear exactly what causes womb cancer, but certain things can increase the risk of developing the condition.
Experts say extra fat may produce hormones and growth factor molecules that encourage cells to replicate, increasing the chance of tumours forming.
Other factors - such as a lack of exercise, age and genes have all been implicated too.
Kath Bebbington, who is 56 and from Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with womb cancer three years ago and said it prompted her to change her eating and exercise habits.
She added: "My cancer diagnosis was a wake-up call for me. It was a shock because I don't smoke, I don't drink and I walk a lot.
"And we don't know what caused the cancer but I had to admit to myself that I needed to make some lifestyle changes to lose some extra pounds I had been carrying and stack the odds in my favour for a healthy future."
Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: "We know that being overweight or obese increases our risk of some cancers which is why it's important to keep an eye on portion sizes and cut back on calories, sugar and fat in the diet."

article The England captain returned to the Saints' side in their 36-31 defeat by Leicester on 25 March.
"I've had a frustrating 18 months I suppose," hooker Hartley, 31, told BBC Radio Northampton.
"I haven't played as much rugby for Saints as I'd have liked, but playing against Leicester was a great feeling."
Due to a combination of England duty, suspensions and concussion absences, Hartley has made only 15 appearances for Northampton in the last two seasons.
But while he has no plans to end his international ambitions to prolong his club career, he is now looking forward to helping Saints' pursuit of the top four.
He said: "I want to play my best and play in the best teams and part of that is going away with England.
"I've done it for almost 10 years now and that's something I'll never give up on, but I love playing for Northampton and I want to play as many games as possible.
"With the intensity England train at, I feel fit and I felt like I played a good game against Leicester, so form-wise I feel good.
"It's just good to be back playing in a Saints shirt because it's been a while."
Meanwhile, former Saints captain Lee Dickson will join Championship side Bedford Blues as a player-coach at the end of the season.
The 32-year-old scrum-half has played 250 times for Northampton since his move from Newcastle in 2008.

The student, from Chorley, was in her second year of studying health and social care at Runshaw College in Leyland and had recently passed her driving test when she was killed.
Speaking as students across the country received their exam results, her mother Lesley said: "It made her very happy - the thought that she was off to uni to do what she loved.
"She was so excited about it because she'd wanted to do that since she was about 11.

Pen Test Partners showed the BBC how it could gain access to a Hero4 camera that appeared to be turned off, to secretly watch or eavesdrop on users, or to view and delete existing videos.
The attack relied on victims setting simple passwords which could be guessed by software within seconds.
GoPro said its security was adequate.
Ken Munro, a partner at Pen Test Partners, also said the way the cameras were set up meant that a wireless connection can unknowingly be left on after the power button on the device had been pressed to turn it off.
He showed how he could "wake" the device, turn off its recording lights, and then video-stream what the device could see to his own mobile phone.
Mr Munro said that in order to take control, a criminal would need to intercept and crack the encrypted Wi-fi key, which is set up by the user when they connect the camera to a mobile device such as a phone.
In his demo he captured the key using a laptop and some free specialist software.
To make his point, Mr Munro then showed the BBC how his firm was able to use software freely available on the internet to guess the password a user might have set.
In this case the word "Sausages" was used as the password and the software guessed it in less than one minute.
The software tries thousands of possible passwords each second, using a dictionary of those known to be most commonly used.
Mr Munro wants GoPro to actively encourage users to set stronger passwords.
"Cybercriminals are increasingly turning to cracking passwords to gain access to accounts" he warned.
"We follow the industry-standard security protocol called WPA2-PSK (pre-shared key) mode," GoPro told the BBC, in a statement responding to details of the demonstration.
"Wi-fi-enabled devices must provide the user's password to access the Hero4 wi-fi network. This is the same as other wi-fi networks using that protocol," the firm said.
"We require our customers to create a password 8-16 characters in length; it's their choice to decide how complex they want it to be.
"As is true of all password-protected devices and services, if a password is easily guessable, a user is more prone to someone predicting what it is," GoPro added.

article Delhi's 2010 Commonwealth chief Suresh Kalmadi said it would be inappropriate for him to be honorary life president of India's Olympic body.
The sports minister had described the appointment as "totally unacceptable".
Mr Kalmadi is awaiting trial on charges of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.
The Congress party politician was sacked from his Commonwealth role in 2011 and spent 10 months in jail before being freed on bail.
"I thank the Indian Olympic Association for conferring the honour of life president on me," Mr Kalmadi said in a letter to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President N Ramachandran.
"However, I do not feel that it would be appropriate for me to accept this honour at this time. I am confident that my name will be cleared and I will defer acceptance of the honour till such time."
The sports ministry had threatened to cut off ties with the IOA, if it did not reverse the offer of honorary life roles to Mr Kalmadi and another politician facing corruption charges, Abhay Singh Chautala.
Indian social media users ridiculed the offers.
"Suresh Kalmadi & Abhay Chautala have been rewarded for India's terrific performance in the Olympics over the last several years," wrote one commentator, referring to his country's poor record in recent games.
"Yes, Indian Olympic Association, let's motivate our athletes by making #SureshKalmadi their president," wrote another.
Others suggested prominent people they felt would be similarly ill-suited to influential positions because of their backgrounds, with one such tweet suggesting former porn star Sunny Leone should head India's film censors.

article The event promised to bring some big name artists to the city.
MTV is one of the world's most valuable brands with a reach into over 400 million homes.
It had been in discussion with the council to hold a mini festival in the city this autumn, with the council keen to promote the event to showcase Belfast to a worldwide audience.
But now the council says it will not be happening.
A spokesperson said: "The MTV gig planned for September is not going ahead due to a number of other competing musical events during the same month."
Councillors had agreed to financially underwrite the cost of the two day music event up to a maximum of Â£300,000.
Ulster Unionist councillor David Browne said he opposed the use of ratepayers money for such events.
"I feel that the council is sometimes very generous with incentives to bring some of these things to Belfast and Â£300,000 to me is a lot of money that could have went somewhere more important and much more deserving," he said.
"I will not be losing any sleep over the fact that this concert has been cancelled."
SDLP councillor Patrick Convery, who was deputy lord mayor of Belfast the last time MTV came to Belfast in 2011, said the timing of the event was unfortunate.
"All of these opportunities that come up from MTV, they give us a chance to promote and sell our city internationally, both across Europe and across the world," he said.
"However, when our team of events organisers looked at this, there were a whole load of other events happening in the city around about the same time so scheduling was a very important thing.
"You just can't put all of the events on in one month."

article It was a moment of pure joy: school was out for summer.
Your school bag was shoved in the back of a cupboard. School shoes went the same way. Ahead lay countless days of freedom, play and sunshine.
That used to be the case for most children - yet not all youngsters today enjoy the same.
There's school work to catch up on; a year's learning to consolidate. An 11-plus test in the autumn term, perhaps.
So - some parents argue - why not study over the holidays?
Vivienne Stiles tutors children aged between four and 16 throughout the summer.
They attend a class twice a week, and are given between 15 and 90 minutes of maths and English homework every day.
"Children's brains need to be stimulated throughout the holidays," she says.
"You can't expect them to pick up in September where they left off."
By doing work little and often, says Vivienne, children maintain the stamina and concentration built up during term-time.
Vivienne - who works for Kumon, a tutor company - says the children learn new skills, develop a strong work ethic and get into a good routine.
The proof?
She says her own daughter, now 19, went from a "good C-grade student" at the start of secondary school to getting a place at London's Royal Veterinary College, thanks in part to extra tutoring.
Mother-of-two Tanith Carey was also a big believer in tutoring.
That was until her eldest daughter, Lily, did not want to accept a school prize for science at the age of seven, saying she hated the fuss.
It was then Tanith found out about the pressure her daughter was under.
So, the maths tutoring through the holidays stopped, and Lily had more time to spend making up little worlds and imaginary characters with her younger sister, Clio.
Tanith says that, like many parents, she had been swept along in a "tide of panic".
"Competition between parents is contagious - because they fear if another child gets ahead, their child will feel left behind. So it spreads," she says.
"I think it's sad that the summer months are viewed as an extension of the academic year - a chance for kids to catch up or get ahead."
In her book, Taming the Tiger Parent, Tanith writes about the concept of a child's spark.
"It's something that every child has and is the one thing they love doing and they lose themselves in and find easy," she explains.
"Children can only find it if they are left to their own devices."
Over the summer, 12-year-old Clio has decided she wants to take photographs and turn them into an album, and compile and bake some vegan recipes.
Her sister, Lily, now 15, is going abroad on a music course - despite having GCSEs coming up.
She will also enjoy the freedom of not having to get up for school, and reading whatever books she wants, Tanith adds.
Her own summer holidays playing in the garden, making huts, and playing Cowboys and Indians, formed some of the happiest memories of her childhood.
"I think in their panic and fear about the future, parents are forgetting that some of the best learning is done through play and getting to know the physical world outside in nature.
"They are forgetting that children used to have two educations. The one they had at school and the one they had from nature."
Father-of-three and author of the Idle Parent, Tom Hodgkinson, spent his summer holidays roaming freely round parks and over rubbish dumps.
He may not prescribe rubbish dumps to children today, but does believe in giving them the space to make fire, climb trees and play with knives.
"It's about responsible neglect," he says. "Leave children alone - you're nearby but let them get on with it."
Life is overscheduled so the summer holidays should be a time to live in the moment, have fun and be creative without an authority figure lurking in the background, he says.
It teaches you self-sufficiency, the ability to entertain yourself and how to look after yourself.
"These skills may not be useful in corporate life or if you want to suck on the nipple of the state but they are if you want to be a responsible grown-up human being," he argues.
However, this summer he won't practise what he preaches. His eldest has A-levels next year so it will be Latin every morning.
"It's a one-off," he says. "You do have to work sometimes."
summary It was the first day of summer.

The club's new 61,000-seater ground is being built next to the site of their current home White Hart Lane.
Spurs played their Champions League and Europa League ties at Wembley this term but won just one of four games.
"This is an incredibly exciting time in the history of the club," said club chairman Daniel Levy in a statement.
"Wembley will be our home for a season and then we will return to what will be one of the best stadiums of its kind and the most unique in the world playing host to NFL (American football) games too - a stadium that will be key to our future growth and success."
The new stadium is expected to cost £750m but will create about 3,500 jobs in the area when it is finished, according to the club.
Spurs, who are four points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea with five games to play this season, face Manchester United in their final game at the current White Hart Lane on 14 May.
Their most recent experience of Wembley was last weekend's FA Cup semi-final, which they lost 4-2 to Chelsea.

article Organisers of the rock event, which is usually held at Knebworth Park, said they struggled to get a good line-up.
They also couldn't find a weekend which didn't clash with other events.
A statement on the festival's website reads: ""Unfortunately our last irons in the fire have just been extinguished and it's clear that we won't be in a position to run the event this year."
It was also cancelled in 2012 and 2013.
In 2012, organisers said they had fought hard to keep it going but that "a very challenging year" meant the event wouldn't have satisfied fans.
The following year, the rock festival was called off because organisers said they were unable to secure a good enough line-up of artists.
Their statement about this year's cancellation added: "We've said in the past that Sonisphere will only go ahead if we feel it is going to be good enough and that hasn't changed.
"We hope all rock fans have a great summer with all the festivals and concerts already in the calendar and we plan to see you all in 2016."
Sonisphere Switzerland is still set to go ahead on 6 June with Muse headlining.

article David Cameron said every action would be taken to restore order, with contingency plans for water cannon to be available at 24 hours' notice.
On Tuesday night, unrest spread to cities including Manchester, Salford, Liverpool, Nottingham and Birmingham.
Three men protecting property died when they were hit by a car in Birmingham.
Haroon Jahan, 21, Shahzad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, who were from the Asian Muslim community, were taken to hospital but died from their injuries.
Mr Cameron said the deaths were "truly dreadful" and offered his condolences to the men's families.
A candle-lit vigil, attended by some 200 people, took place in Birmingham for the men. The BBC's Jeremy Cooke said it was entirely peaceful.
Ladywood MP Shabana Mahmood had appealed for calm, telling a community meeting it was important people did not take matters into their own hands.
Meanwhile, rioters in Manchester and Salford have been told that they face being evicted from their council homes if they are identified on CCTV footage.
Both city councils have issued warnings that if any of their tenants or their children have been involved in violence or looting they will be "thrown out".
Greenwich Council also says it will be seeking the eviction of any council tenants if they are found to have been engaged in criminal activities.
Earlier, the prime minister said police had the legal backing to use any tactics necessary to bring the rioting across England under control, including using baton rounds.
Speaking after a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee, he said: "This continued violence is simply not acceptable, and it will be stopped.
"We will not put up with this in our country. We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets."
But Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) president Sir Hugh Orde ruled out using water cannon or baton rounds for now, saying the tactics were not suited to the current unrest.
"Water cannon are used to deal with fixed crowds to buy distance," he said.
"The evidence... is showing very clearly these are fast-moving crowds, where water cannon would not be appropriate."
He added that baton rounds would only be deployed when his officers' lives were under serious threat.
Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May told the BBC she had ordered all police forces in England and Wales to mobilise special constables, cancel leave and adopt a "tough, robust approach".
Six forces have requested assistance for Wednesday evening, according to Acpo, which is co-ordinating resources in England and Wales.
They are Avon and Somerset, Gloucestershire, Greater Manchester Police, the Metropolitan Police, Nottinghamshire, and West Midlands.
By Jon BrainBBC News, Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court
Sitting in the dock in a blue tracksuit top, the 11-year-old boy was barely big enough to see over the wooden ledge into the main body of the courtroom.
But, according to the prosecution, the child had been among the hundreds arrested in connection with the rioting in London over the past few nights.
He was the youngest to appear at Highbury on Wednesday, and admitted taking a wastepaper basket from a branch of Debenhams in Romford, which was looted by rioters.
Others brought before magistrates included a man who works in a primary school, a student and a convicted drug dealer. Nearly all will be sentenced at crown courts which have the powers to impose tougher penalties.
The 11-year-old is due at a youth court at the end of the month. Despite his tender age, he spent last night in a police cell. He's been told to observe a curfew between 18:00 and 06:00 until his fate is decided.
Analysis: Courts run all night
Earlier, Mr Cameron said: "We have seen the worst of Britain, but I also believe we have seen some of the best of Britain - the million people who have signed up on Facebook to support the police, coming together in the clean-up operations.
"There are pockets of our society that are not just broken, but are frankly sick.
"It is a complete lack of responsibility in parts of our society, people allowed to feel the world owes them something, that their rights outweigh their responsibilities and their actions do not have consequences. Well, they do have consequences."
The Met Police has made 820 arrests and charged 279 people in connection with violence in the capital.
In London, three courts will stay open all night on Wednesday to deal with some of the scores of people facing mainly disorder and burglary charges after four nights of rioting.
In other developments:
Mr Cameron said anyone convicted of violent disorder would be sent to prison.
London mayor Boris Johnson urged the government to reconsider its "pretty frail" plans to cut police numbers, saying the argument had been "substantially weakened" by the riots.
And Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said agreed, adding the plans needed to be reconsidered.
"It is staggering and utterly shameful if it has taken these appalling events for ministers to start waking up to what everyone else has known all along," she said.
"Cutting 16,000 officers - the equivalent of every officer on the streets of London last night - at a time like this is deeply irresponsible."
But the Home Office said the reductions in the police budget were manageable.
At a press conference, Greater Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said he had seen "the most sickening scenes" of his career, and said the force had been overwhelmed.

Some 113 people have been arrested so far over the trouble in Manchester and Salford, where hundreds of youths looted shops and set fire to cars and buildings.
He said the force was "absolutely intent" on bringing the rioters to justice and his officers were already studying CCTV.
"Hundreds and hundreds of people, we have your image, we have your face, we have your acts of wanton criminality on film. We are coming for you, from today and no matter how long it takes, we will arrest those people responsible," he said.
In the West Midlands, 163 people had been arrested by Wednesday morning, and police chiefs say at the height of the disorder it was at a rate of about one person per minute.
Chief Constable Chris Sims said it was "another very difficult night" in Birmingham and across the region, with gangs of up to 40 people and "limited disorder" in West Bromwich and Wolverhampton.
The riots first flared on Saturday after a peaceful protest in Tottenham over the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan, 29, by police.

The sender had written on the bottom of the envelope, posted on 6 December: "Good luck with that postie."
"It took four days to reach us... really quite impressive," Mr Wren said.
"In July 2013 we moved up to Lowestoft and sent out our new address in Christmas cards," he told the BBC.
"Obviously some of those cards must've gone missing and our friend and ex-colleague clearly has lost our new address but remembered we were moving to somewhere near the sea in Suffolk."
He tweeted Royal Mail and the Post Office to thank them for their efforts in ensuring the card was delivered.
The former colleague who sent the card had not yet been made aware they had received it, he added.

article The Bears reported a turnover of £14.3m for the financial year ending September 2016, down from £18.3 million.
Pre-interest and tax profits, known as EBITDA, dropped from £3.7m to £785,761.
But the club say that this was expected to be a lower-profit year due to hosting a relatively unattractive Test match at Edgbaston, against Pakistan in early August, which did not sell out.
Edgbaston accommodated more than 80,000 spectators over the five days of England's Test match win - short of their 25,000 a day capacity.
But they did sell out for both the one-day international against Sri Lanka - and T20 Finals Day.
Chief executive Neil Snowball said: "We expect to see EBITDA* and bottom line revenues grow significantly over the next three years as Edgbaston hosts up to 28 days of major match cricket."
As well as hosting five Champions Trophy games, Warwickshire will again have a Test match this summer, the first ever day-night Test in England against the West Indies, in August.
They will remain T20 Finals Day hosts in 2017 and 2018, when they also host a Test against Sri Lanka.
And, in 2019, they are scheduled to stage an Ashes Test match, as well as five matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup.
"The club is entering one of the most exciting periods in its history," added Snowball. "Our thanks go to our principal stakeholders, the England & Wales Cricket Board and Birmingham City Council.
"Whilst we have an outstanding allocation of major match days in the next three years, we are working hard to develop our off-field commercial opportunities."
*EBITDA stands for Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (the reduction of the value of an asset).

article The International Telecoms Union predicts that subscriptions will pass seven billion early in 2014.
There are currently 6.8 billion mobile subscriptions and 7.1 billion people.
The ITU World in 2013 report also found that more than a third of the global population are online.
The Commonwealth of Independent States, the alliance of countries formerly in the Soviet Union, has the highest mobile penetration with 1.7 subscriptions for every person.
Africa has the least, with 63 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.
"Every day we are moving closer to having almost as many mobile cellular subscriptions as people on earth," said Brahima Sanou, director of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau.
"The mobile revolution is 'm-powering' people in developing countries by delivering ICT applications in education, health, government, banking, environment and business."
But in some countries, such as India, mobile growth is slowing.
The report also found that 2.7 billion people, almost 40% of the world's population, are online.
Europe has the highest penetration (75%), followed by the Americas (61%). Asia has 32% of its population online, Africa 16%.
ITU secretary-general Hamadoun Toure said the progress was "extraordinary" but that more needed to be done.
"Two-thirds of the world's population, some 4.5 billion people, is still offline," he said.
"This means that two-thirds of the world's people are still locked out of the world's biggest market."

article That is the total amount that claims management companies charged clients to process their complaints.
MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said they were disappointed the money did not go to the victims of the scandal.
Their report said this amounted to "a failure of regulation and redress".
Consumers can complain directly to the Ombudsman free of charge - yet so far, 80% of those who have done so, have chosen to go through claims management companies, which take up to a third of any money paid out.
Since April 2011, more than £22bn has been paid out in compensation to those who were sold the insurance policies by banks, but did not necessarily need them.
Members of the PAC were critical of the role of the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Treasury.
It said they, and others, were too slow in taking responsibility for the situation and "too passive in allowing it to happen".
The committee said it was also concerned about future potential mis-selling - for example, with people who have accessed money from their pension savings.
The Treasury said it would respond to the report formally in due course.
In the meantime, a Treasury spokesperson said: "The government's position is clear. The mis-selling of financial products is wrong and the victims of mis-selling must receive the compensations due to them."
For its part, the FCA said it was considering the recommendations in the PAC's report and welcomed its point that "central to preventing mis-selling is firms having the right culture".
"We remain focused on culture and will continue to encourage and cajole the industry as it delivers cultural change," an FCA spokesman said.
"Firms' culture and governance is one of the priority areas set out in our business plan. However, it is right that firms themselves take the responsibility for setting, shaping and maintaining their own culture, one with the interests of consumers at its heart."
The FCA is still considering whether to impose a deadline for all PPI complaints.

article Traditionally youngsters have been sent to after-school classes run at madrassas, where they learn to read and write Arabic and recite verses from the Koran.
The madrassas are sometimes attached to mosques or Islamic centres but can also be in a person's home.
An estimated 250,000 Muslim children attend about 2,000 of these religious education establishments in the UK.
But increasingly parents are turning to online service providers who teach children how to recite the Koran using Skype.
Listen to Rahila Bano's report on learning the Koran online on the BBC Asian Network Reports at 13:00 BST and 17:00 BST on Wednesday 6 June.
BBC Asian Network Reports
Humza Rana, who is eight, eagerly logs on to the computer in his living room, closely watched by his mother.
He enrolled on a course run by the Faiz-e-Quran Online Academy, three years ago.
He receives three 30-minute sessions a week of one-to-one tuition with a qualified Islamic scholar based at a centre in Pakistan.
The lesson is conducted over Skype but without the video and using software that displays pages of the Quran. He reads the verse and is corrected by his tutor if he makes a mistake.
His father, Fawad, says it is an excellent service and, as they live on the outskirts of Birmingham several miles from their nearest Islamic educational institution, it is the best way for his son to learn.
Mr Rana says: "If we took him to a madrassa it would take two hours in the traffic and when he got home, it would be time to eat and then go to bed. It's a quality service at a premium price and we can monitor him at the same time. My five-year-old son is now also a pupil."
He says his son has made excellent progress. He has almost completed reading, in Arabic, the 30 books of the Koran.
Saima Bibi, from Sheffield, chose the same route for her 10-year-old daughter.
She says: "It's very time consuming, you have to bring the child home from school and then take them out again and it's hard. I also work and I prefer her to be taught in the comfort of her own home, it is much safer."
News of the online service providers spreads by word of mouth and relatives or friends can often vouch for the quality of the education provided.
But there is concern that some of the hundreds of online teachers, who are often based in Pakistan, Syria, Egypt and elsewhere, hold radical views and could indoctrinate their pupils.
One online service, Easy Qur'an Memorising, is run by a former member of a banned terrorist organisation. Mian Shahzib was a student activist for Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) in Pakistan, an organisation proscribed by the UN.
But, speaking to me on the phone from Lahore, he denied he was still involved with them.
Mr Shahzib says: "I don't talk about jihad, I don't talk about any organisation. I just teach the Koran and nothing else. I am a simple preacher man."
He says he had been a student activist but no longer had any contact with JuD.
There is no evidence he was ever involved in criminal activity.
Imam Salim Ghisa, from the Iqra Education Centre in Preston, is worried about some of the online providers.
The Iqra centre is a modern madrassa with desks and chairs, interactive whiteboards and other up-to-date teaching aids. It aims to recreate the schooling experience a child has in the classroom.
Mr Ghisa says: "Largely, with Islamic teachings and statements, a lot of it is up to interpretation. That is why we have different interpretations by extremists, they throw a different slant on to a verse from the Koran, so the same verse can be interpreted by a modernist or a traditionalist and have a different meaning."
Sultan Chaudhri, the owner of one online service, Faiz-e-Quran, believes the onus must be on parents to research education providers.
He is a former army colonel and has 47 British children on his books.
Mr Chaudhri says:" Anything which is said by our teachers is recorded by our IT server and we sometimes monitor this. Also, our tutors are all in one small room and are supervised so whatever is said is said in front of everyone. We also encourage parents to take a keener interest in what their child is learning. We find it helps them to complete the course faster."
The Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB) is a self-regulatory body for about 500 madrassas and mosques in the UK.
Director, Mustafa Field, said:"At this stage, there is little evidence to suggest that Muslim pupils are in danger of being radicalised. What we would say is that children should get a holistic education. They must be able to critically analyse what they are reading and what they are taught."
It is not known if any British youngsters have been led astray through online services run by radicals but it is clear there is concern among some Muslims that it could happen.

article Paint has been part of the Windows operating system since its release in 1985 and is known for its simplicity and basic artistic results.
Paint's successor, Paint 3D, will still be available.
The list was issued as part of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, which rolls out in the autumn.
Microsoft says that features on the list will be either removed from Windows 10 or "not in active development and might be removed in future releases".
Other features facing the axe include the Outlook Express email client, which is replaced with the built-in Mail app, and the Reader app, which will be integrated into Microsoft Edge.
The BBC has contacted Microsoft for comment.
People have expressed disappointment at the news on social media, with many tweeting "RIP" messages.
Welsh YouTuber Chaotic described Paint as "the greatest thing to have ever existed" - perhaps with tongue in cheek.
The artist known as Jim'll Paint It uses the program to create artwork on outlandish themes, commissioned by strangers. He has nearly 700,000 followers on Facebook.
"Paint hasn't been all that since they messed about with it anyway. I'm running XP on a virtual machine because it's the best one," he tweeted.
"They should just release the source and make it public domain," tweeted games developer Mike Dailly, creator of Lemmings and Grand Theft Auto.

article The prime minister described IS as "sick terrorists" who he pledged would be defeated.
A video was released on Saturday showing the beheading of a US aid worker and 18 Syrian prisoners.
Earlier Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons the killing of American Abdul-Rahman Kassig demonstrated the "deadly threat" faced by the UK.
Mr Kassig - known as Peter before he converted to Islam - became the fifth western captive beheaded by IS in recent months.
The father of a British man thought to be pictured in the video has denied it is his son.
Ahmed Muthana said 20-year-old Nasser Muthana was not among the uniformed jihadists seen in the footage.
Meanwhile the Ministry of Defence said it had carried out further air strikes against the militants in Iraq.
It released a video which it said showed a single RAF missile strike on an IS communications vehicle.
Appearing in the Commons after discussing the West's response to IS at the G20 in Australia, Mr Cameron said: "We will not be cowed by these sick terrorists. They will be defeated and they must face the justice that they deserve.
"The threat is faced by countries right across the world. We must face it together."
Mr Cameron said new legislation aimed at tackling British citizens going abroad to fight with the militants would be introduced in the next two weeks.
The Counter-Terrorism Bill would give police new powers to seize passports, stop suspects from travelling, and to stop Britons returning to the UK "unless they do so on our terms", he said.
Mrs May said Mr Kassig's murder, and the recent attack on the Canadian parliament, were reminders of "the very deadly threat we face from terrorism at home and abroad".
She told MPs: "That is why protecting the British public remains this government's number one priority and why we're taking urgent action to ensure our police and intelligence agencies have all the tools they need to keep people safe."
Labour leader Ed Miliband said the latest beheading was another demonstration of IS's "evil ideology" that reinforced "our determination" to defeat the militants.

Tizzard, who also trains Thistlecrack and Cue Card, has three of the first four in the Gold Cup betting.
Ballyandy landed the Betfair Hurdle and Altior also won to cement his place as favourite for Cheltenham's Arkle Chase.
Aidan Coleman was a late call-up for Native River after regular jockey Richard Johnson pulled out because of illness.
But it was business as usual for the Hennessy Gold Cup and Welsh National winner, who is now 4-1 (from 9-2) for the Gold Cup behind 7-4 favourite Thistlecrack, with Cue Card and Djakadam at about 7-1
Coleman said of Native River: "He's just the perfect racehorse and (it was) very nice to have a sit on him and I wish them all the best for the future."
Paul Nicholls said his runner-up Le Mercurey had run well to get close to a horse he considers will win the Gold Cup on 17 March.
The champion trainer believes Le Mercurey will be a Grand National contender in the future, but will this year aim him at the Betway Bowl at Aintree.
Last year's Cheltenham Champion Bumper victor Ballyandy, trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies, won for the first time over hurdles as he beat Nicholls' Movewiththetimes.
Nicky Henderson's Altior coasted home by 13 lengths from Fox Norton in the Betfair Exchange Chase, registered as the Game Spirit Chase.
BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
One of those days where it's hard to come up with a lead story but Altior's success in the old Game Spirit Chase probably shaded it.
Last season's Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner looks even more supreme this year, and this was the smoothest of performances, all the more meritorious because it came on unfavourably soft going.
He's rightly a hotter and hotter favourite for the Arkle (his pretty much certain target said Nicky Henderson), and he'll be a Festival banker for many. Native River's style is all about stamina and toughing it out, and he'll set a big test for all-comers in the Gold Cup.

article And among the venues this year is the headquarters of the Salvation Army - which is marking its own 150th anniversary with a series of shows.
Given its own history in music - and in music halls - it is an apt setting.
Music has long been the trademark of the Salvation Army - and with a community centre in the heart of Edinburgh's Fringe - it seemed the obvious festival venue.
The music is eclectic - but more contemporary than classic brass band. And don't expect any hymns.
Marjory Watson is a singer, and a member of the church. She has programmed a mini festival of music in the Salvation Army's community centre in the Pleasance.
She said: "If there's something big going on, why not be a part of it? It's such a waste to have a building here and not to use it, and so it's really the perfect place and the perfect opportunity, just to be in Edinburgh at this time and to use all the talents at our disposal as well."
It's all very apt given the Salvation Army's roots in 19th century London. Set up in 1865, its mission was to help the poor. Like an army, its members wore uniforms, sang battle hymns, and dispensed soup, soap and salvation.
They also targeted popular music halls of the day, and 150 years later it remains their ethos in Edinburgh and beyond.
For Lisa Lewis, senior vocal teacher at Perth College, the venue offers a perfect platform for her students.
She said: "It'll be a good opportunity for my students because it's a different setting for them.
"It's important for them to learn to deal with that when you're performing, to have an audience that's very focused on you and not mulling through a crowd or have other things going on in the background. So that's particularly good for them."
Competition is tough on the fringe, but the Salvation Army are a hardy bunch - and Marjory believes that venue 405 is a much-needed addition.
She said: "What Salvation Army has always tried to do from its early beginnings is to try to be relevant to the society it finds itself in.
"Sometimes it's got that right, other times it's got a little bit lost. I think being in the festival is relevant to what's going on just now. Hopefully the music and the performances that will be given will be relevant to the people who come in our door.
"Hopefully it will be more than four people and a dog. I know that we've sold some tickets so that's really encouraging. I think the average audience is four for the festival so if we've got more than that we're doing better."

Tom Harding, who was teaching a student in the microlight at the time, said the other plane was flying too fast.
An Airprox Board report found there had been a "serious risk of collision".
Mr Harding, a flight instructor with Flight Sport Aviation, said the Citation had been flying at a speed of 240 knots (276mph).
On spotting the other aircraft, he was able to "execute a steep turn to the right".
Student pilot Tom McNicholas recalled: "It was extremely close to us.
"You could make out the whole jet... I just couldn't believe that we got that close."
The Airprox Board said "providence had played a major part", and assessed the risk as Category A.
It said members were perplexed that the jet's onboard collision avoidance system had not triggered an alert.
They also questioned whether it would have been better had both pilots been talking to a radar controller.
Mr Harding has been commended for his robust lookout and appropriate evasive response.

article Three consecutive Olympic Games appearances, a World Indoor silver medal, European Championship bronze and British records are the rewards - the achievements that justify the physical sacrifice.
But what happens when the success begins to dry up? The distances tumble, the crowds and venues decrease, while the body deteriorates and recreating the buzz becomes harder.
"I've jumped in front of 70,000 people, gone to Diamond League events in front of 50-60,000 people, it's the equivalent of being a Premier League footballer," Tomlinson, 34, told BBC Tees.
"You're going around the world - New York, Monaco, Rome - big stadiums and financial incentives and then suddenly you're struggling to make the cut.
"It's like going from the Premier League to the Third Division."
That decline in Middlesbrough native Tomlinson's performances was compounded by a bout of glandular fever from which his form has not fully recovered.
Ultimately, it led him to announce his retirement on Twitter on the eve of the British Championships in Birmingham, where he finished fifth and received a warm reception from the crowd.
"I can pinpoint it back to last July. I jumped just under eight metres with a very ragged technique and then I hurt my groin," Tomlinson said.
"A couple of weeks after that I got glandular fever and from that point onwards I haven't jumped more than 7.60m.
"I thought it could be the last one, and I spoke to [wife] Lucia and she said, 'If you're going down there to compete, go and enjoy it and let people know the situation you're actually in'.
"So many athletes just fizzle out. For almost 15 years I've been supported around the world.
"I'm an honest bloke and if this is the last time I'm on the runway then the people who have supported me wanted to be aware."

The fine margins at elite level on the runway have gradually seen Tomlinson slide out of contention for major honours.
The injuries - knees, calves and groin to name but three - coupled with his increasing years and illness forced what was a heart-wrenching decision to call it a day before his standing in the sport was affected.
"Although my training has been good, I'm still strong in the gym and still do decent speed endurance," Tomlinson continued.
"I haven't actually been able to produce the same force off the take-off board, the same top-end speed. I've been trying and trying and trying.
"I'm 35 in September - it's probably down to a bit of old age dare I admit it. It happens to us all.
"I'm out there giving it 100% and the tape measure just isn't being pulled as far as it used to. If I'm so far off it, maybe this is the time to finish it and close a chapter even though it breaks my heart.
"I don't want to be remembered as an athlete who goes out and keeps on going and not performing."
While the feelings are still raw, Tomlinson admits he will look back on his career with mixed emotions.
"There are a lot of what ifs and regrets, but there's also a lot of satisfaction. I jumped 8.20m in nine separate seasons, which is quite a feat, but I only had a best of 8.35m.
"I had great consistency. I have medals from World Championships and Europeans but I never won a Worlds or Olympics."

article Foam used by firefighters to tackle the blaze when the plane from Luton came down, in 1999, had unsafe levels of acid in it, investigators found.
Guernsey Water, said regular tests were carried out in the years since and no contaminated water entered the supply.
Andrew Redhead, of the firm, said: "There is no danger to the public."
Tests carried out at the site showed Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which was previously used in firefighting foam, had been found to be 10 times the safe limit, Mr Redhead said.
He said: "This particular field drains down to Petit Bot and Petit Bot is a pumping station where we're able to take water quality samples.
"If the water there isn't of a satisfactory standard then we don't pump it up and over into the reservoir.
"We make sure the water quality is tested very rigorously throughout the island and I can assure you the water is perfectly safe to drink."
A Public Services Department spokesman said as PFOS was being detected in ground water they wanted to remove the soil "to protect supplies".
About 14,000 tonnes of soil, contaminated by the same chemical, at the island's airport was removed last year and placed in a sealed container in a raised grass bund outside the airport entrance as part of an ??80m airfield refurbishment.
The soil from the field, which covers an area of about 60m (200ft) by 30m (100ft) to a depth of 2m (7ft), is due to be put in a smaller container at the western end of the bund.
The Public Services Department is currently looking for a company to apply to carry out the work, which it hopes will be carried out in the late summer or early autumn during drier weather.
The chemical entered the soil when the airport fire and rescue service controlled a blaze caused by a cargo plane crashing into the field on 12 January 1999.
The Channel Express Fokker F-27 had flown in from Luton to deliver a total of three tonnes of newspapers to the island and was on its final approach when it suddenly pitched, stalled, span and hit the roof of a nearby house before crashing into the field.
Two crew members on board, Captain Martin Bulgin, 36, from Dorset and First Officer Ian Rhodes, 41, who lived in Swindon, died in the crash.
Reports at the time said it was "miraculous" no one on the ground was hurt as the owners of the house hit by the plane were in another part of the building.
A row of houses were also only several feet from the crash site.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch report, released in April 2000, concluded the crash was caused because of incorrect storage of the newspapers on board, affecting  the twin-engined plane's weight distribution.

article Police used tear gas and water cannon against demonstrators demanding the resignation of conservative President Park Geun-hye.
Tens of thousands of people of took part in the march, according to police.
It brought together various groups, including trade unions opposed to the president's business-friendly policies.
Others were protesting against plans to impose state-issued history schoolbooks, which they say whitewash South Korea's past dictatorships.
Many marchers chanted "Park Geun-hye, step down''. Security forces fired tear gas when some of them tried to break through police barricades as they moved towards the presidency.
Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, was elected two years ago.
She is pushing through controversial plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers.

article Mumtaz Member, 56, died from head injuries at her home in Holmfield Avenue, Leicester, on 12 December 2015.
Her sons - Mohammed Member and Shafiq Member - together with Shafiq's partner Fatima Patel were charged with murder but the charges were later dropped.
Police believe there are people with information who have not come forward.
They have also released CCTV images of potential witnesses who were in Holmfield Avenue on the night of 11 December and early hours of 12 December.
Det Ch Insp Mick Graham from the East Midlands Major Crime Unit said it was "a rather brutal case" and it was important to get justice for Mrs Member.
He said: "Sadly we are 12 months down the line and we are still looking at all lines of inquiry.
"We are seeking support and information from the community because I think the answer is in the local community.
"There are people that know key information who feel they can't come forward."
Det Ch Insp Graham said Mrs Member was killed in a bedroom at her home between midnight and 09:30 GMT. She was found by a family member.
He said: "I don't want people to forget that Mumtaz was a loving mother, grandmother, sister and wife, and this has devastated the family."
The Leicester Mercury said Mrs Mumtaz's family is well known in the business community which "reacted with shock" to the death.
The reward is being offered to people who contact Crimestoppers directly with information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.

article The freight train, travelling from the city of Beni Suef, hit the vehicles at a crossing about 40km (25 miles) from Cairo, they say.
State TV says many of those killed on the bus were members of an extended family returning from a wedding.
Egypt's roads and railways have a notoriously poor safety record.
Monday's collision happened near the village of Dahshur, with reports saying the minibus and two other vehicles were involved.
Local security officials told Egypt's media that the crossing gates of the tracks had been closed and the train's driver was surprised to see vehicles still crossing.
"The crossing was closed with chains, there were warning lights," Hussein Zakaria, the head of Egypt's railway authority, told state TV.
Ambulances later arrived at the scene to take the injured to hospitals. There are fears that the death toll could rise further.
In January, a train carrying army recruits derailed near Cairo, killing 19 people and injuring more than 100.
Last November, nearly 50 children died when a train hit their school bus near Manfalut, some 350km south of Cairo, after a signal operator fell asleep. That disaster led to the resignation of the transport minister.
Egypt's worst train disaster was in 2002, when a train caught fire in Cairo, killing 373 people.

article The 22-year-old was born in Manchester to parents of Libyan descent, the BBC understands.
Three of his victims have been named - Saffie Rose Roussos, eight, Georgina Callander and John Atkinson, 28.
Greater Manchester Police said the priority was to establish whether Abedi had worked alone or not.
The former Salford University student is thought to have blown himself up in the arena's foyer shortly after 22:30 BST on Monday, as fans were beginning to leave a concert by US singer Ariana Grande.
A vigil for the dead and injured was held in front of the town hall in Manchester's Albert Square on Tuesday evening.
Earlier, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins passed on "heartfelt sympathies to all the innocent people caught up in last night's despicable act", adding that specially trained officers were supporting families.
Eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos was a pupil at Tarleton Primary School, in Lancashire.
Her head teacher, Chris Upton, said she had been "simply a beautiful little girl in every aspect of the word" and was "loved by everyone".
John Atkinson was from Bury, Greater Manchester.
Student Georgina Callander, believed to have been 18, had been studying health and social care at Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire.
The wounded, who include 12 children aged under 16, are being treated at eight hospitals across Manchester.
Several people are still missing, including Eilidh MacLeod, 14, from Barra in the Outer Hebrides, 15-year-old Olivia Campbell, Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19.
Eilidh's friend, Laura MacIntyre, 15 - who was also reported as missing - was later identified as one of the seriously injured in a Manchester hospital.
Thousands of people turned out for the vigil in Manchester and to hold a minute's silence to remember those who died.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Commons Speaker John Bercow stood on stage alongside Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Ian Hopkins.
Vigils have been held elsewhere, including in Birmingham, where the event was interrupted after a man apparently armed with a large knife and a baseball bat was detained nearby.
In other developments:
In a statement in Downing Street on Tuesday, the prime minister said the bombing had been a "callous terrorist attack" that targeted "defenceless young people".
Number 10 later said Mrs May, who visited a children's hospital in Manchester, had been updated throughout Monday night and had phoned Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at 04:00 BST to brief him.
The arena bombing is the worst terrorist attack in the UK since the 7 July bombings in 2005, in which 52 people were killed by four suicide bombers.
So-called Islamic State has said - via IS channels on the messaging app Telegram - it was behind the Manchester attack, but this has not been verified.
The director general of the security service MI5, Andrew Parker, condemned the terrorist attack as "disgusting" and said the security service remained "relentlessly focused, in numerous current operations, on doing all we can to combat the scourge of terrorism and keep the country safe".
Witnesses at the arena described seeing metal nuts and bolts among the debris of Monday's bomb, and spoke about the fear and confusion that gripped concert-goers.
Andy Holey, who had gone to pick up his wife and daughter, said: "An explosion went off and it threw me about 30ft from one set of doors to the other set of doors."
Emma Johnson, who was waiting for her children, aged 15 and 17, said: "The whole building shook. There was a blast and then a flash of fire afterwards. There were bodies everywhere."
Teenager Abigail Walker told the BBC: "I had to make sure I had my sister. I grabbed hold of her and pulled hard. Everyone was running and crying.
"It was absolutely terrifying."
The explosion happened shortly after US singer Ariana Grande had left the stage and the 23-year-old tweeted: "broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words".
Abedi, who had at least three siblings, had lived at several addresses in Manchester, including a property at Elsmore Road, Fallowfield, which was raided by police on Tuesday.
Armed police have also arrested a 23-year-old man in Chorlton, south Manchester, in connection with the attack.
Mr Hopkins said searches at two addresses had been carried out, including the one in Fallowfield, where a controlled explosion had been used to gain "safe" access.
He said Abedi had not been formally identified and so would not comment further.

article Essex PCs Jason Munns and Luke Salmon had been out on a fellow officer's hen party in June last year.
A police conduct panel found them guilty of gross misconduct after hearing they were told to leave Norwich Travelodge because of their behaviour.
PC Munns was dismissed without notice while PC Salmon was given a final written warning.
The panel chair said PC Salmon's conduct on the night in question was "just as much of a disgrace" as that of PC Munns, and could undermine public confidence in the police force.
But he added that PC Salmon "recognised the seriousness of his conduct" and had "insight into the impact of his behaviour".
He said PC Munns "failed spectacularly to measure up to the standards expected of a police officer" and that he had failed to take on board a "dressing down" he had while on probation in 2010.
Both men - who were based in Colchester - apologised for their actions at the hearing, which was told they were "dedicated officers who performed to a high standard".
The hearing in Harlow heard how the hotel's night receptionist Christopher Burnett had asked the two off-duty officers to leave.
PC Munns told PC Salmon to tell Mr Burnett - using "highly abusive" language - to "do one", and Norfolk Police was called.
The pair then ended up in a disagreement with the officers who arrived as to the powers to remove or arrest them.
PC Salmon admitted his behaviour that night was gross misconduct.
PC Munns, the son of a chief inspector, also accepted his conduct amounted to gross misconduct, though he disputed some of the allegations against him.

article Her party has won a landslide victory and seems certain to form Myanmar's next government.  Although constitutionally barred from the presidency, she has said she will be "above the president".  But what kind of leader will she make once in power?
We look at six examples from history of people who won their "fight for democracy" and made it to power. But what happened next?
Gandhi: 'You will never imprison my mind'
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known as Mahatma ("great soul"), was an astute campaigner who fought for Indian independence from British rule and for the rights of the Indian poor.
He was arrested many times by the British, and his wife died in prison shortly before he was released.
Although his campaign for independence was ultimately successful, the outcome - the two new states of India and Pakistan, divided along religious lines - was far from the united India he had envisaged.
The partition set off mass mutual killings and the chaotic migration of 10 million people.
In defending the rights of the Muslims who chose to remain in India, he made many enemies, and he was shot and killed by a Hindu extremist just months after independence.
A crowd of nearly one million people lined the route of his funeral procession and across the world people mourned the death of a global figure of peace, who never saw his dream of a united India become a reality.
Robert Mugabe: 'Only God will remove me'
A former teacher educated by Jesuits, Robert Mugabe made his name in the guerrilla war that ultimately led to the overthrow of white minority rule in Zimbabwe, then known as Rhodesia. He was arrested by the Rhodesian government in 1964 and spent 10 years in jail.
Mr Mugabe came to power in 1980 as a revolutionary hero, and this is why many fellow African leaders refuse to criticise him.
His critics accuse him of wrecking Zimbabwe. He once said that a country could never go bankrupt. Presiding over the world's fastest-shrinking economy, with hyperinflation approaching a daily rate of 100% in 2008, he tested his theory to the limit. At 91, Mr Mugabe is still president of Zimbabwe.
Cory Aquino: People Power
Maria Corazon Sumulong Cojuangco (Cory Aquino) was born into a wealthy Philippine family and married a high-flying politician, Benigno Aquino, who became the youngest mayor, youngest governor and, eventually, the youngest senator ever elected in the Philippines.
He was imprisoned in 1973 after President Marcos declared martial law, and was assassinated as he prepared for a presidential election 10 years later.
Cory Aquino led more than a million mourners in her husband's funeral procession and led calls for President Marcos's resignation. Uniting the opposition, she formed a peaceful protest movement known as People Power and emerged victorious from a snap election in 1986. The former president fled the country.
As president, she was always personally popular, although her government faced a series of coup attempts from Marcos loyalists and disgruntled military officers. She stepped down in 1992 but remained active in politics and played a major role in the ousting of President Joseph Estrada in 2001 and his replacement by Gloria Arroyo.
Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 (she lost to writer and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel) she subsequently received a number of awards for championing democracy and human rights.
Benazir Bhutto: 'I don't fear death'
Benazir Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was president, then prime minister of Pakistan in the 1970s. He ran one of the few government in post-independence Pakistan that was not run by the army. He was executed in 1979, following a coup. Benazir's two brothers also suffered violent deaths.
She followed her father into politics. Imprisoned just before his death, she spent most of her five-year jail term in solitary confinement.
Released from prison for medical treatment, Ms Bhutto began a campaign from London against the military government of General Zia. She returned to Pakistan in 1986, attracting huge crowds to rallies.
In 1988 she became prime minister after Gen Zia died in an explosion on his aircraft. Benazir Bhutto served as prime minister twice, from 1988 to 1990, and from 1993 to 1996. On both occasions she was dismissed by the president for alleged corruption.
She spent eight years in exile, but returned in 2007 when another military strongman, Pervez Musharraf, granted her and others an amnesty from corruption charges. Some in Pakistan saw her negotiations with the military regime as a betrayal.
She was killed in a bombing in 2007, a month before elections in which she was again a strong contender for power.
Lech Walesa: 'My work here is done'
Lech Walesa was one of the founders of Poland's Solidarity trade-union movement, which challenged the communist government during shipyard strikes in 1980. Mr Walesa came to symbolise the political struggle that led to the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
During his time leading illegal strikes he was arrested and interrogated many times. When later asked if he had been afraid he replied: "I'm a man of faith, I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes."
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, and in 1990 became the country's post-communist president. But his confrontational style alienated voters, and he was often accused of lacking sophistication.
In 1995 he failed to gain a second term, losing power to an ex-communist. He is still regarded by many as a hero of the anti-communist struggle and in 2004 Gdansk international airport was renamed after him.
Nelson Mandela: Father of the nation
One of 13 children, Nelson Mandela was a diligent student, but was expelled from university in 1940 for political activism.
He led the African National Congress in an armed struggle against South Africa's apartheid system, under which only whites could vote. He was arrested and charged with treason in 1956.  After a trial lasting five years, Mr Mandela was acquitted, but in 1964 he was jailed for life for sabotage.
He spent 27 years behind bars, including 18 on South Africa's infamous Robben Island. His eyesight was irreparably damaged while in prison and he contracted tuberculosis.
Freed in 1990, he won a Nobel Peace Prize and became South Africa's first black president in 1994. In office he won international respect for his advocacy of national reconciliation, and urged black South Africans to support the national rugby team, the Springboks - previously seen as a symbol of white power.
He memorably presented the trophy to the victorious Springboks captain, Francois Pienaar, when they won the Rugby World Cup in 1995.  Mandela stepped down as leader in 1999, and retired from politics.  He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2001. He died in 2013, aged 95.
At least 100,000 people saw the former president's body lying in state in Pretoria, and tens of thousands attended a public memorial for "the father of the nation".

article Richard Sandon, 52 and an RAF veteran, suffered a broken arm, fractured ribs and bruised kidneys in the attack near the River Nene in Peterborough.
Police said he was the victim of an "unprovoked attack", on Friday evening, when the man tripped over his dog's lead.  His dog was kicked but not hurt.
The attacker was described as a 6ft 2in black man wearing a khaki jacket.
Mr Sandon said he had been trying to pull Blue, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, to one side of the towpath to allow the man to pass when he tripped over the lead.
He apologised but the man responded by punching him in the face, knocking him out of his scooter, and punching and stamping on him on the ground. He also kicked the dog, police said.
Mr Sandon was treated for a broken arm, fractured ribs, bruised kidneys and has various bruises around his face and body and remains in hospital.
"I cannot understand what sort of person would attack me and my dog Blue in this way. I am a disabled man who is obviously unable to defend myself," Mr Sandon said.
"Blue is deaf and wears a high-visibility coat which states this. Neither of us were a threat to this man."
Police described the attack, which happened at about 19:30 GMT near the bridge at Railworld, as "vicious and cowardly".
"It was an appalling and unprovoked assault on a victim who couldn't defend himself."
Officers are looking for a man described as black, slim, about 6ft 2in (1.88m), in his late 20s or early 30s.
He was wearing a khaki jacket, jeans, white boot-type trainers and a peaked black beanie hat with a red, yellow and green band around it.

article They include Marines, who arrived in the past few days. US special forces are already in Syria.
Meanwhile, US-led coalition air strikes killed 20 civilians - including children - near the city, reports say.
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is to host talks with coalition members ahead of an expected assault on Raqqa.
Foreign ministers and senior officials from 68 nations and international organisations had been invited to attend a two-day gathering in Washington beginning on 22 March, the state department said.
"Secretary Tillerson has been crystal clear that defeating Isis (IS) is the state department's top priority in the Middle East," acting state department spokesman Mark Toner said.
Defence officials told the Washington Post that a Marine artillery unit had been deployed with large field guns that can fire 155mm shells about 32km (20 miles).
A coalition spokesman, Col John Dorrian, told Reuters news agency they would help "expedite the defeat" of IS in Raqqa.
Over the weekend, a separate force of elite US Army Rangers was also deployed near a town north-west of Raqqa in heavily-armoured vehicles.
The move was an attempt to end clashes between units from the Kurdish-Arab alliance, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and Turkish-backed rebels.
IS can be defeated in this war only if its militants are forced to stand and fight as a conventional army, the BBC's Paul Danahar writes from Washington.
Much of its senior military leadership is made up of former Iraqi army commanders from the Saddam Hussein era. Their instinct the last time they faced a defeat on the battlefield, during the US-led invasion in 2003, was to melt away.
They re-emerged as the leaders of militants opposing the US occupation who then joined to form an umbrella grouping which became al-Qaeda in Iraq. After the start of the Syrian civil war this morphed into IS.
What the US Marines will hope to do, working alongside US special forces, is create a net tight enough to kill or capture these men before they get away. That means co-ordinating the assault and making sure the anti-IS forces work together.
They will hope to finally force the men that the US military has been fighting for more than a decade into a last stand.
Under President Barack Obama, US special operations forces were deployed to recruit, train and advise the SDF's 30,000 Arab and Kurdish fighters. However, their numbers were limited to 503.
The latest deployment of Marines is considered temporary, so it is not affected by the cap.
Col Dorrian said the dozens of US Army Rangers who had arrived on the outskirts of Manbij, about 110km (68 miles) from Raqqa, were also there "for a temporary period".
The Rangers were seeking to "create some assurance", Col Dorrian added, following clashes between Turkish-backed Arab rebels and local fighters from the Manbij Military Council, which was set up by the SDF when it captured the town.
The Turkish government considers the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, which dominates the SDF, a terrorist group because of its links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey.
It is not yet clear but the deployment comes as President Donald Trump considers a new plan to defeat IS that was submitted by the Pentagon late last month.
The Associated Press news agency reports that Mr Trump wants to give the Pentagon greater flexibility to make routine combat decisions in the fight against IS.
Commanders on the ground were frustrated by what they considered micromanagement by the Obama administration, it adds.
The US is also said to be preparing to send up to 1,000 troops to Kuwait to serve as a reserve force that can be deployed to fight IS in Syria and Iraq if necessary.
Col Dorrian said the SDF's operation to encircle the city was going "very, very well" and might be completed in a few weeks. "Then the decision to move in can be made," he added.
Earlier this week, the SDF cut the main supply route connecting Raqqa to IS-held territory to the south-east in Deir al-Zour province.
The New York Times meanwhile cited US officials as saying there were an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 militants inside Raqqa.

article Shaun Longstaff, the former Scotland wing turned international rugby agent, might be talking about broiler chickens or beef cattle, livestock and commodities, rather than professional sportsmen.
But this is the ruthless business of modern rugby at the elite end - and the source of Longstaff's alarm.
His agency represents some of the sport's top global talent. Scotland internationals Tommy Seymour and Pete Horne, Ireland duo Conor Murray and Simon Zebo, England's Dan Cole, and Australian Will Genia are among the more illustrious names on his books.
Longstaff, 44, has seen the game change, watched players pump themselves bigger and stronger. He's observed the physical toll - the enforced retirements, the frightening and lingering symptoms of concussion.
He seeks the counsel of surgeons and scientists, and finds himself holding increasingly frank exchanges with his players about their quality of life after rugby.
And he worries about his role in it all, the path his sport is treading, and what might become of those whose careers and well-being he oversees.
Nobody had heard of Leone Nakarawa when the giant Fijian lock first pitched up at Glasgow three years ago.
Such was his astounding skill set, so utterly different to anyone else in his position in this hemisphere, that he left  the Warriors this summer a Pro12 winner, World Cup star and rugby phenomenon bound for a lucrative contract with Racing 92, the French champions.
In Paris he joins forces with one of Longstaff's clients, the preposterously proportioned Tongan-New Zealander, Ben Tameifuna, a dump-truck of a prop who tips the scales at almost 150kg (23st 8lb).
There are more Nakarawas and Tameifunas out there to be plundered, hidden gems scattered across Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, and Europe's elite want one of their own.
"Some of the clubs knew we were going on a scouting trip to the islands in April," says Longstaff.
"They weren't looking for a playmaker, or a great kicker, because you can coach a great kicker - they were looking for something they couldn't get over here.
"'Find us a freak'. Someone big and fast and powerful. And they want them cheap, because it is business, and they know if they go to the islands, where poverty is rife, you can pay very little really and get someone over who might come through very quickly."
Amid the myriad analysis tools now used in elite rugby, many sides kit their players out with wearable sensors.
The thirst for more data and enhanced intelligence is a tenet of professional sport, and these gismos measure the G-forces generated when players collide, make a tackle, or hit a ruck.
But Longstaff warns the glorification, and quantification, of the "hit" fuels a dangerous cynicism seeping into some players' psyche.
"There are coaches who openly talk about the G-force on the hits," he says. "Some coaches are now reading and comparing them, in terms of whether they're hitting that ruck hard enough, or carrying hard enough, so effectively they're picking - which kills me - connected to how hard your Gs are on your hits.
"To me, that seems mad, that it's affecting the way you look at the game. If you haven't got the ball, you shouldn't be looking to think, 'there's a dead ruck, so if I hit that really hard, my Gs are going to be really high'.
"But it comes into their heads because they want to get picked, and if they get picked for that game, they might get that new contract. I've definitely seen that taking place, which is a concern."
Some coaches, says Longstaff, go further. The chaotic and perilous 'breakdown' is an environment in which an opponent can be taken out of the game.
"The main theme is violence at the breakdown for certain directors of rugby," he says. "I've played the game, I know it's a tough game, but that is a key focus for some. That's where they think they can get that edge.
"They want guys hurting the opposition at the breakdown because it's the one chance you can really blind-side someone."
Longstaff experienced the surgeon's scalpel almost as often as he donned a Scotland jersey in his own career.
Over a decade after hanging up his boots, he says the changes in the game and the shape of those who play it now make physical damage a constant threat.
"I've had two operations on my right shoulder, one on my left, a serious operation on my right hip, three operations on my knees," says Longstaff.
"If you tell any non-rugby person the amount of operations I've had as a 44-year-old, their eyes pop out of their heads. They think it's absolute madness.
"And then I explain to them I was the wimp on the wing who couldn't tackle a fish supper - I wasn't exactly putting my body into awkward positions very often.
"Fast-forward 20 years to what these guys are doing now. It is a different world, and they're doing it regularly. Is their quality of life going to be affected long-term?
"I always tell them to go into this with your eyes wide open, because they all feel bullet-proof. They're in an environment where everyone's bullet-proof; they're so tough."
With the enhanced physicality comes a vital emphasis on recovery. But Longstaff tells of international players given until minutes before kick-off to prove themselves ready for battle.
"Maybe rugby is on a different level physically because of the way you have to put your body on the line, and the way almost every player is not 100% when he plays," he says.
"I've seen players go into Test matches where the management give them right until the final hour to prove their fitness, which we see more and more often these days.
"Is that the right thing for their bodies, long-term? It is things like that I sometimes find myself saying to players."
If all this plays out at the top end of the sport, a little way below, youngsters graft to make the physical strides necessary to carve out a professional career.
"There's a massive number of players under the age of 21, 22 that were turfed out of academies last season," notes Longstaff.
"Huge numbers of guys just get moved on. And they have been changing the shapes of their bodies for maybe six years. They would actually look quite odd walking around town now.
"You've built this body, but then what do you do with it? You've got to manage it and live with it. That's their choice - they've gone into this to get bigger, but the pressures to get bigger are huge. Because if you can't get bigger, it's such a tough road to get through."
The consensus among leading scientists and doctors is that rugby is gradually addressing the intricate threat of injuries to the brain.
Scottish Rugby's top medic, the immensely-respected James Robson, told BBC Scotland in June that awareness and willingness to take concussion seriously is "massively better" now than in recent years.
Rugby's governing bodies say that is the reason for the increased instance of concussion reported in each of the past five annual injury audits undertaken on England's Aviva Premiership.
But earlier this year, John Beattie's BBC Panorama report investigated chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a form of dementia caused by repeated head trauma. It has been found in the brain tissue of deceased boxers, NFL athletes, and now, rugby and football players.
There is also a study in progress at the University of Glasgow, examining the long-term effects of concussion in former Scottish internationals.
Meanwhile, Scotland's current fly-half Finn Russell has still to return to contact training three months after the severe head injury he incurred on Pro12 duty for Glasgow Warriors.
And just last week, in the first case of its kind, the former Sale scrum-half Cillian Willis is suing the club for alleged clinical negligence over the concussion that ended his career - a development that has some of England's top coaches fearful of the precedent it could set.
Longstaff is deeply troubled by this tumult. He, like Robson, is encouraged by the shift in mind-set, but worries his players are unwittingly part of an experimental generation.
They can't know what they're getting into since the science to tell them does not yet exist. But some are already suffering.
"I think the attitude to concussion is improving," he says. "It's more accepted and far cooler now to say, 'I'm not alright', and get off.
"That's one level. The next level is professionalism, and it's ironic, because I represent money and professionalism in the game really, and money comes into it.
"These guys are thinking, 'if I don't play, I might not get that match payment' - some players will think along those lines - or 'I'm coming out of contract, and if I don't play this game, there's a break for three weeks, and then I'm coming into negotiations, I've got to play, and I've got to play really well'.
"The kids play and have different social pressures, and the professional men play and are concerned about livelihoods.
"I wouldn't consider myself some great mind in terms of changing of the laws - I don't know the way forward, I just know that I'm worried, and have been for ages.

"I'm not sure there's a lot of knowledge there for players. I find myself sometimes offloading my own conscience a little bit - I talk to every player about their thoughts on where the game's going with regards to the protection for the brain.
"I'm their agent; I've been with some of these guys for 12 years now, so I have witnessed the physicality modern players face in the changing game.
"Have I done enough? Because if they go into their 40s and 50s with head problems - whether it's just headaches, which might be the lesser symptoms, or it's worse than that - it wouldn't sit well with me.
"I don't want to be an old man, and some of these players are 15, 20 years younger than me phoning me and saying, 'did you know about this? Because I can't remember what I did yesterday, and I can't hold down a job'."

article The Algeria international, 21, moved to White Hart Lane as a teenager, making his first-team debut in December 2013.
He has made 66 appearances for Spurs but has not featured for Mauricio Pochettino's side this season.
"I first learned of Schalke's interest six weeks ago and have been hoping since then that the transfer would be completed," said Bentaleb.
Schalke, who finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season, are also close to signing Bentaleb's former Spurs team-mate Benjamin Stambouli from French champions Paris St-Germain.
The 26-year-old Frenchman played for the Premier League club in 2014-15 before joining PSG last summer and helping them win a domestic treble.

A fire ripped through Bradford City's home ground during the 1985 match against Lincoln City, killing 54 Bradford City fans, two Lincoln fans and injuring many more.
The fire is thought to have been started accidentally by a cigarette.
Responding on Twitter, Blackpool fans said it was "totally insensitive" and showed a "lack of thought and care" but Bradford City fan Andy Walker said "no offence was meant or taken".
Kyel Reid scored the only goal of the game on Saturday as Bradford City moved to within a point of the play-off spots with victory over relegation-threatened Blackpool at Bloomfield Road.

article All stations are expected to close, with the four main Tube workers' unions supporting action.
Drivers are unhappy at pay and conditions offered for working on the new night service.
London Underground (LU) said it has offered a deal aimed at improving work-life balance.
Tube stations across the capital will close for the second time in the space of a month, following a 24-hour walkout on 8-9 July.
Services will stop running from 18:30 BST and there will be no Tubes on Thursday.
LU said the new offer included an extra Â£200 per night shift for drivers and a Â£500 bonus for station staff by next February, as well as a further guarantees for a 32-hour, four-day week.
Aslef, the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) have all turned down the offer.
Unite previously said its action "would go ahead".
BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott
The sticking point comes down to guarantees over weekend working and time off.
I'll give you an example. The unions say that a new night shift will mean a driver finishing at 8am on Sunday and then possibly starting work again on Monday morning. So the Sunday will count as their day off. They say that's not enough rest time after a night shift.
To try to reassure staff, London Underground has just sent out draft copies of what new shift-patterns might look like. It says staff will either work the same number of weekends a year, or fewer. And in the end, anyone who doesn't want to work nights won't have to.
But these talks clearly haven't been going well.
I understand the unions pulled out in the last couple of days (not permanently though). The relatively new team at London Underground is experienced in business but not in the railways, and I get the impression that there has been a bit of a culture clash over the way both sides are used to doing deals.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash claimed the night Tube plan was "rushed and botched from the off" and said his members would "not accept that their work-life balance should be wrecked to plug the gaping holes in staffing capacity that should have been dealt with from day one".
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, said his organisation had put forward "an extremely fair revised offer".
He added: "We continue to urge them to put the new offer to their members and not subject Londoners to further unnecessary disruption."
Questions have been raised over whether the dispute will be resolved in time for the night service to begin as planned on 12 September.

article There was controversy at last year's event, when some competitors said they thought the course was shorter than the stipulated 13.1 miles.
Four cyclists set off from the city's George Square at 04:30, and finished in two stages at Glasgow Green at about 07:00.
They were accompanied by a police escort whose job was to stop traffic.
The riders' bikes were equipped with specialist measuring equipment.
The course should be 13.1 miles, but after last year's event, some runners said they thought it was up to 200 metres shorter.
That difference could be crucial for professional runners - including last year's winner Callum Hawkins, who also set a new course record.
If the course is found to be a different length, it mean's the winner's record, and that of all the other runners, could be in doubt.
The riders cycled the full half-marathon course, including going through a darkened Pollock Country Park.
The time and date were kept secret in advance, chosen in order to allow the officials an unimpeded ride.
The results of the measuring exercise will be announced on Monday by the run organisers, The Great Run Company.
