article Many thousands of others have risked their lives this year, fleeing conflict and instability in Africa and the Middle East, in small, often decrepit vessels in an attempt to reach European territories.
But the number of fatalities has risen dramatically in a matter of months. More than 2,200 lives have been lost since June, the UN refugee agency UNHCR believes.
That is because of the big increase in numbers crossing the Mediterranean. While some 60,000 reached European shores in 2013, so far more than 130,000 have arrived in 2014.
The majority of migrants head for Italy, prompting a crisis that the country's navy, coast guard and beleaguered immigration facilities are struggling to handle.
Last October, 366 people died off the Italian island of Lampedusa when the fishing boat they were travelling in from Libya capsized.
Nearly all the victims were Eritrean. Migrants crossing in the central Mediterranean - from Libya and Tunisia - have until recently come mostly from Eritrea and Somalia, although increasing numbers of Syrians fleeing the country's civil war are also making the journey.
Libya has become a popular starting point for many journeys, with people traffickers exploiting the country's power vacuum and increasing lawlessness.
The relatively short distance to Lampedusa encourages more people to risk the journey.
Migration charities believe that as many as 20,000 people may have died at sea trying to reach Europe in the last two decades.
Malta's prime minister warned after the Lampedusa tragedy that the Mediterranean was in danger of becoming of a "cemetery" for desperate migrants.
'Age-old' issue
The number of people using the various routes across the Mediterranean has ebbed and flowed.
From 2008-2012, large numbers of migrants crossed between Turkey and Greece via the so-called Eastern Mediterranean route, border management agency Frontex reports.
In response, Greece bolstered border controls with an additional 1,800 police officers.
However, Frontex suggests that the area remains problematic, and points to "uncertainties related to the sustainability of [Greek] efforts, and evidence that migrants are waiting in Turkey for the end of the operation".
Over the last decade, the central Mediterranean route has experienced periodic surges in migrant traffic.
UNHCR figures suggest that some 25,000 people fled to Italy from North Africa in 2005, a number which dwindled to 9,573 in 2009.
In 2011, this figure rocketed back to some 61,000, driven by the conflict in Libya which culminated in the downfall of Col Gaddafi.
Earlier in the decade, the most popular route was from West Africa to Spain, including its North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla, and the Canary Islands, with some 32,000 irregular arrivals in 2006. This figure had dwindled to just 5,443 by 2011.

article Full-back Halfpenny, 26, is out of contract with Toulon at the end of the season and is weighing up his options.
Blues coach Danny Wilson says they cannot offer the highest wages but would be able to ensure Halfpenny is in "peak" condition for Wales.
"The best interests of the player internationally would be at the front of our minds," said Wilson.
Halfpenny, who made 87 appearances for the Blues between 2008 and 2014 , would be a strong contender for a national dual contract (NDC) if he returned to Wales after spending two years in France.
The salary on such a deal would be funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), with the region paying the rest.
In return for the financial support, the regions agree to limit the number of appearances the player makes to suit the needs of the national side.
Wilson believes the prospect of being managed in that way would be a major attraction for Halfpenny, whose career has been blighted by injury, including missing the recent Rugby World Cup.
"The design of the central [NDC] contract is to get our best players playing and staying in Wales, and therefore the management of those players has to be a huge selling point," he said.
"Between us and the strong relationship with the Welsh Rugby Union, the player gets the management he wants to peak and perform for Wales.
"That's the idea of it and that has to be a selling point from a regional relationship. The other selling point we don't have is the same money as other people have to offer."
Scarlets have also voiced their interest in the British and Irish Lion, while Premiership side Wasps have been strongly linked.
Both are likely to be involved in the top tier of European competition next season, the Champions Cup, whereas the Blues are set to be in the second tier Challenge Cup.
If Halfpenny wants to return to Wales, the binding agreement between the WRU and the Welsh regions gives the Blues first refusal as the region that developed him.
"If Leigh does make a decision he wants to come back to Wales, I'd like to think Cardiff Blues would be high on his list of considerations," said Wilson.
"I'd imagine all four regions would like to have Leigh Halfpenny playing for them.
"A calibre of player like Leigh Halfpenny will have many options, whether that's regions, clubs over the bridge, clubs in France.
"There are a number of players we are talking to - players we are in the process of finalising conversations with and we'll see how things pan out."

article The claim: The UK can make itself energy self-sufficient in renewables.
Reality Check verdict: This is not the policy in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which pledges to get 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Being self-sufficient and having all energy coming from renewables would require considerable development of storage technology to avoid having to use non-renewable sources or energy bought from overseas as back-up sources.
It came after he had said: "If it is simply for hair shirt, muesli-eating, Guardian readers to solve climate change... we're all stuffed."
Becoming energy self-sufficient in renewables is not current Liberal Democrat policy, although Mr Farron described it in a speech in February as being a "patriotic endeavour".
The manifesto says the party would: "Expand renewable energy, aiming to generate 60% of electricity from renewables by 2030."
A party spokeswoman described the leader's statement in the debate as "visionary as opposed to completely literal".
The problem with being entirely self-sufficient is that many renewable sources of energy cannot generate power all of the time (the notable exception being the burning of biomass), so if you are using a very high proportion of renewables you rely on interconnectedness (buying electricity from another country where the wind is blowing), storage (batteries in the short-term, some sort of gas storage in the longer term) or a back-up system using gas-fired power stations or nuclear energy.
The Liberal Democrat manifesto talks about investing in interconnectors, which would be unnecessary if the country was to become self-sufficient.
There are already private plans in place to increase the amount of electricity that may be bought from France via interconnectors.
It may be that when he said self-sufficient he meant that we should not have a trade deficit in energy, so it would be OK to buy energy from other countries when we needed it as long as we sold the same amount to other countries when they needed it.
While there have been suggestions that marine energy could make the UK a net exporter of electricity, being self-sufficient and generating 100% of energy from renewables is considerably more challenging than, for example, 90%, mainly because of the challenges of storage.
The development of a smart grid, which co-ordinates renewable energy supplies depending on demand, may also be needed for a 100% renewable system.
Also, while the Liberal Democrat manifesto targets 60% of electricity, Mr Farron was talking about all energy, which means, for example, that all cars have to run on renewable energy and all buildings have to be heated by it.
So in 2016, the UK generated 24.4% of its electricity from renewables, but in 2015 (the latest year available) it was only producing 8.8% of energy from renewables.
The UK has an obligation under European Union rules to derive 30% of electricity from renewables by 2020, which it is on the way to achieving (although the UK is currently scheduled to have left the EU by then). But the other two parts of the targets are 12% of heat and 10% of transport to be powered by renewables, which we are less likely to achieve.
The Labour manifesto pledges to get 60% of energy from zero-carbon or renewable sources by 2030.
The Conservative manifesto looks at it in a different way, saying that "energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives".
So they say that the focus will not be on how the energy is generated but on achieving, "reliable and affordable energy, seizing the industrial opportunity that new technology presents and meeting our global commitments on climate change".
The Green Party would have a target of near-100% renewable electricity generation by 2030 with significant investment in electric vehicles and lower-carbon sources of heating.
It supports self-sufficiency and a decentralised system of communities owning their own generation systems, but would also invest in interconnectors to allow for co-operation with other countries.

article That follows an admission by VW that it had found "irregularities" in carbon dioxide emissions levels that could affect 800,000 vehicles.
It came to light as a result of an internal investigation by the firm following the diesel emissions scandal.
The UK said it was "pressing VW to provide urgent clarity".
On Tuesday, the company admitted that an internal investigation had revealed that carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption were understated during standards tests on about 800,000 cars.
VW said the issue mainly affected diesel cars.
However, on Wednesday Germany's Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the country's parliament:
"Today we were told that among the affected vehicles are 98,000 petrol vehicles".
Meanwhile the UK's Department for Transport said it "takes the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously."
"We are pressing VW to provide urgent clarity on the situation... This [CO2] development underlines the importance of the government's ongoing investigation to establish the extent to which defeat devices have been used," a spokesperson said.
VW, Skoda, Audi and Seat vehicles could be affected and the company estimates the CO2 problem could cost it about €2bn (£1.4bn).
VW had already set aside €6.7bn (£4.7bn) to meet the cost of the initial emissions scandal.
News of the issue with carbon dioxide emissions sent VW shares down by 5.6% on Wednesday.
The firm's shares have lost about a third of their value since September, when the scandal first broke.
It came to light after the US Environmental Protection Agency found VW software had detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions tests, and altered the way they operated to give more favourable results.
On Monday, US authorities also alleged that VW had fitted nitrogen oxide defeat devices on 3.0 litre diesel engines used in Porsche, Audi and VW vehicles - a claim VW denied.
Porsche also denied the allegations, but its North American division announced it is discontinuing sales of Porsche Cayenne diesel sport utility vehicles until further notice.
The carmaker is recalling 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide that were fitted with the software that circumvented tests for emissions of nitrogen oxide.
That recall is for cars with variants of the EA 189 diesel engine built to the "Euro 5" emissions standard.
Meanwhile. Volkswagen is recalling 92,000 cars in the US over a mechanical problem that could affect vehicles' brakes.
The German carmaker said part of the camshaft could shear off, causing loss of vacuum in the power brakes, which could lengthen stopping distances.
Wednesday's recall includes Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat models from 2015 and 2016. The cars have 1.8 litre and 2 litre turbocharged petrol engines.
VW discovered the problem after getting reports of camshaft failures. A fix is expected by the end of March.

article The US banking giant said net income in its corporate and investment banking division was $2.5bn, up $412m compared with the same period a year earlier.
But it also reported an after-tax charge of $487m for legal expenses.
And it set aside a total of $959m to cover bad loans, $109m higher than a year earlier.
JPMorgan's legal expenses stem in part from the fact that it still faces an investigation by the US Justice Department into its involvement in the manipulation of foreign exchange markets.
It also faces a probe into its hiring policy in Asia.
Meanwhile, Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the US, reported a 2.6% fall in profits in the first three months of the year and set aside more money to cover bad loans.
Net income was $5.46bn in the three months to the end of March ,compared with $5.61bn a  year earlier.
The bank said it was setting aside $617m for credit losses an increase of $198m on the same three months a year earlier.
JPMorgan said revenue from fixed-income bond trading rose 5% to $4.07bn, adjusted for the sale of businesses last year, including a commodities operation.
"We have an outstanding franchise which is getting safer and stronger, and is gaining market share over time," said chief executive Jamie Dimon.
"We continue to build the company for the long-term, we are investing in controls, infrastructure, systems, technology, new products and bankers."
The bank said it was increasing its second quarter dividend from $0.40 to $0.44.
JPMorgan's investment bank, along with its rivals, is under pressure to cut costs as customers have reduced their trading activity following the financial crisis.
Regulators have also demanded that big banks take fewer risks, hold more capital and improve controls.
The bank has said it wants to cut expenses by $2.8bn by 2017, excluding legal costs, though some of the savings are expected to be offset by more spending to improve risk controls.
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are the first of the large US banks to report quarterly results.
Overall, results are expected to show that low interest rates have continued to hold down profits as consumers and businesses refinance loans at lower rates.

Northern Ireland play in Nice, Lyon and Paris and the ticket allocation is linked to the size of the stadium.
The number of tickets Northern Ireland will receive is:
Applicants will be notified of the results of their application in the next few weeks, no later than 29 February according to UEFA.
The tickets will be allocated based on a priority system which takes into account the previous buying behaviour of Northern Ireland fans throughout qualifying.
Further tickets for the games will go on general sale later this year but only a relatively small amount.
About 800,000 tickets went on sale last month for fans of the 24 competing teams.
The tournament takes place in June.
summary Northern Ireland's allocation for their three group games in France is only 25,000 tickets.

article Elsewhere there's some significant action on the committee corridor, with quite a collection of Cabinet ministers appearing before various committees.
As the current crop of bills before Parliament peters out, the committee corridor may well become the focus of attention for the coming months, particularly with 30 select committee inquiries into various Brexit-related topics now under way.
Here's my rundown of the week ahead:
The Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - with any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions following at 3.30pm.
The main legislating is on the Digital Economy Bill, where there are some significant issues in play at report stage.
The government has accepted an important amendment from the former minister Claire Perry, who had heavyweight cross party backing for her call to add powers to the bill allowing the government to make internet service providers block porn websites that failed to comply with a requirement for age verification for their viewers.
The argument was that this was needed to give real teeth to the bill, and it has now been accepted by ministers, who're bringing in their own version of these powers, in a government amendment.
Labour, though, have reservations about the new government proposal and may even vote against it. And they argue that the best defence for children is compulsory sex education, starting at Key Stage 1, and will be pushing an amendment to that effect.
Watch out too for a Labour new clause, which seeks to create a procedure to deal with the growing problems of breaches of personal data security. This would create an obligation on data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner and those whose details had been compromised.
Labour also want to add in new laws to combat ticket touts and they will also be opposing the clauses transferring the policy over free BBC licence fees for the over-75s to the BBC, on the argument that the Corporation is not the appropriate body to take decisions on welfare policy. They plan to force that issue to a vote.
The Westminster Hall debate (4.30pm- 7.30pm) is on e-petition 162934 relating to child cancer - which calls on the government to make more funding available in the fight against child cancer.
The debate will be led by the Conservative, Ben Howlett, who said the petition had been brought by a couple whose child sadly passed away after a battle with a very rare cancer. Childhood cancer is the biggest killer by disease of children in the western world and currently the survival rates vary considerably between different types of cancer, age and gender. He wants to urge the government to do more to look at the funding for both research and testing new drugs for childhood cancer as well as new awareness campaigns aimed at parents.
Committee of the day is the Transport Committee hearing (4.05pm) on rail safety, which will ponder the issues around rising passenger numbers and problems, with the Rail Delivery Group, the Rail Safety and Standards Broad (RSSB) as well as the ASLEF, RMT and Unite trade unions.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) peers have another day debating the Pension Schemes Bill at committee stage - key issues include more on Master Trusts and on private pension scheme exit fees.
And the Lib Dem peer, Lord Alderdice, leads a debate on ensuring parity of esteem between mental and physical health.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with Treasury questions - followed by the day's Ten Minute Rule Bill which is on Statutory Nuisance (Aircraft Noise) -  fresh from a Westminster Hall debate on this issue, Dr Tania Mathias, whose constituency lies under the Heathrow flightpath, takes her battle against a third runway to the floor of the Commons chamber.
That is followed by the second reading of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill - a two-clause micro-measure which will raise the limit on government financial assistance that can be provided to CDC Group (formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation) (the "CDC") to Â£6bn.
This could be a micro-second reading debate as well - leaving time for opposed private business - a number of private bills (bills dealing with a private interest) have popped up from time to time, for formal approval, only to be pulled when backbench vigilantes like Christopher Chope threaten to object to them. The aim of these challengers it to get the measures debated - and this may now occur.
In Westminster Hall, my eye was caught by the debate led by Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts, on CCTV in equine slaughterhouses (2.30pm-4pm).
My committee pick is the Justice Committee hearing (9.45pm) with Prisons Minister Sam Gyimah and Michael Spurr, Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service. The current state of the prison system can hardly be avoided. Unusually this inquiry begins, rather than ends with a hearing with a minister - and its focus could well branch out in several directions, as the hearings continue.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Public Health England and NHS officials give evidence to the Health Committee on suicide prevention and whether there is sufficient support for mental health in the NHS (2.30pm).
And there's an interesting in-house encounter - the Standards Committee hearing (10am) on the MPs' Code of Conduct and Guide to the Rules. The witnesses include the MPs' main shop stewards: Graham Brady,  Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee; John Cryer, Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Angus Robertson, Deputy Leader of the SNP; plus Bernard Jenkin, Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee; Dr Sarah Wollaston, Chair of the Health Committee, and backbench standards crusader, John Mann, one of the most active complainants on standards issues (at 10.50am).
In the Lords (2.30pm) the main debate is on the economy, in the light of the Autumn Statement.
The Commons opens (11.30am) with half an hour of Welsh questions, followed at noon by PMQs.
Then, the Labour MP Justin Madders proposes a Ten Minute Rule Bill to make it easier for young people to go to games; his Football Supporters (Access) Bill deals with ticket prices and kick off times and calls for a proportion of transfer fees to be earmarked to develop facilities for local clubs and young people.
The day's main debate will be on an SNP motion - subject to be announced - and there's an intriguing looking adjournment debate from the SNP's Gavin Newlands, on Paisley's cultural contribution to the world.
And Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green will be questioned (9.30am) by the Work and Pensions Committee about his department's finances, after the cash injection in the Autumn Statement.
My other committee pick is Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's appearance before the Environmental Audit Committee (2.20pm), to talk about the environmental concerns around Heathrow expansion and the plans to mitigate air pollution, carbon emissions and noise from a new runway.
In the Lords (3pm) the main legislation is the first report stage day on the Policing and Crime Bill - this measure will probably provide the Lords' last serious legislative clashes of 2016.
There are some big issues to be fought out.
First, behind the scenes negotiations are under way to find a compromise on the provision for Police and Crime Commissioner to take over the fire and rescue authority for their area. Labour have an amendment down to delete this entire section of the bill (Clause 6), but could well be dissuaded if the government is prepared to offer stricter requirements for local consultation on such proposals - and a new government amendment on this issue has now appeared.
Compromise is less likely on Labour amendments to prevent Special Constables using CS gas and PAVA sprays, and this may be forced to a vote. There will also be an amendment on restriction on the use of police cells for those with mental health conditions
But the biggest clash may be over an attempt to add in a requirement to hold a Leveson 2-style inquiry into relations between the police and the media - as I write, no amendment has appeared but one is expected, probably fronted by a crossbench peer, but with substantial cross party support.
If passed it would probably occasion an awkward bout of parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons. And there will be plenty more controversial amendments on the next day of report stage...
As ever, on report stage days in the Lords, timing is important, and opposition amendments usually stand less chance if they're debated after the dinner break, when a lot of peers go home.
There will also be a short debate on current UK political strategy towards and plans to develop economic, security and cultural relations with Tunisia.
The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, David Lidington, setting out what will be on the Commons agenda in the coming weeks.
The day's main debates are on subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee. First is a debate on a motion on transgender equality: Maria Miller, Angela Crawley which will follow up on the first report of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, which looked at this issue.
That's followed by a general debate on the future of the UK fishing industry. An annual fisheries debate used to be a fixture of the parliamentary calendar, but since the creation of the Backbench Business Committee, the subject has had to take its chances along with many others.
In the Lords (11am) the main debates are on options for the UK's future relationship with the EU following the referendum - led by Lord Liddle, Tony Blair's former EU advisor, and on challenges in the current system of social care, proposals for reviewing and longer-term reform - led by Labour's Baroness Pitkeathley, a former chief executive of Carers National Association (now Carers UK).
The final debate is on the EU net-neutrality Connected Continent requirements, UK adult content filtering regimes and keeping children safe online.
It's private members' bills day in the Commons (9.30am) and first up is the second reading of the SNP MP Mhairi Black's Benefit Claimants Sanctions (Required Assessment) Bill, which aims to build new safeguards into the system under which claimants can be "fined" if they fail, for example, to attend a job interview.
She wants the system to take into account any caring or childcare responsibilities, the mental and physical health of the claimant and their housing situation, and to ensure that any claimants who are sanctioned are made aware of any emergency funding they could access. Expect a strong turnout of SNP MPs, but there is little sign of support from the government.
Then comes the Vehicle Noise Limits (Enforcement) Bill - from the Conservative, Kevin Foster. The bill would allow noise limits to be enforced via automatic monitoring equipment.
Further down the agenda lurks Ruth Cadbury's Income Tax (Non-Military Expenditure) Bill, which would require HMRC to record income tax revenue of people who say they have a 'conscientious objection' to public spending on defence purposes and to direct their taxes that would have been spent on the military to a 'non-military security fund'.
As the third bill on the Order Paper, it has little chance of any extensive debate.
In the Lords (10am) it's the annual Friday where the bishops get to debate the subject of their choice.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, leads a debate on the "Shared values underpinning our national life and their role in shaping public policy priorities".
Archbishop Welby has had some pretty interesting things to say on this subject - a few extracts from a recent speech give a flavour of the ground he may cover:
"It is imperative that we remind the nation that our values have not emerged within a secular vacuum; but from the resilient and eternal structure of our Judeo-Christian theological, philosophical and ethical heritage. ....The right to life, liberty and the rule of law and robust democratic government does not come cheaply, nor is it held lightly. The roots of our freedom in this country are deeply embedded within our British constitutional and civic life because their foundation lies within the shared scriptural inheritance of our faith traditions.....Democracy is not in and of itself the final answer to things, nor is the rule of law. Martin Luther King did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law is unjust. Quite rightly, Bonhoeffer in the 1930s did not accept the final authority of the rule of law when the law was palpably racist, unjust and anti-Semitic. That's one of the reasons he ended up going to the gallows. As for tolerance, it's a word like 'nice', isn't it? Completely meaningless and overused. Respect is something else - I won't go there.....Our understanding of the rights and responsibilities that flow from our God-given inheritance as human beings, enable us - Jewish and Christian communities together - to be powerful and compelling advocates for freedom in British society.
"The cutting edge of freedom must include the right to disagree, disengage and dissent. It means the freedom of others to criticise us or our views, or for those of us who hold beliefs strongly to change our minds or our beliefs. It means that we all need to be accountable to one another before God and we all need to affirm the right of others to not believe as we do. What it doesn't mean is freedom without accountability to undermine each other's faith, whether casually, incidentally or wilfully. What it cannot mean is the freedom to use language destructively and negatively about those who are different to us - or who take opinions and views with which we profoundly disagree. We have had egregious examples of that in recent weeks, aimed at our judiciary. And what it must never mean is the denial of others to practise or not practise their understanding of their religious or secular identity."

article The Co Wicklow fighter beat Victoria Torres of Mexico on a unanimous decision to make the semi-finals.
All four semi-finalists in Kazakhstan qualify for August's Olympics.
Middleweight Savannah Marshall became the 10th British boxer to book a place in Brazil by outpointing Chinese third seed Li Qian in her quarter-final bout.
Taylor, 29, who is guaranteed at least a bronze medal, impressed in Tuesday's quarter-final with a clinical display and is aiming for a sixth world title.
The Bray boxer beat Agnes Alexiusson of Sweden and Argentina's Dayana Sanchez in Astana before prevailing against Torres over four rounds.
Taylor was surprisingly beaten in the Olympic qualifier in Turkey last month.
Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna handed Taylor her first defeat in five years at the European Olympic qualifiers to leave the five-time world champion still seeking Rio qualification.
Alekseevna's victory in Samsun was Taylor's first defeat in 63 contests.
Meanwhile, Marshall, 25, will next face Dutch fighter Nouchka Fontijn for a place in the final.
Compatriot Nicola Adams kept on track for the first world gold of her career as she squeezed through against Yu-Ting Lin of Chinese Taipei in their flyweight bout.
Adams, who has already qualified for the Olympics, goes up against home favourite Ahaina Shekerbekova on Thursday, and knows she will not have to fight big rival Ren Cancan, who withdrew with food poisoning.
Great Britain's Sandy Ryan missed out on a world medal in the non-Olympic light-welterweight division as she lost on a unanimous decision to China's Wenlu Yang.

article West Midlands Police outlined the measures - which will mainly affect community support officers - as part of its efforts to save ??130m.
Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson said further cuts of up to ??30m were likely to follow.
The Home Office said crime was down 16% in the region.
West Midlands Chief Constable Chris Sims said: "We will continue to offer the protection we currently offer but people will notice the service is delivered differently.
"There will be less visibility on the streets, fewer bobbies on the beat."
Shale Ahmed from the Aspire and Succeed Youth Centre in Lozells said the changes could be "devastating".
"For a neighbourhood like this, it's about community safety," he said.
Ravi Subramanian, from the union Unison, which represents some police staff, said the service had already suffered job losses. "This further reduction will mean a scaling back of neighbourhood policing."
Mr Jamieson said: "The West Midlands has seen 24% cuts - that isn't right.
"Last week we heard there could be another ??20-30m cuts on top of this. What we cannot do is do what we were doing before.
"We are going to lose up to half of our budget by 2020.
"What people must realise is that government austerity could have a severe effect on the quality of policing.
"It's going to be policing without frills. I'm afraid it could be like some of the European forces, where it's just response policing and the other excellent work our police do could be seriously diluted."
However, the Home Office said: "There is no question that the police still have the resources to do their important work.
"What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.

article The SNP said the Ipsos Mori survey for STV was a "sensational" endorsement.
The poll also indicated that the Nationalists would win next May's Holyrood election with 74 seats.
Scottish Labour said it was focusing on what mattered and the Scottish Tories said they would continue to make a positive case for the UK.
The survey, which questioned 1,002 people last week, comes almost a year after Scotland rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%.
It is thought to be the first poll to show a majority for "Yes" among all those questioned.
Previous polls in the run-up to the September 2014 vote that showed a majority for independence had excluded those who were undecided.
Half of those questioned for STV said they would like to see another referendum within five years while 58% said they would be in favour of having one in the next 10 years.
Support for the SNP continues to be high in the wake of the party's landslide general election victory north of the border, winning 56 of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats.
The poll found that 55% of those who gave a voting intention would back the Nationalists in the Scottish Parliament constituency vote if the election was held tomorrow.
About a fifth (21%) would vote Labour, with support for the Tories at 12%, Liberal Democrats at 7% and Greens at 3%.
In the list vote, SNP support fell to 50% and backing for the Greens rose to 8%, with the preferences for the other parties remaining the same.
The SNP's business convener Derek Mackay said: "This is a sensational poll for the SNP - it shows not only that people across Scotland support us in huge and growing numbers eight years into government, but that they believe we have a strong record on key issues like health and education."
He added: "It is welcome to see support for independence now stands at over 50 per cent, as people see the SNP in government and at Westminster stand up for Scotland."
A Scottish Labour spokesman said that the party, under the new leadership of Kezia Dugdale, was changing.
He added: "We want people to take another look at Scottish Labour.
"But we know it's too early to be asking people for their votes.
"Over the coming months, we will put Labour's values first and we will focus on the things that matter in people's lives - like the standards in our schools and our hospitals."
The Scottish Conservative Party said it would "always stand up for" the two million people in Scotland who voted "No" in last year's referendum.
A spokesman added: "For its part, rather than revelling in this poll, the SNP needs to focus on the day job.
"While the Scottish government takes Scotland down the constitutional cul-de-sac, education standards have fallen and the police service set up by this SNP government just two years ago is facing breakdown.
"Scotland needs a better way forward, not a step back to yet another referendum."
The pollsters interviewed 1002 people between the 24 and 30 August.  The margin of error was plus or minus three.

article Mr Wilson was 21 when he went missing from his home in the Falls Road area of west Belfast in 1973.
He is believed to have been abducted and murdered by the IRA.
On Tuesday, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains (ICLVR) said results of DNA tests confirmed the remains were Mr Wilson's.
His body will now be released to his family.
Members of the Wilson family had just attended a walk at Stormont in memory of the Disappeared on 2 November when a call came through to say his remains had been found.
His sister, Anne Connolly, said it was a shock to learn recently that he might be buried in Waterfoot as her mother, Lily, who died three years ago, often sat on village beach.
She spoke of a "mixture of relief, and great sadness" to learn that his body had been found so soon after the dig began.
Archaeologists and other experts had been examining the beach at Waterfoot in the Glens of Antrim after a tip-off to the ICLVR.
The commission has now overseen the discovery of seven bodies and numerous searches since it was set up in 1999 to locate those murdered and buried in secret graves by republican paramilitaries during the troubles.
Remains found in County Monaghan in July were confirmed as being those of Crossmaglen man Charlie Armstrong, a 57-year-old father-of-five who went missing on his way to Mass in 1981.
In October, the remains of Mr Armstrong's neighbour, Gerry Evans, were found at a site in County Louth.

article The researchers found that pandas get by on shoots and leaves because they expend extremely small amounts of energy.
A typical adult panda burns up about 38% of the calories used by other, similarly sized animals.
The scientists found the bears' slow-moving ways were linked to low levels of thyroid hormones.
Scientists have long been intrigued as to how the black and white mammals are able to live exclusively on hard-to-digest bamboo, since their stomachs still retain the gut bacteria of the omnivorous creatures they evolved from.
This new analysis sheds light on the mystery.
The researchers looked at the daily energy expenditure of five captive pandas and three living in the wild.
They found that the creatures used around 38% of the predicted value for mammals of their size. This compares to slow-moving koalas, which use around 69% of the energy normal for similarly sized animals.
The most direct comparison with the pandas' laid-back ways were three-toed sloths, which have a similarly minimal energy consumption for their size.
When the researchers measured the panda's rates of movement they found they were only active 49% of the time, and when they did move, their average speed was a less-than-blistering 20 metres per hour.
"Pandas save a lot of energy by being frugal with the energy they spend on physical activity," said Prof John Speakman, from the University of Aberdeen and Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the study's lead authors.
"However, it is not only their low activity that contributes to their low metabolism; the metabolic rate of an active panda is still lower than a completely stationary human.
"We found that their low metabolism is correlated with very low levels of thyroid hormones, which was linked to a genetic mutation in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway that is unique to the panda."
These hormone levels were the equivalent to those found in hibernating black bears.
Pandas in captivity were even less inclined to move about, rising off their bottoms for only about one third of the time they were studied.
The researchers also discovered that the panda's brain, liver and kidneys are relatively small compared to other bears.
According to WWF, there are around 1,800 pandas left in the wild in China.
The findings were reported in the journal Science.

article The aero-engine maker, which depends on oil and gas-related customers for about 60% of its business, blamed the sharp fall in crude prices for the cuts.
The marine unit has been under pressure over the past 18 months since the price of Brent crude collapsed to six-year lows, and ship orders were cancelled.
The marine business employs about 5,800 people in 34 countries.
Rolls Royce shares jumped more than 3% following the announcement.
Mikael Makinen, Rolls-Royce Marine president, said: "After many years of strong performance through to 2013, led by good growth in the oil and gas sector, our order book and profitability have been adversely impacted by the sharp and subsequently prolonged drop in the price of oil."
The cuts will mainly be in management and back office roles, a spokesman said.
"We will be consulting with our employees and their representatives over the coming weeks and months, and expect the reduction to be completed by the end of 2016," he added.
The firm expects the cuts will generate full year savings of £40m. Investment into research and development will be stepped up.
Last November, the company said it would cut its headcount by 2,600 jobs, mainly in its aerospace division.
In July, Rolls-Royce issued its fourth profit warning in 18 months on the back of the drop in oil prices.
It said its 2015 underlying profit in the marine business would be between break even and £40m, rather than between £90m and £120m.
Rolls-Royce's new chief executive Warren East, who took up the role at the beginning of July, is in the process of carrying out an operational review of the business.

article The pavilion is the final piece of a renovation project at the former Olympic venue [1948] that began in four years ago as part of the legacy project from the most recent London Games.
Since then, refurbishment of the main 450m track, the addition of a 250m junior track and new floodlights have helped double visitor numbers.
The Herne Hill track was where Sir Bradley Wiggins began his racing career, aged 12.
Hillary Peachey, chairman of the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust (HHVT), said: "It has been a long journey, but I am immensely proud of how the community came together, matched by the generosity of our funders, the project team and the local residents."
Alongside substantial contributions from the London Marathon Charitable Trust, Southwark Council and City Hall, Sport England provided £750,000 of Lottery funds towards construction, while a recent crowdfunding initiative organised by the Friends of the HHV raised £89,000 to fit out the pavilion.
The opening of the facility was attended by Brian Cookson, president of world cycling's governing body the UCI, plus dignitaries including former sport and Olympics minister Baroness Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich and West Norwood Helen Hayes, and London's Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross,
The velodrome hosts a range of activities for different ages and abilities, including dedicated sessions for young children, women, veterans (40+) and free drop-in sessions for the disabled through charity Wheels for Wellbeing. Visit the HHV website for details of times and pricing.

article Bruce's side won the first leg 3-0 before losing 2-0 in the second leg on Tuesday to edge through to Wembley.
"We handled the occasion really well on Saturday but we couldn't put one front in foot of the other on Tuesday," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"It was a really difficult evening but we've got through."
Bruce has led Hull to Wembley three times in the last four seasons and achieved promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge.
They were relegated to the Championship in 2015 but Bruce has led them steadily up the table, finishing the season in fourth place.
"It could have been our most embarrassing night but it's not, thank the lord," he continued.
"(Tom) Huddlestone clearly wasn't fit. That was a gamble, where he played with a knock, and I shouldn't have took that gamble."
Never in play-off history has a team overturned a three-goal first-leg deficit but Derby came close on Tuesday through Johnny Russell and Andrew Robertson's own goal.
Despite continued pressure from Derby, Hull were able to hold on and secure their spot to face Sheffield Wednesday in an all-Yorkshire final on 28 May.
"I won't try and mask it up any more - we did enough at Derby, where we put in a good performance," Bruce added.
"We know we will perform better than that because we can't be any worse. Let's make sure now that we try our upmost because we have just seen our Achilles heel."

article The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said the probe was related to "financial irregularities" at the insurer.
It did not identify individuals or say if they still worked at the business.
RSA Insurance was forced to inject Â£200m into its Irish unit in 2013.
The company subsequently tapped shareholders for cash through a rights issue to help bolster its finances.
RSA's Irish unit was bailed out weeks after the resignation of its chief executive Philip Smith and after the insurer informed the market about the accounting irregularities.
Mr Smith was initially suspended after an investigation was launched into issues in the Irish unit's claims and finance functions identified during a internal routine audit.
Last month, he won a â‚¬1.25m compensation payment for a constructive dismissal.
RSA is appealing against the award.
RSA Group's chief executive, Simon Lee, also resigned in the wake of the crisis at the Irish unit. He was eventually replaced by former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester
The FRC said the investigation would cover 2012 "and relevant prior periods as a result of the identification of issues within the claims and accounting functions announced by RSA Insurance Group at the end of 2013".
RSA said the FRC's investigation was not into the company itself but into individuals who were members of accounting, auditing or actuarial professional bodies.
It said in a statement: "We understand that the investigation will therefore cover members of these professions who were employed by RSA at the  time. RSA Group will of course assist with these inquiries if requested to do so."
The FRC said it would co-operate with the Irish authorities as necessary.

Fans are set to protest this weekend after a disappointing season that has seen the Gunners' Premier League title challenge fade.
"When we built the stadium the banks demanded that I signed for five years," said the 66-year-old Frenchman.
"Do you want me to say how many clubs I turned down during that period?"
Construction began on the £390m Emirates Stadium in 2004, the year Wenger won the last of his three league titles with the club.
"The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that we have a chance to pay them back," added Wenger, who has been in charge of the north Londoners since 1996.
Arsenal topped the Premier League at the turn of the year but have since slipped to fourth, some 12 points behind leaders Leicester, who can win the title this weekend.
The Gunners were also knocked out of the FA Cup, which they have won for the past two seasons, by Watford in the quarter-finals, and their Champions League campaign again ended in the last 16 for the sixth successive season.
During Saturday's home game against Norwich, fans' groups Black Scarf Movement, RedAction and the Arsenal Supporters Trust want supporters to raise placards reading: "Time for change. Arsenal is stale, fresh approach needed."
However, Wenger said his critics had gone "too far".
He added: "I did commit and I stayed, and under very difficult circumstances.
"So for me to come back and, on top of that, (critics) reproach me for not having won the championship during that period, it is a bit overboard."
Since the end of January, Arsenal have taken only 10 points from a possible 21 in seven home league games.
Wenger said his side lost out on the title "at home against the lower teams", having played some of those games "in a very difficult climate".
He added: "We have to realise that away from home we are championship winners. At home, against the smaller teams, we dropped the points.
"It is very frustrating because we were in a position for a long, long time where we could compete for the title.
"We are disappointed but we have to fight. We have not to forget that in football you go down very quickly and you come up very slowly. We have to stick together.
"I can understand the frustration of our fans but despite that we want to support our team and the best chance you can give to a team is to be behind them."

article The bill accuses local rights groups of damaging the legitimacy of Israel's military by "branding IDF soldiers and commanders as war criminals".
It was sponsored by the hard-line party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
It follows other recent initiatives from the Israeli right, like requiring an oath of loyalty from non-Jews.
The motion to establish the commission of inquiry will now go to parliament's House Committee for debate, ahead of a full vote before the Knesset.
MK Fania Kirshenbaum - of Mr Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party - who submitted the proposal, accused human rights groups of branding Israeli soldiers as war criminals.
Israeli politics: A lurch to the right?
"These groups provide material to the Goldstone commission [which investigated the 2008-2009 Gaza offensive] and are behind the indictments lodged against Israeli officers and officials around the world," Ms Kirshenbaum said.
A series of arrest warrants for Israeli politicians and military officials have been issued in the last few years, particularly by pro-Palestinian groups in European countries.
The 41-17 vote brought a storm of protest from local rights groups, including Acri, Btselem, Adalah and the Hotline for Migrant Workers.
"Persecution and attempts at silencing will not stop us. In a democracy, criticism of the government is not only legitimate - it is essential," said a statement from Btselem, one of the organisations named in the decision.
The Welfare and Social Services Minister, Isaac Herzog, called it a "political witch hunt" suited to "shady regimes" that would damage Israel's international standing, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Israel "must be a light unto the world in terms of freedom of speech and freedom to express beliefs, and reject proposals that have the scent of McCarthyism," Mr Herzog said, referring to the 1950s communist witch hunt led by US Senator Joseph McCarthy.

article Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement that the men's contracts were not renewed when they ended in April.
However, it also said there were "no grounds to justify criminal proceedings" in the case.
The sports ministry had claimed last week that women players were forced to perform sexual favours to keep their places in the team.
Sri Lanka Cricket has not addressed this claim directly, referring instead to "the unsatisfactory situation that prevailed in the selection... and widely prevalent perceptions of favouritism and bias".
The body said that two of the officials concerned had committed "a few incidents of sexual harassment" but that "there was no evidence of any physical intimacy".
A third man had committed "incidents of improper conduct... which did not amount to sexual harassment".

Yu Tamura's conversion of Amanaki Lotoahea's 76th-minute try almost earned Japan an historic draw in a thrilling international in Cardiff.
Wales had led by 11 points in the second half after tries by Dan Lydiate, Jamie Roberts and Sam Warburton.
Wings Akihito Yamada and Kenki Fukuoka were Japan's other try-scorers.
Leigh Halfpenny scored 15 points with the boot and Japan number eight Amanaki Mafi was named man-of-the-match after a tireless and powerful display.
But it is the 23-year-old Ospreys number 10 Davies who will dominate the headlines after keeping his cool to nail his drop-goal left-footed from 30 metres in only his second international.
It was a rare moment of clarity in a Welsh performance punctuated by errors and a lack of tactical control.
Japan, with fly-half Tamura kicking superbly and Mafi simply magnificent, were worth a draw and were visibly disappointed at the final whistle.
The visitors' refusal to buckle in the face of superior Welsh possession was aided by Wales' unhappy knack of offering up points after scoring themselves.
Twice in the second half Rob Howley's team made a hash of restarts to let Japan back into the game and when Lotoahea juggled Mafi's pass to score his team's third try, it looked as though that would cost Wales dear.
Japan might even have won the game after robbing Wales of possession in the final minutes to break clear, but paid the price when they were turned over and the Welsh drove back downfield.
Howley will be looking for more control against South Africa next week.

Wales made a shambolic start and were trailing by six points and down to 14 men inside eight minutes with Liam Williams in the sin-bin.
A period of relative calm mid-half saw the home team establish forward control and Lydiate's first international try and Roberts' charge from five metres appeared to have restored order.
But far from turning the screw up front, Wales played fast and loose and were punished before the interval when Yamada pounced on Gareth Anscombe's speculative pass and raced 60 yards to score between the posts.
It was the same story after the break, with Warburton's try after great work by Alun Wyn Jones appearing to put Wales in control.
But Japan served up the try of the match through Fukuoka and then a thrilling finish after their third score.
Happily for Wales, Davies kept his head when those around him were losing theirs.

A new personnel system also allowed staff access to information on the duration of colleagues' sickness absences.
Companies House, which currently employs 904 people in Cardiff and registers the information companies are legally required to supply, said it had "an incident process in place that all staff adhere to" when a breach of data protection law happens.
In January, a High Court judge ruled that a mistake by Companies House caused a 124-year-old south Wales company to go into administration.

article Francois Hollande said it would not be finalised before Barack Obama left office later this year.
Meanwhile, Germany's economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, said it had no chance of being agreed before the US presidential election in November.
The Americans were unwilling to compromise with Europe, he said.
Mr Gabriel, who said over the weekend that the talks had in effect failed, also questioned whether the deal had any chance after the election.
"But if the Americans don't move towards the Europeans, then Europe can't agree to a 'TTIP light'. And with this, the project - at least how it was all planned for this year - has failed," he said.
The US and the European Union have been negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, also known as TTIP, for three years. Both sides had aimed to agree a deal this year.
TTIP aims to reduce or remove a wide range of barriers to transatlantic trade and investment, but has proved controversial in both Europe and America.
A spokesman for the US trade chief told German magazine Der Spiegel on Tuesday that talks on TTIP were progressing.
President Hollande said in a speech to French diplomats that France wanted to "see things as they are".
"These discussions cannot result in an agreement by the end of the year. The negotiations have bogged down, the positions have not been respected, the imbalance is obvious," he added.
The French leader's comments followed a call by trade minister Matthias Fekl to end negotiations, which he said no longer had political support in France because US negotiators "give nothing or just crumbs".
He wanted a "clear, clean, definitive stop" to the talks, which could resume if wider EU-US trade relations improved.
Mr Fekl said France would ask the European Commission to suspend the talks when trade ministers meet in Slovakia next month.
Italy's trade minister said that a TTIP deal would be reached, but the talks would take longer than expected.
Carlo Calenda said that "TTIP will be sealed - it is inevitable", adding that it was essential for Italian exporters.
The minister admitted it would be difficult to reach a deal before Mr Obama left office, but added: "We have to carry on. This accord is essential for Italy."

article The British star famous for playing Nelson Mandela and starring in The Wire, is reportedly being considered for the next 007.
The Daily Beast is reporting there was leaked email from Amy Pascal, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion pictures group.
It is reported the contents said: "Idris should be the next Bond.
Pascal was thought to be emailing Elizabeth Cantillon, the former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures - which distributes the Bond franchise.
There is no confirmation from Idris Elba or from Sony Pictures that the actor will take over to be the next 007.
The 42-year-old has previously said he would play Bond.
During a Reddit AMA in September he responded to a fan's question of whether he'd be willing to take the role, writing: "Yes, if it was offered to me, absolutely."
Daniel Craig, who is currently filming his fourth appearance as Bond in new release Spectre, is signed on to do one more film.
"I've been trying to get out of this from the very moment I got into it. But they won't let me go, and I've agreed to do a couple more," he told Rolling Stone two years ago.
Spectre is due for release in November next year.

article Tim Hughes said he listed the Series One classic on eBay to spark a discussion about its history.
The once iconic 4X4 does not have its original engine and is covered in rust.
Land Rover Historian Roger Crathorne said: "It's ruined. It's more likely to fetch £2,000 than £200,000."
He said the car's chassis number and paperwork confirmed it was the first diesel to be made - but without its original engine it was not in its complete form.
"It's interesting that it's the first diesel off the production line and it's got its original factory registration. But it's not got its original engine and in the state it's in, the price is way out," he added.
Mr Hughes, managing director of Motiv Trailers in Craven Arms, south Shropshire, said he listed the rickety off-roader at £200,000 to generate interest in its past.
"What is it worth? I don't know. But its value is in its history," he said.
Dave Scott, secretary of Warwickshire and West Midlands Land Rover Club, said: "The seller believes this to be the first production 88inch 2 litre diesel. The chassis number certainly supports this."
But he questioned when the car was registered.
"According to Heynes purchase and restoration manual, the diesel was not introduced until June 1957.
"At this time Land Rover could virtually sell everything it produced so creating a five-month stockpile seems odd," said Mr Scott.
Mr Hughes said he had received inquiries from collectors as far afield as Portugal and Germany.
He said: "For every email I've had from someone interested in it there have been four from people saying 'you're off your rocker, you're never going to get that for it.'
"But I've looked at what other historic vehicles like this have gone for over the past 18 months and left the price open. If it exceeds £200,000 then I would be extremely surprised.
"But if someone came forward who wanted to restore it for a price I thought was fair I would sell it."
The up-for-grabs vehicle's design is the basis for the iconic model which became known as the Defender in the 90s.
The last Defender was made at the Solihull factory on 29 January after Jaguar Land Rover discontinued it.
The car's logbook shows it was registered in 1957 and sold 10 years later to Albert George Dyer in Handsworth, Birmingham.
The same owner moved to Adleymoor, Bucknell, Shropshire, in 1975.
Mr Hughes said the robust off-roader was used on a farm until 1982 but had been out of work ever since. He bought the car as a restoration project but does not have the time to dedicate to it.
"I've had people calling up and telling me bits of information about it which has been really useful.
"I'd love someone to come forward and say 'I know that car, it belonged to my dad, here's a picture of it on the beach."

article Jared Kushner said all of his "actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events" of the campaign.
Mr Kushner, 36, has also denied any collusion with Russia.
He is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the campaign's digital strategy.
He is married to Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
Speaking at the White House after a closed-door session of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr Kushner said he had been "fully transparent in providing all the requested information".
"Let me be very clear - I did not collude with Russia, nor do I know of anyone else in the campaign who did so. I had no improper contacts," he said.
Mr Kushner, who keeps a very low media profile, will appear before the equivalent House of Representatives committee on Tuesday.
In a statement to both congressional committees released before the Senate session on Monday, he said there were "hardly any" contacts with Russian representatives, adding later that there were "perhaps four".
He refers to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year. She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton.
Mr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting, realised little of note was being discussed and that it was "time not well-spent".
Mr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided.
In his statement, Mr Kushner accepted that he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians.
He says the first form, a "rough draft that still had many omissions", was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts, not just with Russians, were added over the next six months "in the normal course".
Mr Trump Jr and Mr Manafort had been scheduled to appear before Congress on Wednesday to testify but that has been delayed indefinitely as lawyers negotiate on the documentation and information to be discussed.
Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter
In his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is "happy" to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
His written statement, however, is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion. He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere, then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal.
He receives hundreds of emails a day and didn't read his brother-in-law's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign.
Reports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals.
He met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he couldn't initially remember - was so persistent.
The incomplete security form was the result of a "miscommunication" with an assistant who submitted it too soon.

article Cumbria County Council wants to build a new wing at Sandgate School on the Queen Katherine School site in Appleby Road in Kendal.
Sandgate School has split locations in the town and the new development will mean year 7 to 9 pupils joining students at the Queen Katherine site.
The county council said it wanted to integrate children further with the "wider community".
A spokesman said, subject to planning permission, building work would begin in 2017 and the new building would open in 2018.
Sandgate is a 72-place school catering for children up to the age of 19 who have a very wide spectrum of needs.
Councillor Clare Feeney-Johnson, the council's member for schools and learning, said: "This development will create purpose-built facilities for the school and enable all of Sandgate's secondary age students to be on a single site.
"Pupils have been involved in the design process and their feedback has helped shape the layout of the new building."

article The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working "at the hardest job in the world".
After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea.
Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll.
Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: "The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform.
"They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers."
Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying "look at my money" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth.
And the men wore open-necked shirts as "however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland," he added
Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when "thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever".
At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was "the largest fishing port in the world".
The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because "everything was in the melting pot".
"Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, " he added.
The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars.
Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own.
The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore.
The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland.
This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull.
Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit.
The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed.
Mr Ludlam said the ports had "always been at daggers drawn" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride.
He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed.
The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered.
Mr Ludlam said: "Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back."
The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby

article Mr Buhari, who was elected in March partly on a promise to tackle corruption and insecurity, vowed to select competent and clean individuals.
But when the much-anticipated list was released, many were disappointed, asking whether the wait had been worth it, and whether those selected were the best in the country.
Some say the list is full of old and recycled politicians who have been part of Nigeria's problems.
The youths who worked tirelessly during his campaign have also been disappointed because the average age in the cabinet is 52. Some women's groups have also voiced their anger that there are just six females on the list.
The 36 names approved by MPs - but yet to be given portfolios - include five former governors, nine lawyers, four former senators, three academics, two medical doctors, two retired soldiers and a clergyman.
The combination of experienced politicians and technocrats shows that the president was trying to balance his choice - rewarding party loyalists, while also selecting some professionals.
His hands were also tied by the constitutional requirement to choose at least one person from each of Nigeria's 36 states.
His supporters say the list shows he is committed to fulfilling his election promises, adding that age and gender do not matter at this stage because the country needs to be rescued urgently.
Here are seven interesting characters to watch in the cabinet:
It is not surprising that Mr Fashola made the list.
His achievements during his tenure as governor of Lagos state - Nigeria's commercial capital - makes him a good asset.
He is credited with bringing an element of order to the chaotic city through massive infrastructure development that included demolishing illegal structures to pave the way for new road projects.
Nigeria in pictures: Lagos facelift
As a senior lawyer and experienced administrator, it won't be surprising if he is asked to head the justice ministry.
The president has promised to root out corruption and bribery allegations that tainted the image of Nigeria's judicial system.
The former ExxonMobil executive vice-chairman was appointed by President Buhari in August to head the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), an organisation vital to Africa's largest economy but notorious for corruption and mismanagement.
Many analysts believe his appointment has started to yield results.
It is surprising that he has now been asked to join the cabinet and is very likely to be appointed a minister in the oil ministry.
This means a new NNPC head may have to be appointed.
Even though the president has said he will oversee the ministry himself, most of the work and reforms he plans to carry out will be handled by Mr Kachikwu.
It will be interesting to see how he will help Mr Buhari clean up the oil sector and recover the mind-boggling sums he said had been stolen.
Does Nigeria run better without a cabinet?
Buhari's to-do list
Is Buhari a changed man?
She is a well-known technocrat within and outside Nigeria. She has more than 30 years of experience in the field of development, including as Nigeria's presidential adviser on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
She was credited with designing and developing several government projects aimed at reducing poverty.
Before joining the cabinet, Ms Mohammed was the Special Adviser to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon on post-2015 development planning.
Her eloquence and globally-exposed experience in development and management could be an asset to the government if correctly exploited.
He is the most controversial of all the appointees even though his inclusion did not come as surprise.
As President Buhari's campaign director, many Nigerians see Mr Amaechi's appointment as pay-back for the role he played in the president's victory during the election.
However, his choice has been heavily criticised after he was indicted by Rivers state's panel of inquiry for allegedly enriching himself during his eight-year tenure as the state's governor.
He denied all the allegations and said they were politically motivated. He also took the commission to court.
Opposition MPs tried to block his appointment but the ruling party used its majority to get him through.
As Nigeria's Chief of Army Staff between 2008 and 2010, he led a successful campaign against militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
After he was sacked, the militants regrouped in 2011. Since then, thousands of people have been killed and the insurgency has spread to neighbouring countries.
Tackling the group is one of Mr Buhari's top priorities, so it will be interesting to see how Mr Dambazzau will tackle the conflict now, assuming he is asked to head the ministry of defence as expected.
She is an economist and financial expert who was educated and worked in the UK before going back to Nigeria to serve as a commissioner of finance in the south-western state of Ogun.
Many expect her to be posted to the finance ministry.
During her presentation to the Senate, she said funds allocated for various projects are being diverted and identified ways to stop this happening.
She also said the country cannot afford to continue spending 78% of its budget on paying civil servants' salaries and other ongoing costs.
It will be interesting to see how the financial markets, investors and ordinary Nigerians will react to her appointment and whether she will be able to transform the country's struggling economy.
As a veteran politician with four decades of experience, Mr Ogbe, 68, is known to be independent-minded and self-willed and has served in several previous governments.
Many remember him for his public row with ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005, when he was chairman of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party.
He was forced to resign from the position after accusing Mr Obasanjo of interfering in party affairs.
Mr Ogbe is an experienced farmer who is expected to be appointed to lead the vital agriculture ministry.
Nigeria has a vast tracts of land that analysts say, if used properly, could create jobs for the country's army of unemployed youths and reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil.
Nigerians will be hoping that he is able to bring this theory to reality.

article Written off by his rivals and the media after suffering a drubbing at the hands of Narendra Modi's resurgent BJP in last May's general elections, India's most famous anti-corruption campaigner has bounced back.
The former tax inspector took on a ruling party at the peak of its power and felled it in the national capital. For sheer symbolism, Mr Kejriwal's victory in Delhi is astounding, the proverbial David slaying the all-mighty Goliath. The scale of the BJP's defeat makes Mr Kejriwal's win truly extraordinary.
How did India's most powerful and richest party - with its charismatic leader, fabled organisational skills and political nous - get it so wrong?
A little over a year ago, the BJP picked up 32 of 70 seats in hung elections to the Delhi state assembly. Last May, it took all seven of the capital's parliamentary seats, as well as bordering the capital. It rolled out the heavy artillery against Mr Kejriwal in Delhi - Mr Modi himself led the campaign, helped by nearly two dozen federal ministers and 120 MPs. But to no avail. "This is not just a defeat for the BJP, this is a decimation in a high-profile election," says Swapan Dasgupta, a columnist who is no admirer of Mr Kejriwal.
For one, Mr Kejriwal launched his campaign to regain Delhi as early as last July. Most believe the anti-corruption campaigner's masterstroke was telling people that he was sorry for quitting in haste after a chaotic 49-day stint in power following an impressive debut in the December 2013 state polls. He went to every neighbourhood and slum to beg forgiveness. "We have made a mistake", he told people, "but we haven't sinned." In a country where politicians are increasingly seen as aloof and arrogant, Mr Kejriwal's atonement worked wonders. Every comeback needs true believers, and Delhi's voters believed him.
Mr Kejriwal also drove a positive - and populist - campaign focusing on Delhi. The BJP surprised many by running a personal campaign against Mr Kejriwal. It was, most said, bound to backfire.
The fact that Mr Kejriwal's party won more than half of the popular vote - the highest by any party in Delhi ever - also points to the fact that his supporters transcended class and religion:  the poor and the minorities appear to have backed him, and a large section of the middle class, which had deserted him, returned. One young professional, who voted for the BJP in May, told me he was voting for Mr Kejriwal this time because he was unnerved by Mr Modi's failure to gag his party's radical fringe.
But more importantly, say analysts like Neerja Chowdhury, "voters in Delhi also reacted to the BJP's arrogance of power". The BJP is a cadre-based party with deep roots in Delhi. Analysts say voters did not take kindly to former policewoman Kiran Bedi being introduced at the last-minute as the BJP's chief ministerial candidate.  Also, Mr Kejriwal represents what many say is a refreshing brand of unostentatious politics, far removed from the flashy political culture associated with both the BJP and Congress. "Hope has returned," said AAP leader Yogendra Yadav.
It won't be easy. Mr Kejriwal faces considerable challenges in governing one of the world's megacities. Although petty corruption was kept in check, his shambolic 49-day government did not inspire much confidence. Delhi is a complex city-state where 40% of the people are migrants and faces serious problems with water, electricity, housing, air pollution and choking traffic. Can Mr Kejriwal shed his activist mode and make the kind of compromises that come with governance? Analyst Ashish Nandy says the AAP's win is a "return to politics of populism". But just how much populism can Delhi - and India - afford?
For Mr Modi and the BJP, defeat marks the end of the honeymoon period and they are stripped of their aura of invincibility.
Now, fractious - and largely discredited - opposition parties across the country will be emboldened and begin believing they can take on the BJP. That will be easier said than done. Congress, which has drawn a complete blank for the first time in Delhi, appears to be facing an existential crisis. "This is a big morale booster for India's opposition parties," says Neerja Chowdhury. But it will take a lot more effort to translate that spirit into votes against the BJP across the country.

article But Labour and backbench Tory MPs accused ministers of breaking a promise for a vote on the warrant itself.
The debate ended early when Labour lost its attempt to use a rare Parliamentary procedure to postpone the decision.
Earlier, Commons Speaker John Bercow said people would be "contemptuous" of the government's tactics.
BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said there were "scenes of chaos" in the Commons chamber.
The government opted out of all 133 EU police and criminal justice measures measures in 2013, a decision that will take effect on 1 December.
However, ministers plan to rejoin 35 of the measures, including the European Arrest Warrant, before that deadline.
Supporters, including the government and law enforcement agencies, say the warrant is a vital tool to protect the UK and bring criminals to justice across EU borders.
However, critics - including some Conservative MPs - say the European Arrest Warrant is overused and a threat to the liberties of Britons and the sovereignty of the UK.
Commons clashes erupted after Mr Bercow ruled the debate and vote would not cover the arrest warrant.
Mrs May said only 11 of the EU justice measures needed to be voted on and "transposed" into UK law. But she told MPs the Commons' verdict on these measures would be treated as a vote on the whole package of 35.
The debate came to an end when shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper invoked a rare procedure to ask that the "question be not now put", asking Mrs May to come back with a motion which specifically included the warrant.
Faced with a potential backbench rebellion, Prime Minister David Cameron returned early from the Lord Mayor's Banquet dressed in a white tie, while other Tories were urgently called back to Parliament to take part in the vote.
When Mrs Cooper's motion was defeated by 272 to 229 - a majority of just 43 - the vote on the EU justice measures took place immediately, with MPs voting in favour by 464 to 38.
The government's approach was criticised by Mr Bercow and Conservative MPs.
"There is not today to be a vote on the specific matter of membership of the European Arrest Warrant," Mr Bercow told MPs.
The Speaker said he himself had expected a vote on the warrant, saying it was a "sorry saga" and that "the House should not be put in that position".
"A commitment is a commitment to be honoured," he said, "rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice".
He said the public expected "straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous, and I use the word advisedly, of what is not straightforward dealing".
Q&A: European Arrest Warrant
Conservative MP Sir Richard Shepherd said the government's behaviour had been "sly", while fellow Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg called it "underhand".
Tory MP Bill Cash, who chairs the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, said: "This is a disgraceful way of going about a very, very important matter. It is tainted with chicanery, it is not the way this Parliament should be treated."
Despite the speaker's ruling, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons the vote would be on all 35 of the EU crime and justice measures.
And Mrs May said the government was not legally required to bring the measures to the House. Transposing some into UK law would usually be done through a special committee of MPs, she said.
When the main debate got under way, Mrs May said she understood concerns over the warrant but said she had legislated to make it "better and safer".
Setting out the case to retain it, she told MPs more than 95% of people extradited from the UK were foreign nationals, including suspects wanted for 124 murders, more than 100 rapes, nearly 500 serious assaults and seven terrorism cases.
The home secretary said "harmful individuals" could walk free and escape justice without the "vital" regulations, saying the process had to be completed by 1 December to avoid an "operational gap".
But Mrs Cooper, who said she supported the European Arrest Warrant, nonetheless said Mrs May had presided over a Parliamentary "shambles".
"You have effectively said ministers are just going to make it up because the Speaker has been very clear that this does not include a vote on the European Arrest Warrant, you are just going to reinterpret it in any way you choose," she said.

article Consider the roadblocks. Bobby Lennox - so shy as a kid he was embarrassed to play football in other people's company.
John Clark - his young life ruined by the death of his father in a railway accident.
Stevie Chalmers - so sick from tuberculosis-meningitis in his late teens and early 20s that he was given three weeks to live.
Jock Stein - left his job as Celtic reserve team manager on account of his religion, the Parkhead board telling him that as a Protestant he had gone as far as he could possibly go at the club.
Stein was in tears that day. So say a number of his former players in a documentary - Glasgow 1967 - about the Lions and the city they came from, to be aired on Wednesday on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 BST.

It's part football film, part social history, part dream come true, a Cinderella tale to match any Cinderella tale the global game has ever produced. So much has been said and written about them. A quick online search shows that at least 32 books, two plays and a novel have been penned in their honour.
In this past week, the newspapers have been full of supplements, fine journalism that came at the story from new angles. There are other documentaries available, there are CDs, there's a Lisbon Lions cushion, if you fancy it, there's a Lions tea towel, a Lions iPad cover, a Lions mouse mat.
On Sunday at Celtic Park, 60,000 people created a stunning visual display that evoked their legend. On Thursday, thousands more will gather at the SSE Hydro to do it all again, this time in the company of Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Alex Ferguson, Martin O'Neill, Gordon Strachan and others.
The story never gets old, the appetite never sated.
There's a simple and lovely moment close to the beginning of Glasgow 1967 when Willie Wallace, now living in Australia, revisits Celtic Park and wanders about its corridors. "Fifty years and they're still going on about it," he says with a smile on his face that spoke of pride, no doubt, but also amusement at all the fuss.
These lads didn't do fuss. They didn't consider themselves celebrities, just footballers, guys who adored the game and who were blessed with a talent and a hunger to succeed.
On that May day, Jimmy Johnstone, hot to trot, stared over at the bronzed athletes of Inter Milan as they took to the field in Lisbon and said to Bertie Auld: "Look at them, wee man, they're like film stars!"
And Auld's answer cut to the heart of the greatness that was about to show itself. "Aye, but can they PLAY?"
The Lions could play on a carpet and they could play on a ploughed field just as fluently. There's footage of them training on muck, not grass. That was the way of it. That was the norm. There's more footage of what tough economic times they lived in and yet amid the gloom this thing of beauty emerged.

The documentary is called Glasgow 1967 for a reason, for what shines through is the character not just of the players and their manager, but of their supporters and their city.
Humour courses through the narrative of Lisbon like a fast-running river. The emotion and the hilarity of the supporters elevates what happened to almost mythical proportions.
The fans are here in numbers. Ian Martin making a cup of tea in his kitchen and telling of the day he left for Lisbon in a Mini Cooper as part of a three-car cavalcade. "One of the boys in the other motor lost his suitcase even before he got to Bishopbriggs. It fell off the roof-rack."
There's Jimmy Quinn telling of an uncomfortable conversation with his fiancee. "I said, 'See this getting married carry-on, saving up for an engagement ring an' that, I want to go to the cup final. End of story'. She wasn't a bit pleased."
John Cowan was on a flight out of Glasgow that touched down uncomfortably close to kick-off-time. The doors of the plane swung open. The airline had no steps in place and the 19-year-old John didn't have the luxury of waiting - so he jumped.
"I sat down on the ledge and went for it," he recalls. "There was guys coming behind me. Dropping, dropping, dropping. And we started running towards the terminal."

God knows where Charlie Fryars and his mates were at this point, but Fryars' personal odyssey is a glorious illustration of the fact that, in many ways, there were more than 11 Lions in Lisbon.
Charlie tells part of his tale in the documentary, the full comic brilliance of it being told in a piece he has written for the ByTheMinute Celtic platform online. It begins when his mate, Gerry Loney, rings him up and offers him a seat in his Austin Cambridge, bound for Lisbon.
Charlie and Gerry plus Laurence Donnelly, John Hughes and Jim McDaid met at the Admiral Bar in Waterloo Street in Glasgow and hit the road. They had almost 2,000 miles to drive and three days to do it. That meant no hotel stops and as few comfort breaks as possible. Their first destination was Southampton to catch the boat to Cherbourg. They got as far as Lockerbie when the car broke down.
The explorers made the ferry, got some sleep on the four-hour crossing, drove down the Cotentin Peninsula and into Nantes where they had some beers in a bar near the station - and another kip. Not Charlie, though. Charlie was busy falling in love with a 19-year-old waitress called Ghislaine.
After half an hour, Ghislaine threw her arms around him and gave him a kiss. "She wanted my Celtic scarf and I said to her, 'No, we need it for hanging out the window." What greater love can one man have for his football club than to refuse to lay down his scarf for the gorgeous Ghislaine?
On they went - a thousand miles to go and only 33 hours left. Their exhaust pipe went near La Rochelle, but they got help and found a new one. They had a moment of weakness near San Sebastian, but they pulled back from the brink and carried on.
They came to the Portuguese border and it was closed for the night. The guards saw their colours and waved them through.
They made the kick-off, celebrated thunderously and then turned around and drove home. They were seven days on the road there and back, a whole week sleeping in the Austin Cambridge; unwashed, weary, but with memories that will sustain them for the rest of their lives. They didn't play that day in Lisbon, but what is that if not footballing heroism?
"When I got home," says Charlie, "I got my Celtic scarf and I parcelled it up and I wrote a letter to Ghislaine at Bar de la Garde, Nantes... I never heard from her." On that 4,000 mile trek, two happy endings was too much to hope for.
One was enough, more than enough. In this film, you marvel anew not just at what the Lions achieved, not just the lengths that 10,000 Celtic people went to in order to see them achieve it, but how powerful that achievement remains to this day, the magnitude of it passed on from father to son through the generations.
Glasgow 1967: The Lisbon Lions will be shown on BBC One Scotland at 21:00 on Wednesday 24 May. It can be seen in other parts of the United Kingdom at 23:20.

article The Number Four Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Henan province was partially demolished on Thursday amid a land dispute, Xinhua news agency said.
Hospital staff told reporters equipment worth over $600,000 was damaged.
The case has sparked outrage in China, where forced demolitions are common.
Doctors told local media that several men in camouflage uniforms showed up at the hospital, in Huiji district, on Thursday, and began bulldozing the building.
Liu Chunguang, director of the hospital's radiology department, told Xinhua news agency he was examining a patient when the demolition took place.
"A gaping hole appeared - the patient was half-scared to death, and ran out."
Meanwhile, hospital official Yuan Fang told Xinhua that radiology equipment had been damaged and the hospital had had to suspend its activities, forcing many patients to switch hospitals.
"Burying the bodies of patients in rubble is extremely disrespectful to the deceased," he added.
The local Huiji district government said in a statement that the hospital's CT room and morgue were on land designated for a road expansion project, and that it had asked the hospital to dismantle the rooms themselves several times.
The hospital was evacuated prior to demolition, and there were no casualties, the statement added.
However, hospital officials said three doctors and a patient were in the building at the time of demolition, and that some hospital workers were injured when they tried to stop the demolition, Jinghua news reported.

article In Scotland, 351.4mm of rainfall was recorded with Cluanie Inn, Ross and Cromarty, the wettest place (768.4mm)
It was also an unusually warm month, with temperatures about 2.7C above the long term average.
Provisional figures also reveal 2015 was the second wettest year on record in Scotland. Only 2011 was wetter.
Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: "It fits in with most people's perceptions that in the latter part of the year it was particularly wet.
"There were a a lot of fronts approaching the UK from the Azores and the Tropics. Warmer air brings moisture and that translates into more rainfall."
The average temperature (including both day and night) was 5.4C, making it the fifth warmest on record. The long term average (1910-1981) for Scotland in December is 2.8C.
Annual rainfall for 2015 was 1869.2mm, only beaten by the 1886.4mm recorded in 2011.
By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst
The Met Office says there is a direct link between the warmth and the record rains that brought widespread floods across Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England.
Storms propelled by the jet stream were mainly to blame, it says, with contributions from the El Nino weather phenomenon and man-made climate change.
December was something of a freak month, it acknowledges. Climate change has raised UK temperatures by around 1C (1.8F) so far, so it will be many decades before this level of extreme weather becomes the new winter norm, it says.
Other scientists say that with climate change, there will be no "normal" weather.

Scotland was one of the few countries in the UK to experience regular frosts. The UK as a whole saw just 2.6 days of air frost which is eight days below the long term average.
Mr Madge said it was too early to deduce long term trends but he added: "When you look at the wettest years, five out of six for the UK as a whole have been since 2000."

article Praveen Sood told the BBC that police officers had reviewed footage from almost 70 CCTV cameras.
But he said police were looking into isolated incidents in other parts of the city that night.
A number of women have told the media they were assaulted by groups of men.
Some have described being surrounded by unruly mobs, and being groped and harassed.
Praveen Sood said police had responded to footage from a member of the public who said a woman had been attacked by two men on a motorbike near his home.
"We had a look at it. We saw it was quite a clear case of serious molestation. We didn't wait, we didn't even bother with whom the victim is. We didn't ask her, we wanted to protect her identity. We have registered a criminal case," he said.
But, Mr Sood said, the alleged attacks in the centre of Bangalore never took place. The incidents are said to have occurred in the MG road area as a crowd of 10,000 people gathered there to see in the New Year on Saturday.
He said the footage being used by the media to make allegations of mass molestation was actually that of the melee that had resulted from a baton charge by police who were trying to disperse the crowds.
"People ran, there were a lot of girls there. There was panic, there was a melee, they got separated, they were cryingâ€¦ so that 30 seconds of confusion is being projected as a mass molestation. I categorically say that nothing of that sort has happened," he said.
Six people held on Wednesday were detained over an incident in a different part of the city, he said.
Mr Sood said that despite a public appeal, no one had come forward to record a complaint of molestation or harassment.
He said, however, that he had seen some women telling the media that they were touched inappropriately and that the police were ready to treat those statements as complaints and begin an investigation.
One woman, a marketing professional who asked to be identified only as Pooja, told the BBC that she was assaulted both in a bar and as she walked to meet a friend.
Even when she formed a circle with another group of girls to try and walk to safety, "there were guys who were trying to touch here and there", she said.
"There was not a single face you could make out or who was doing it," she said, pointing out how difficult it would be to file a complaint.
Another woman, photographer Chaitali Wasnik, told the BBC she was groped in another part of Bangalore on New Year's Eve.
She said a man approached her and tried to grab her breasts, but ran away when she fought back.
"I want the girls to know that you can come forward and speak it out, whatever you have faced," she told the BBC. "You don't have to be scared."

article The Brazilian town of Tabatinga vies for size and importance with Colombia's Leticia. While on the Peruvian side - across the mighty Amazon River - is the tiny hamlet of Santa Rosa. Together they form a unique 'triple town' known as Tres Fronteiras.
Though far from the glamour cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - the engines of Brazil's economic miracle - Tabatinga is experiencing a period of extraordinary growth. This is a city with three universities, a deep-water port, and an international airport - all built within the last five years to serve a population that has doubled in size since 2000.

Tabatinga is now more than a match for its neighbour Leticia, though the capital of Colombia's Amazonas state has also changed beyond recognition in recent years.
Three decades ago, this was a key staging post in Pablo Escobar's narco-trafficking network. The man who engineered this network for Escobar - Evaristo Porras - built his personal mansion here, painstakingly reproducing the Carrington Family home from the TV series Dynasty.
The mansion is now a ruin, though others have been turned into boutique hotels. Tourism is booming in Leticia, and helping to fill the void left by the collapse of the cartels with honest dollars.
The Peruvian side of the trio is very much the junior partner. With a population of only around 600, Santa Rosa is not much more than a single street. There's a handful of cevicherias, or fish restaurants, where tourists staying in Tabatinga or Leticia come to sample Peru's famous cuisine.
But no running water, electricity or other basic services. This may soon change as the Brazilian economic miracle sucks in more and more cheap imports from Peru.
Among these imports is illegal timber. Deforestation rates on the Brazilian side of the border have fallen dramatically in recent years, according to government figures. But rates in Peru have increased - leading some to accuse Brazil of merely outsourcing the problem to its neighbours.
Meanwhile the cocaine trade hasn't gone away, and there are rumours of a new strain of the drug - allegedly genetically modified - that's able to grow in lowland areas like the Amazon basin as well as in its native highland environment.
Together with illegal distilleries, drug smuggling and deforestation threaten the survival of indigenous communities living in the forest surrounding our square mile. With hardwoods fetching up to $3,000 (Â£1,850)  (per tree, and a kilo of cocaine worth about the same, the temptations are immense.
To protect themselves and their forest, the Huitoto people have taken policing into their own hands with the formation of the Indigenous Guard. Armed with sticks, they patrol the forest and report any wrongdoing to the police.
But the nature of the territory does not make things easy for them - with its thousands of small rivers and streams, our square mile is a smuggler's paradise, and Tabatinga is still thought to be the main point of entry of cocaine into Brazil. Behind the development success story, the old sources of wealth are still going strong.

article Initial reports spoke of two bombs but it gradually became clear that there was a single blast, possibly in the third carriage of the train.
Dozens of people were wounded, and seven people died in the immediate aftermath. Another victim died on the way to hospital and two more fatalities were confirmed later in hospital. The wounded were taken to four city hospitals.
Although the explosion happened in between the two stations the driver continued to Tekhnologichesky Institut to enable victims to be helped more easily. Russia's investigative committee said this decision may have helped prevent further losses.
Early indications were that the bomb was an improvised device made out of the explosive TNT and was possibly hidden in a briefcase close to the carriage doors. Pictures from the scene showed mangled doors and bodies on the floor of the platform.
Minutes later another device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. That was safely defused and reports said it contained 1kg of TNT, more than used in the original blast.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the blast as a "terrorist act" and Russia's investigative committee said it was opening a criminal inquiry under article 205 of the criminal code which refers specifically to terrorist acts. The committee said that all other possibilities were being investigated too.
No organisation has said it carried out the attack but a local website Fontanka.ru and Ren TV published a photo captured by CCTV cameras of a bearded man wearing a black hat and coat. It is not known if he survived the blast.
At the time of the explosion President Vladimir Putin was just outside Russia's second city, meeting Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at the Konstantin palace in Strelna.
The St Petersburg metro was shut down and three days of mourning declared. Traffic in surrounding streets and in much of central St Petersburg was brought to a standstill for hours, and volunteers offered lifts via social media to people trying to get home.
Moscow authorities said they were taking additional security measures on the Russian capital's metro, and at stations, airports and other public places.
Russia's transport infrastructure has been targeted before.

article The country's first president of indigenous origin faces a tough challenge after 10 years in power.
He called a referendum to ratify constitutional amendments approved by parliament last year.
Mr Morales says he needs a third term for social reforms but the opposition says the change is undemocratic.
"On Sunday we will win big," Mor Morales said during the campaign. "The people will decide and there will be a lot to celebrate."
Mr Morales, an indigenous Aymara and former coca leaf producer, took office in January 2006.
His second term ends in 2020 but he will be able to run for another term in 2019 and serve until 2025 if the referendum is approved.
Mr Morales has already been elected three times but argues that the first term does not count because a new constitution was approved in 2009, re-founding the country as Plurinational State of Bolivia.
Despite a drop in the international price of oil and natural gas, the Bolivian economy has performed well in the past 10 years, growing on average 5% a year.
The government's socialist policies have also been successful in reducing extreme poverty.
But recent allegations that Mr Morales used his influence to favour a Chinese construction firm in Bolivia have damaged his approval ratings.
A former girlfriend of Mr Morales, Gabriela Zapata, holds an important position in the company, CAMC, which has secured more than $500m (Â£350m) in contracts with the Bolivian government
Mr Morales rejected the allegations and said he had nothing to hide. He ordered an investigation into how the contracts were awarded.

article The Android store will abandon the low/medium/high maturity classifications it has used until now and switch to a system run by an outside body.
As increasing numbers of youngsters are left alone to play with smartphones and tablets, the move will allow Google to show it takes its responsibilities seriously.
But there remains the potential for confusion - and controversy.
Google says it wants to reassure parents that apps are properly labelled by bringing in the experts rather than relying on developers to self-certify their products, as had been the case until now.
Rather than use its own proprietary classifications, it will offer parents and children labels similar to those already used to provide guidance about the suitability of boxed video games for different age groups, which should be relatively familiar.
A relatively new body called the International Age Rating Coalition.
It was founded two years ago, but its members have been in the age classification business for decades.
Instead of a centralised office issuing a single global age rating for each app, Iarc's five participants each give their own grades, taking into account local laws and different cultural sensitivities.
So, apps that contain nudity, violence, references to gambling and drugs and other potentially unsuitable material, will be ranked differently depending on where in the world a user's account is based.
The bodies involved are:
Generic ratings are assigned to territories without a participating authority.
If, for whatever reason, one or more of the rating authorities refuse to classify an app, it will not be distributed in the relevant countries.
Iarc says not.
Developers only have to fill in a single questionnaire about how their apps function and the content they contain.
The different bodies then share the information.
Makers of apps that don't contain content of their own - including calendars, calculators and other utilities - should be able to complete the process in less than a minute, the coalition's chairwoman Patricia Vance told the BBC. Even those involving more work shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes.
The system is automated, so the ratings should be spat out shortly after the answers are punched in.
However, Iarc promises there will be manual checks of the most popular apps and any which receive complaints from customers.
"The volume of apps in a storefront like Google Play is just enormous," explained Pegi's Dirk Bosmans.
"We can't follow the same [hands-on] approach that we do for boxed games, but we don't have to make the process as robust as there's no physical product here.
"If a physical product is mis-rated that's a logistical nightmare as you have to pull the boxes back from the shops and reprint them.
"With apps you can just say, 'That age seven rating should have been a 12,' and with a snap of the finger, reprogramme it."
Actually, Google Play isn't the first to throw its lot in with Iarc.
Mozilla's lesser-used Firefox Marketplace already depends on its rankings.
And the body says Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are also set to join.
Iarc would love to take over the iOS store's age ratings and says it has discussed the possibility with the iPhone-maker.
But for now, Apple has opted to retain its own system.
That could potentially be confusing for families using a mix of devices.
For example, Apple's guidelines state that an app depicting mild occurrences of cartoon-like violence should get a nine+ rating, but the ESRB allows the same type of product to be classed E, meaning suitable for everyone.
Likewise, Apple says apps including nudity should be limited to a 17+ audience, while Pegi says nudity is fine for the 3+ crowd if it's non-sexual and 16+ if erotic.
Apple declined to comment about its future plans.
Not quite.
The ratings are limited to an app's content and don't involve privacy issues.
So, Iarc's members would judge a storybook app, for instance, to be suitable for a pre-teen age group based solely on the innocuous plot it tells.
But it could still be problematic if it required the user to share data about their location, contacts, photos or other device use.
This is a real concern. Earlier this month, 29 privacy watchdogs across the globe announced they were investigating what information was being collected by some of the leading apps targeted at children because of fears that too much personal information was being recorded.
Apps containing user generated content that isn't moderated before publication pose a separate challenge.
The ESRB plans to give such products a "teen" rating, while Pegi will instead show an exclamation mark icon, indicating that further parental guidance is necessary.
Yes. But there are proposals to change this.
Some campaigners are pressing for an age-verification scheme that would let app stores confirm that young device-owners were old enough to download a product without needing to hold personal information about them on file.
This would involve a trusted third party carrying out the necessary ID checks and then vouching for the child's age at the point of purchase, explains Dr Rachel O'Connell, chief executive of the tech advisory service Trust Elevate.
If the child was flagged as being below Iarc's relevant age rating, she said, an email could be automatically sent to their parents asking for their permission.
While it might take years to get such an initiative up and running, the GSMA - which represents mobile operators - says other steps could be taken in the meantime.
It suggests age-restricted apps could pose children a series of challenging questions to try to catch out those attempting to pretend to be older than they are - such as requiring them to type in their date of birth - and only giving them one chance to get the answer right.
There are also existing parental control apps and settings in Android Lollipop that can be used to prevent unauthorised access to the marketplace and only allow children access to specific titles.

article The country is already a pioneer in the use of mobile money.
The government is looking to tap into that network by allowing mobile phone users to trade the government securities across their phones.
Kenyans can buy one of the bonds for as little as 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30; Â£23), the country's central bank said.
Kenya's banking system is fuelled by mobile payments.
The main provider of mobile transactions, M-Pesa - which is Swahili for money - has about 20 million users, and there are more than 100 times as many M-Pesa kiosks as there are cash machines in Kenya.
Finance Minister Henry Rotich said the government was initially making a limited offer of 150 million shillings to test the new bond before a bigger offer in June.
Kenya has borrowed heavily in the past four years to fund an ambitious construction programme, including roads and a new railway.
The bond, called M-Akiba, can be bought by phone users without any need for a bank account and pays an estimated interest of 10%.
Aly Khan Satchu, a financial analyst in Nairobi, told the BBC: "It's giving access to every Kenyan citizen to government securities.
"The idea of collecting nickel and dimes and aggregating them will be a source of potentially cheap money for the government.
"But I think ultimately it's a story about enfranchisement - allowing people with as little as $30 to invest in the capital markets. That's a good thing."
The country's central bank governor, Patrick Njoroge, said the bond would "dramatically improve the savings culture of our people".
Ronak Gadhia, an analyst at Exotix Partners, said he believed it was the first country to issue such bonds.
"And that is because no other country in the world has adopted mobile banking as much as Kenya has."
Kenya's mobile-traded government bond has been in the works since 2015, and was finally launched today.
For as little as $30, Kenyan mobile users can now lend to the government and get paid a tax-free interest of 10% every six months.
Even though the minimum requirement is very low, government bonds have always been the preserve of the well-to-do, and a high level of awareness will be required for less investment-savvy individuals to take this up.
The success of this bond would shake up financial services by giving small investors alternatives to low interest earning accounts in banks, mobile money wallets, and savings co-operatives.
Apart from encouraging people to save, the platform will provide the Kenyan government with a new source of cheap money that it intends to use to finance large infrastructure projects.
Currently, only 2% of government bonds in Kenya are bought and sold by individual investors.

article Last week, UKIP's ruling body excluded one of the better known candidates to succeed Nigel Farage because his application missed by the deadline by 17 minutes.
Three members of the executive promptly resigned, one of them telling the BBC the party was in a fight for its very survival.
"There is a huge amount of confusion, flux and sadly infighting," Steven Woolfe, the excluded candidate, told me, as he pinned the blame on the executive.
Over at the Labour Party, the mood is, if anything, more poisonous.
After its National Executive imposed a retrospective cut-off date for party members to be eligible to vote in next month's election, it was challenged in court and lost.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of each case, from the outside it does not look great for those who ask us for our votes on polling day to appear to be narrowing the choice in their own internal elections.
There are plenty of reasons to wonder whether the political parties are increasingly out-of-step with the voters.
The European referendum is only the latest example.
There is much to be said for maintaining your principles even when they are not popular.
So, the Liberal Democrats say they will campaign at the next general election for the UK to be in the EU.
Two peers are reported to have resigned the party whip in protest, perhaps aware that it might not increase the chances of a Lib Dem revival to set its face against the - albeit narrow - decision of a majority of those who voted.
Last year's general election result has not filled any of the parties with confidence, with perhaps the exception of the SNP.
Labour's recovery from one of its worst ever results - in 2010 - consisted of increasing its share of the vote by 1.5%, and losing seats in the process.
The Liberal Democrat share collapsed from 23% to just under 8%.
Its 57 MPs were reduced to eight.
Those two parties, as well as the Conservatives, were all but eliminated from Westminster's Scottish constituencies.
Even UKIP, which took close to four million votes, finishing third overall, ended up with only one MP.
Divided oppositions do not win elections, but they help to hand power to those that do.
David Cameron has bequeathed to his successor, Theresa May, a majority Conservative government, even though the Tories won just shy of 37% of the vote.
"The Tory party is not as strong as the opinion polls might imply," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Foreign Secretary, said.
But he believes the threat to the party's unity posed by Europe has passed.
Although there are divisions even among supporters of Brexit over what deal the UK should negotiate as it leaves the EU, he doubts they will lead to any kind of split, not least because of the cohesive effect on parties of being in power.
"Why is the Tory Party the world's oldest political party?" he asked rhetorically.
"It has been around for 300 years.
"Of course there have been divisions, but the Tory party basically does not have an ideology.
"It has never had an ideology.
"It occasionally has an existential problem, and it does not have one now."
Jenny Willott, one of those Lib Dem MPs ousted in 2015, thinks both her party and UKIP have one advantage compared with the others, a clear and consistent position on the EU.
She thinks the Conservatives and Labour could be hit by divisions over the Brexit negotiations, and at the next general election that could become a cause more important than party.
"We may see people not just standing on the old ticket, so that we have a Labour candidate, a Lib Dem, Tory, UKIP, whatever; I think we might actually see people defining themselves much more clearly as to where they stand on Europe," she said.
The European Union was one of those issues of consensus in the mainstream of British politics; even sceptics such as Sir Malcolm or Jeremy Corbyn still believed the UK should remain in.
Another was light-touch financial regulation, the failure of which exacerbated the effects of the financial crisis.
Faith in the judgement of political elites follows the decline in the "broad church" appeal of political parties.
If there ever was a correlation between income, class and voting, it looks pretty threadbare now.
It is this combination of factors which has made Frank Field, a Labour MP since 1979, sceptical about his party's chances.
Never known for his respect for consensus in politics, Mr Field believes UKIP is "threatening to kill the Labour Party".
Assuming it can overcome its leadership problems, he fears UKIP could do to Labour south of the Scottish border what the SNP has done north of the border.
"If they reshape themselves as the English Party, then there is a real danger that the million voters who previously voted for us in the last election who moved over to UKIP," he said, could be followed by others, "making it impossible for us to be a serious party of opposition challenging for government."
Mr Field said it was not a case of UKIP "stealing" Labour's vote; this passionate EU-sceptic believes there is not what people used to term a "core vote" to steal.
"There clearly is a very, very large section of the Labour vote that does not actually feel natural affinity with Labour any more," he said.
"They are more concerned about the sense of place, of identity, of country."
As Labour MPs agonise about whether or not to split from the parliamentary party in the event of Jeremy Corbyn winning the leadership election, Frank Field fears they may be missing the point.
"We can have this top-down approach that we had with the Gang of Four, the founding of the SDP," he told me.
"We might well do that, but I do not think anybody's listening.
"The key thing that is happening is that voters are moving."
In what direction and who will be there to meet them when they arrive is a question no party politician can answer; no wonder they are so nervous.
As a leading figure in the French Revolution is said to have remarked: "I am their leader and must follow them."

article The countries joined the EU in 2007 but many member states put limits on their citizens working which end this year.
This has raised concerns in the UK that many will now come to seek jobs.
But BBC surveys in each country, both of more than 1,000 people, suggest most would move only with a firm work offer.
Of those questioned more people intended to seek work in the EU including the UK in 2013 than in 2014.
By Sanchia BergBBC Newsnight
There is a significant gap between aspiration and making real concrete plans.
We found that in Romania very small numbers of people, 1% of the total survey sample, said they were looking for work in the UK in 2013 or 2014, whether with a recruitment agency or on their own.
In Bulgaria the figures were higher: 4.2% of those surveyed. However most people interested in coming to the UK, from both countries, said they would only move with a firm offer of work, either from an agency or directly from a company.
For now, more people are planning to move this year, rather than next, but as 2014 approaches, intentions may change.
That is one reason why it is hard to predict precise numbers from the research - the other is that the sample sizes, especially for concrete preparations, are very small.
The survey was complex. It had a long series of questions, ending up with concrete preparations, to try to filter out aspiration, and only capture those who are making real plans.
Read Sanchia's full analysis
A significant number said they would like to work in the UK, but the number making concrete plans was much smaller.
Romania and Bulgaria are among the poorest countries in Europe and when they joined the European Union in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration.
These measures will be dropped on 1 January 2014 giving Bulgarians and Romanians the same rights to work across the union as other EU citizens.
Some in the UK have voiced fears that ending restrictions will trigger a huge influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants seeking work as happened when in 2004 the UK allowed people from European Union accession states including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to work freely.
BBC Newsnight wanted to find out what impact these changes were likely to have, particularly on the numbers intending to come to Britain.
In February 2013 the programme commissioned a test poll, asking independent survey company Vitosha to question 1,000 people across Bulgaria.
People were asked if they intended to come to the UK to work. Over a quarter answered yes.
Analysts say the relatively high figure is unsurprising - times are tough in Bulgaria and many Bulgarians dream of a better life. In some surveys as many as 50% of Bulgarians have said they would like to work abroad, but over the past decade only about 6% have actually left.

BBC Newsnight then asked Vitosha in Bulgaria and Gallup Romania to design a questionnaire which would distinguish between aspiration and real concrete plans.
In March 2013 each of the agencies interviewed face to face more than 1,000 people representative of the country as a whole, in villages, in cities, in all regions of Romania and Bulgaria.

People were asked a range of questions about their current situation and whether they had any intentions to move elsewhere in the EU.
When asked whether in the past five years they had considered moving to live and work in another EU member state, 33% of the 1,101 Romanians polled said yes, 67% said no. Of the 1,014 people questioned in Bulgaria - 37% said yes, 63% said no.
When all of those polled were asked to pick their first choice of EU country to move to in either 2013 or 2014, 4.6% of Romanians and 9.3% of Bulgarians chose the UK. These numbers rose to 8.2% for Romanians and 13.6% for Bulgarians when they were asked directly about whether they would consider the UK as a destination.
In the past people from Romania and Bulgaria who have worked in other EU countries have usually opted for places they can reach by car or where the culture and language are closer to their own.
That was still the case among the 197 Romanians who said they were intending to work in another EU country in 2013 - 30% of them said they wanted to go to Italy, 24% to Germany, and 16% to the UK.
However, the Newsnight survey suggested that the UK is becoming a more attractive destination.
When it came to Romanians intending to work in another EU country in 2014, a much smaller group of 73 people, the percentages changed - 25% wanted to go to Italy, 18% to Germany, and 26% to the UK.
Of the 242 Bulgarians who said they intended to work elsewhere in the EU in 2013 - 30% said they wanted to go to Germany, 27% to the UK and 10% to Spain.
As for Bulgarians intending to work elsewhere in the EU in 2014, again a smaller group, 123 people, 31% wanted to go to Germany, 24% to the UK and 12% to Spain.
Some people said one country for 2013 and a different one for 2014 - so they appear twice.
To get a clearer idea of how many people might actually come to the UK, those who had said they were planning to head to the UK were then asked whether they had made any concrete plans to move.
These plans included searching for somewhere to live and to work.
The number of positive responses fell significantly, though more Bulgarians than Romanians were making concrete plans.
Just 1.2% of the Bulgarians and 0.4% of the Romanians said they had begun to look for accommodation.
The numbers were similarly small for those who had started looking for a job - 2.8% of the Bulgarians had started to look for a job with a recruitment agency and 0.3% of the Romanians.
And 1.4% of the Bulgarians and 0.7% of the Romanians had begun to look for work without the aid of a recruitment agency.
With such small numbers analysts say you cannot safely estimate real numbers of how many will come.
"I think if you're looking at who's making concrete plans, say who's spoken for instance to a recruitment consultancy or who has a firm job offer, I think yes the sample sizes there are a bit small to say specifically who are the numbers who are coming," Peter Flade, director of Gallup UK, told BBC Newsnight.
Many of the people who came to the UK from Poland and other eastern European countries did so without a job awaiting them. However, the results of the Newsnight surveys suggest that, for now at least, most Romanians and Bulgarians would only come to the UK with a firm offer of work.
Looking at Romania, of the 90 people who said they were planning to work in the UK, 65% would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
For the 138 Bulgarians answering this question, 60% said they would do so only with an offer from a recruitment agency, or directly from a company.
When looking at what kind of people are interested in moving to the UK, the Bulgarian survey suggested they tend to be younger and they are more likely to be unemployed than the average in the survey.
The Romanian survey suggested people interested in moving to the UK are more likely to have a university degree, more likely to be employed, and are likely to be more affluent than those looking to move elsewhere in the EU.
The surveys were conducted before UK Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech in March suggesting restricting entitlements for new immigrants.
However, Newsnight asked whether the UK government considering restricting state benefits to Romanians and Bulgarians would affect their desire to come to the UK.
Although the 90 Romanian respondents who were interested in working in the UK were more professional and better off than the average respondent in the survey, just under half said it would affect their decision to a great or very great extent.
In Bulgaria, most people interested in working in the UK said a benefits change would not affect their decision.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight Bulgaria's Minister of Economy, Energy and Tourism Assen Vassilev said he did not think there would be a mass exodus of Bulgarians when the changes came into effect.
"I think people who wanted to leave have already left. Gone somewhere, come back, gone somewhere else come back. And going back to the survey that shows that 60-70% of people want a firm job offer. They know that going to a place that looks nice in pictures is not going to make your life better."
NB: When looking at the detailed tables that accompany these polls, it is important to look not just at the percentages, but at the total number of respondents who answer each question. At times this number will comprise the entire sample, a large figure that has been designed to reflect the views of the entire population. However, at other times, the number of people responding to individual questions may be as low as 20 and certainly fewer than 100. The margin of error increases significantly as the number of people answering any question diminishes.
summary EU member states have put limits on their citizens working which end this year.

article The Magna Carta, Winston Churchill and "one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known" were all celebrated in his Westminster Hall speech.
The President was determinedly upbeat.
On Iraq, he said "our combat mission has ended". On Afghanistan, he declared: "We have broken the Taliban's momentum".
He added: "We will not relent until the people of Libya are protected, and the shadow of tyranny is lifted."
At the heart of his speech was the case for the US, the UK and their allies to play a leading role in global politics.
Unlike President Roosevelt and Churchill they could not set right the world over a brandy, he said, but these countries remained the "greatest catalysts for global action".
Members of Parliament who shared their excitement with the world on Twitter just waiting for the President to arrive made their appreciation obvious as he reminded them he was the grandson of a Kenyan who served as a cook in the British Army.
But even before the standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech was complete, they were picking through Barack Obama's state visit comments seeking support for their own political arguments, or evidence of splits with the prime minister.
Earlier, at their joint press conference, David Cameron said: "The president and I agree that we should be turning up the heat in Libya."
It was almost as if he foresaw reporters using folksy pictures of him and President Obama cooking burgers for veterans in the Downing Street garden to illustrate his point.
The President, though, struck a different tone there.
"I think there may be a false perception that there are a whole bunch of secret, super-effective air assets that are in a warehouse somewhere that could just be pulled out and that would immediately solve the situation in Libya," he said.
"That's not the case."
There would be a slow, steady process, he said, and patience was necessary.
Even as the state visit began the US press corps were reminded by the White House that President Obama had told the UK that the US commitment in Libya would be "limited in scope and duration".
The director of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Professor Michael Clarke, said the strikes by US unmanned Predator drones taking place in Libya were the sort of intervention the military coalition opposing Colonel Gaddafi most wanted.
But there were those in the Conservative Party who hoped for more from the President than comments about patience, slow progress and limitations.
One senior Tory backbencher said: "How can he say all that and not help more in Libya?"
The Conservative vice chairman of the party's backbench foreign affairs and defence committee, Mark Pritchard, said: "The United States military is doing much; but the reluctance of President Obama, for primarily domestic political reasons, not to fully commit the United States to the conflict in Libya could unhelpfully prolong the conflict."
Rival British politicians were also listening carefully to the President's words on the economy.
David Cameron sought common ground when he said debt ratios on both sides of the Atlantic would be falling by the second half of this decade - a target set for the UK by the Chancellor.
The President acknowledged the "sequencing or pace" of the two countries' efforts to deal with their deficits could turn out to be different, but said that was down to differences in their economies and the pressures they faced.
He also said both governments wanted to achieve the same ends without mortgaging their futures and leaving a mountain of debt to future generations.
Unsurprisingly both the UK government and opposition drew from those quotes to claim the President's support for their arguments.
Labour said David Cameron would be disappointed the President had refused to support his economic policy.
Government sources suggested he had said everything they would have said about the need for countries to live within their means while protecting spending on infrastructure and technology.
The inevitable arguments about what President Obama really meant, underlined a simple point.
No one could emerge from this state visit doubting America's influence; certainly not David Cameron who hitched a lift in the famous Presidential limousine.
The special relationship, described repeatedly as "essential" during the visit, retains its place at the centre of British foreign policy.
The announcements about collaboration between the US and the UK made public during the press conference served, of course, to underline the point.
As the pageantry and press conferences of the visit played out, the vast US aircraft carrier the USS George H.W. Bush was off the British coast taking part in a major international military training exercise.
Some in David Cameron's party will watch the president leave for the G8 in France wishing the US had promised to commit a little more of that force to the fight to oust Colonel Gaddafi.

article Justice N Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court made the remark while rejecting a plea by a British national accused of sexually abusing a boy
Three children were raped in Delhi earlier this month, sparking outrage.
Two years ago, India tightened its laws on sexual violence after the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student.
However, brutal sexual attacks against women and children continue to be reported across the country.
"When [the] law is ineffective and incapable of addressing the menace, this court cannot keep its hands folded and remain a silent spectator, unmoved and oblivious of the recent happenings of horrible blood-curdling gang rapes of children in various parts of India," Mr Kirubakaran said on Friday.
He said the "court is sure the castration of child rapists will fetch magical results" in curbing crimes against children.
"Though the suggestion of castration looks barbaric, barbaric crimes should definitely attract barbaric models of punishment and the very thought of the punishment should deter the culprit from committing the offence," Mr Kirubakaran said.
He made the observation while dismissing a petition by a British national accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy from the southern state of Tamil Nadu in 2011 after promising his mother that he would take care of his education.
The man, who has returned to Britain, had urged the high court to suspend the proceedings against him in a lower court in Tamil Nadu.

article Friday's South Coast Proms concert was cancelled due to bad weather, with ticket holders offered a refund plus free entry to Saturday's pop concert.
It drew criticism from those who had already paid to attend Saturday's show.
Organisers said the free tickets were a "gesture of goodwill" but made no comment about the complaints.
The two concerts are to mark the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie begins Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup.
Organisers issued a statement on Friday explaining the South Coast Proms concert, featuring the Band of HM Royal Marines, was cancelled for "public safety reasons".
It added it would refund all Friday evening tickets, which cost £25, as well as offer them free tickets for the Portsmouth Live! concert featuring Spandau Ballet, Wet Wet Wet and McBusted.
Those with Saturday tickets - which cost up to £48.50 - took to the event's own Facebook page to complain.
On Friday Martine Halliday posted: "I have paid £131 for three tickets and people who bought tickets for tonight get a full refund and free entry into tomorrow's event. Come on, seriously, sort this out!!!"
Jan Spencer, who said she paid £200 for Saturday tickets, posted: "To give people free tickets to a completely different concert as well as a refund is disgraceful. I'm so very annoyed".
Andy Cottrell posted that the handling of the issue was a "shambles".
Others complained about the prospect of more people attending the Saturday concert, potentially making it crowded and cramped.
A concerts spokeswoman said: "We offered the Saturday night tickets as a gesture of goodwill to many of those who had travelled to Portsmouth and, due to inclement weather conditions, had missed out on their concert opportunity."
summary Bad weather has forced the cancellation of the South Coast Proms concert in Brighton.

Maersk Oil said it was part of a drive to reduce operating costs by 20% by the end of 2016.
The UK jobs are linked to the retirement of the Janice installation, 150 miles south-east of Aberdeen, and changes to the offshore rotation.
Maersk is also scaling back its business in Qatar and Norway, as well as at its Copenhagen headquarters, and in Kazakhstan.
The company said the move followed an "extensive internal review of business activities and continued low oil prices".

article Each unprotected department has been asked to come up with savings plans of 25% and 40% of their budget.
The chancellor said departments had also been asked to help meet a target of 150,000 new homes on public sector land by 2020.
The NHS and per-pupil schools budgets will be protected in the review, which will be published on 25 November.
Mr Osborne, who gave evidence to MPs on Tuesday about the Budget and his spending priorities, said that "with careful management of public money, we can get more for less".
The Treasury said "large savings" would be required of unprotected departments, which have been asked to model two scenarios: of 25% and 40% cuts to their budgets by 2020.
The BBC's economics editor Robert Peston said what was being proposed would require a reinvention of some services taken for granted by the public.
Mr Osborne has already unveiled £12bn of welfare savings plus £5bn of tax avoidance prevention measures - which together with the £20bn of departmental spending cuts make up the £37bn figure earmarked to get government finances back in the black.
Analysis by economics editor Robert Peston
Today I want you to imagine what you would cut from your lifestyle if told that your income would fall by either 25% or 40%, after adjusting for inflation, over the next four years.
It is quite a scary thought, isn't it? Presumably, if you haven't done it already, you'll think about switching the weekly shop to one of those discounters. You will heat up the water for fewer hours. And the kids' swimming lessons will have to go.
But those savings would not even scratch the surface of a 40% cut. To reach that, the kids may have to share a bedroom, so you can take in a paying lodger. And the car would be history.
All of which serves to explain why ministers and officials in all but protected departments and services - that is everything but health, schools, defence and overseas aid - are having panic attacks today.
Because they have been instructed by the chancellor to "model" the impact on the services they provide of finding savings of either 25% or 40% by 2019-20 - or £20bn per annum of cuts in aggregate.  This is the stuff of public-service reinvention, not efficiency.

Spending limits will be set for government departments, which will also be asked to examine the way they manage their assets and consider privatisation and contracting out where necessary.
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said talk of cuts of as much as 40% were just "a ranging shot".
"Past experience would suggest that initial pitching by the Treasury should be regarded as aspirational," he told MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
"But it is clear that to deliver the overall fiscal trajectory departments collectively will have to make substantial savings, double-digit percentage savings."
The review document says it will prioritise spending which: promotes innovation and greater collaboration in public services; promotes growth and productivity including through devolution within England; promotes choice and competition and which drive efficiency and value for money.
Although full details will not be published until November, the document does include some details of specific areas for change.
On local government it says "the government will look at transforming the approach" to its financing and "further decentralising power, in order to maximise efficiency, local economic growth and the integration of public services".
It also sets out plans to sell off publicly owned land that is surplus to requirements, including assets owned by the Ministry of Defence.
The Treasury said the MoD, alone, accounted for 1% of all land in the UK, while the state land holdings were worth £300bn.
Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock told the BBC that £1.5bn of land had been disposed of during the last Parliament and that ministers had only "just started getting going".
"It is clear we can release much, much more," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. "It also contributes to our wider objectives like housebuilding. The two go hand in hand."
But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the scale of the cuts envisaged meant it would take a lot more than "flogging off a few disused airbases" to meet the chancellor's targets.
For Labour, shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told BBC News: "During the Budget speech the chancellor said that he was going to step off the rollercoaster ride in public spending and now he's asking his cabinet colleagues to perhaps think about deeper cuts than he envisaged only a fortnight ago.
"So it's very unclear what the chancellor's coherent approach is here and I think we do need, of course, those sensible savings but he needs to now come clean and say what exactly is he planning."
The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie said some of the targets set for departments were likely to prove "completely unmanageable" and Mr Osborne risked "setting himself up for a very large fall".
"Perhaps he's setting the bar high and he'll appear to be the good guy if it's less when push comes to shove," he said. "I think the key thing is we look at the last parliament. He failed on all these major targets.
"He seems to be wanting to push the boundaries time after time after time. There's no longer fat to be cut. It's into the bone and the impact on services could be catastrophic."

article It failed to pass on the last day of the previous assembly after opposition from Plaid Cymru.
Carwyn Jones told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement the bill would be tabled again without the e-cigs ban.
He said Labour's minority government would also have to rethink its council shake-up plans to win wider support.
"There is no point trying to bang our heads against a brick wall when it comes to e-cigs," he said.
"The public health bill will be brought back to the assembly but, clearly, there is no point including the provisions on e-cigs when we know they are not going to get through."
His comments come at the start of a new assembly term with the minority government requiring support from other parties to pass through plans.
Tobacco control action group ASH Wales has welcomed the minister's decision. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: "The evidence shows that e-cigs are being used as a cessation tool by a significant number of ex-smokers."
The Public Health (Wales) Bill failed to pass at the last assembly after the presiding officer was required, because of a tie, to also vote, bringing the vote to 27 AMs against and 26 for.
As well as the e-cigarette measure, it aimed to create a compulsory licensing system for tattooists, prohibit intimate piercing of children under 16 and require councils to produce a local toilets strategy.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he was "delighted that Labour has been forced to admit that they won't be pursuing this misguided policy".
The failed vote came despite AMs previously backing revised e-cigarette plans.
On local government reorganisation plans, the first minister admitted he would now need to find "common ground" with the other political parties in the Senedd.
Labour has long hoped to cut the number of authorities from 22 to single figures which has been opposed by the Conservatives among others.
He said: "Clearly, the map we published before the election, that is not going to gain support across the assembly, that's obvious.
"But we do need to find a way forward."
Meanwhile, he was adamant that a preferred option for a new M4 relief road south of Newport, known as the black route, was the only way forward.
However, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has previously ruled out any kind of deal with Labour if it pushed the proposals forward.
Speaking on BBC Wales' Sunday Politics, Ms Wood said: "Danger faces the government if it continues to be intransigent".
She said it will need the backing of another party to get policies passed, adding that Plaid Cymru's 12 AMs would "consider very carefully what we do with our votes".
Carwyn Jones said he was just reflecting the arithmetic of the assembly in accepting that there wouldn't be enough support to push ahead with a ban on e-cigs in Wales and cutting the number of councils.
Having Kirsty Williams in the cabinet helps him with the numbers but the first minister has to choose his battles because he needs support from the opposition in order to get his policies, and budgets, through a vote in the Senedd.
Mr Jones says he won't budge on the M4 relief road, which means there's a real stalemate between him and Plaid Cymru. He wants their support on the budget, so it seems something will have to give.
Another tricky situation for Mr Jones is the agreement with Plaid Cymru which paved the way for him to be re-appointed as first minister.
Today we've seen how little detail there was in the agreement. Plaid want more doctors and a big commission to look at infrastructure. Carwyn Jones seemed cool on the idea of the latter, and unclear what Plaid wanted on the former.
With so little detail in the deal, I asked Leanne Wood if she had been conned by the first minister to get into power.  Her answer: "I don't think so." If she starts to think otherwise, Carwyn Jones could find life difficult in the Senedd if the only other left-leaning party refuses to work with him.

article Americans Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan secured 68% of shares in July this year, with the trust retaining 21.1%.
The supporters claim they were not consulted and were not able to buy more shares themselves.
A statement on the Trust's website said it had received legal advice, but no decision had been taken.
"We are conscious any legal action would create uncertainty," the statement said.
"Our first preference has always revolved around protecting our shareholding and influence at the football club.
"[Legal action] remains a last resort, however we have a duty to our members for the best long-term interests of our fans."
The Trust members felt they were not informed of the sale of shares at an early enough stage, and their efforts to increase their own holding to 25% were rebuffed.
Their criticism is not just of Kaplan and Levien but of the previous board members who sold their shares to the Americans.
The Trust was also critical of the majority shareholders over the sacking of manager Francesco Guidolin, and the appointment of successor Bob Bradley.
The Supporters' Trust forum held at the Liberty Stadium was told a barrister had given initial advice, which was still being assessed.
"Our legal options are still being assessed and we will obtain the best guidance we can to ensure the Trust members' best interests are maintained.
"Whilst we have sought an initial opinion from counsel, we have not yet made any firm decisions in terms of the next steps to be taken."
Any legal action against the new owners or the previous shareholders would need the full approval of the Trust Members via a forum or ballot.
Swansea City have so far declined to comment.
summary The trust has been accused of a lack of transparency by its supporters.

article They are still without a Championship win this summer and lost to Notts by an innings and 280 runs on Wednesday, the county's worst defeat in 85 years.
Khan told BBC Radio Leicester their problems were not a reflection of dressing room tensions.
"There are no issues with Pierre de Bruyn. It's 100% nonsense," he said
"These things take time, to understand how people want to work, and Pierre understands the players.
"This is purely around performance. When you step to that white line, I can't help and Pierre can't help the players. These guys are pro cricketers and they've got to go out and do it for themselves."
All-rounder Neil Dexter did not feature against Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire but Khan said his absence was because of "personal issues".
He continued: "People will like to spin conspiracy theories and rumours like he's fallen out with the coach over this and that but it's not the case.
"Pierre and I speak to Neil on a daily basis and we're supporting him through a difficult personal situation that he's got from a family point of view.
"As soon as he is back and he is firing, he will be back playing."
De Bruyn, 40, was promoted to head coach in 2016 after predecessor Andrew McDonald left to coach Australian side Melbourne Renegades.
Despite Leicestershire's winless run this campaign, Khan insists de Bruyn can turn the club's fortunes around.
"I believe in Pierre in terms of his coaching ability, his philosophies and he's passionate about the Foxes," he added.
"He's doing everything he can and he has my full support. Nothing will change overnight so now's not the time to panic."

article The suit alleges that some employees were fired from one franchise because there were "too many black people".
It is being backed by a group campaigning for better wages for fast-food workers and the local Virginia National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
McDonald's has not yet commented specifically on the suit.
McDonalds issued a general statement, saying: "McDonald's has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity of employees, independent franchisees, customers and suppliers, and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values.
"McDonald's and our independent owner-operators share a commitment to the well-being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald's restaurants."
The suit is part of a continuing effort on the part of labour organisers to hold McDonald's responsible for the behaviour of its franchisees.
McDonald's and other restaurant groups have argued that it should not be held responsible for the behaviour and labour practices of franchisees.
However, their position has been weakened by the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
It ruled that McDonalds "could be held jointly liable for labour and wage violations by its franchise operators" in July.
Since then, current and former employees have filed lawsuits against many McDonald's franchises and the larger corporation alleging wage theft and other illegal practices.
In the lawsuit filed in Virginia on Thursday, which is not part of the NLRB's larger activity, 10 former employees - nine of whom are African-American and one of whom is Hispanic - allege that they were subject to "rampant racial and sexual harassment" by supervisors at three restaurants run by McDonald's franchisee Michael Simon.
Mr Simon became franchise operator of the three restaurants in late 2013, when the majority of the employees at the restaurants were African-American.
Soon after, the suit alleges Mr Simon instituted a plan to hire more white employees, with supervisors allegedly telling employees that the restaurants were "too dark" and they needed to hire new employees to "get the ghetto out of the store".
Subsequently, in mid-2014, a large number of white employees were hired and several of the African-American employees who are part of the suit were fired.
The fired workers alleged that when they attempted to contact McDonald's corporate office, there was no response.
McDonald's is due to report its fourth-quarter earnings before US markets open on Friday.

article Retired teacher Roger Whitworth compiled a huge dossier of pictures of the Worcester City Ancient Arms and the Worcester City Modern Arms.
The heraldic emblems can be seen on buildings, bins, benches, gates and even a radiator cover.
The city council received the Corporate Heraldry Award at a ceremony in London.
The accolade, sponsored by the national Heraldry Society is given twice a year to recognise how coats of arms strengthen a place or organisation's identity.
Worcester City's ancient arms feature a castle while the modern arms have the addition of three black pears.
Mr Whitworth, a former lecturer who runs a genealogy business, entered the city for the award.
He wrote in detail about how the people of Worcester identify the council and the city using the crests.
Floreat Semper Fidelis Civitas - Let the faithful city ever flourish
Civitas in bello et pace fidelis  - In war and peace, a faithful city
Semper fidelis mutare sperno  - Ever faithful, I scorn to change
"We are delighted that Worcester's commitment to its heraldic heritage and the importance of the city crest has been recognised nationally," said Councillor Lucy Hodgson, the council's cabinet member for history and heritage.
"This award can only help to strengthen Worcester's case to gain Heritage City status in 2016."

article Rugby union to the uninitiated, football-fanatic teenager is a mystifying thing. But could a home World Cup in England change that?
Some of the children at Loreto High School in Manchester could hardly afford boots when their PE teacher James Hyland introduced rugby three years ago.
But the Rugby Football Union's (RFU) All Schools programme has enabled 400 state secondary schools, including Loreto, to afford to get rugby off the ground - as well as some footwear.
"The kids had never touched a rugby ball in their lives," says Hyland, whose school has gone from having no rugby union, to fielding a boys' team at every age level and fostering a link with local amateur club Broughton Park.
"We had our first training session and they were throwing the ball forwards, trying to trip people up as they went past and wearing their old trainers.
"It was starting with the basics. Some of them had never even seen a game on TV."
The lack of rugby at Loreto High School puzzled student Calum Conner Jones, a winger for Broughton Park, when he joined. So he did something about it.
"I asked if we could start a rugby team. I had a chat with Mr Hyland and they were all for it," says the 15-year-old.
"A lot of the boys weren't really bothered about rugby. They wouldn't have even known there was a club down the road.
"Now a lot of them go and play. One guy had never played before and after a year had a trial with Lancashire."
Union, for so long derided for its reputation as a game for the privileged, has struggled to gain traction in football-dominated state schools, particularly in the north.
"One of our greatest objectives was to change the perception that rugby is an exclusive sport - and it is a perception," says Steve Grainger, the RFU's development director.
"We wanted to really hit schools that perhaps rugby could have the greatest impact on - ones with low numbers of A-C grades at GCSE and free school meals - they're a good indicator of a school's social-economic background."
Loreto, according to Hyland, has a diverse student population, with about "30-40%" from middle-class backgrounds and the remainder from "very deprived" backgrounds.
It sits on the fringes of leafy Didsbury and the poorer inner-city areas of Moss Side and Whalley Range.
Broughton's link with the school has seen the club stretch its demographic beyond its traditional, private school recruitment.
Last year, Broughton had six players in its under-six programme - this season they have 21. And most of their U15s and U16s players have come through the All Schools programme.
"We are such a mix of social diversity. We have children that go to public school but we also have children that go to state schools," says youth secretary Pippa Ranson.
"They're out there and they just play. Some children have gone to grammars, some to comprehensives, they're still playing rugby together."
Teacher Hyland came to realise the gap between the most privileged and impoverished of his students when he took a group on a funded trip to Twickenham.
"One boy lives with his granddad and has never been out of Manchester," says Hyland, who himself plays for North Manchester.
"I don't think he'd stayed in a hotel before and was like 'I've got my own bathroom?'.
"At breakfast he piled his plate with everything. He didn't understand the concept of a buffet breakfast - he had never seen one. That for me was the main eye opener of how deprived some of the children are.
"He's really come out of his shell now since playing rugby."
There are, of course, gaps in the system. Loreto has undoubtedly excelled at starting rugby in the school because it has a PE teacher who is passionate about the sport.
Other schools would not have found it as easy - although just two schools of the 400 that have taken funding have dropped out of the system.
There have also been missed opportunities. The Uruguay squad used Broughton as a training base before their group game against England in Manchester, but none of the club's youngsters were given an opportunity to interact with the World Cup players.
That was, admittedly, down to tournament organisers and not the RFU - and local children did interact with England players in Eccles just days after the hosts' disappointing exit from the competition.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Then there is the question of where girls fit into the equation.
The RFU says one in three children affected by the All Schools programme are girls - a figure Grainger describes as "light years ahead of where we were a decade ago".
Regardless of how corporate strategies and development targets are played out, the 2015 World Cup's biggest influence on youngsters could well be its spectacle - the action seen in stadiums and on TV from arguably the greatest union World Cup of all time.
Clubs were warned to expect an upturn in interest of 33% during the World Cup, although we might never know whether curiosity towards the sport was dampened by England's early exit.
Regardless, it is how that interest endures, years down the line, that will be the true test of the World Cup's legacy.
"The reports from rugby clubs I've been to have said they've had more youngsters come down," said Grainger.
"I've seen more kids throwing rugby balls around than I've ever seen before.
"If by 2019 we don't have more membership at clubs and more children playing in schools, we'll be saying it won't have worked. But I'll expect more people to be playing rugby."

article Kirkersville police Chief Steven Eric Disario, 36 - only recently appointed - was among the dead, his deputies told US media.
Two employees were found dead inside the Pine Kirk Care Center, and Disario was found outside the building.
The authorities have not given a motive for the shooting, and have not identified the other victims.
It is unclear if the gunman killed himself or whether he had a relationship with any of the victims.
Disario had only taken over the job about three weeks ago, Licking County Sheriff Randy Thorp told reporters on Friday afternoon.
He had six children, and one more "on the way", Mr Thorp said, adding that "it's a real hard day for all of us".
"It's just a tragic event," Mr Thorp said, adding that Disario had been responding to reports of a man with a gun when he was shot around 08:00 local time.
"I believe the last radio transmission we had from (Disario) was that he had the subject in sight," he said.
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the accused shooter took two hostages in an alley, but both were released unharmed.
The 23 residents of the nursing home, who barricaded themselves inside during the shooting, have been moved so that investigators can analyse the crime scene.
Kirkersville is a small village about 25 miles (40km) outside Columbus, the capital of Ohio.
A primary school near the shooting scene was placed on lockdown, and classes were later cancelled for the day.
Governor John Kasich has taken to Twitter to pay his condolences, also ordering that flags at the state capitol fly at half-mast.
"Ohio mourns the loss of Kirkersville Chief Eric Disario, who died in the line of duty," he wrote, adding "blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God".

article About 90 machine gun rounds were fired at the object, which has not been identified. North Korea has flown drones over the border in the past.
In a statement, the South Korean military said it was "maintaining high vigilance".
The incident comes amid continuing high tension on the Korean peninsula.
On Sunday Pyongyang conducted what it said was a successful test of a medium-range ballistic missile.
That test came a week after North Korea tested what it said was a new type of rocket capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead.
The pace of North Korean missile tests has increased in recent months and experts fear it indicates progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile that could strike the continental US.
The UN Security Council is to hold a closed-door meeting on North Korea on Tuesday evening. In a statement on Monday, it agreed to "take further significant measures including sanctions" to force North Korea to end its "highly destabilising behaviour".
The spike in tensions comes with a new president in South Korea. Moon Jae-in was sworn into office earlier this month after the previous leader, Park Geun-hye, was impeached. She is now on trial for corruption.
Mr Moon has adopted a more conciliatory stance than his predecessor, calling for more dialogue with the North.
South Korean military officials did not say whether they hit or secured the object that flew across the demilitarised zone, but similar incidents have occurred in the past.
In January 2016, South Korean border troops fired shots at a suspected drone.
In 2014, South Korean officials said they found two North Korean drones, one south of the demilitarised zone near Paju and the other on an island near the disputed inter-Korean maritime border.

article In Vanity Fair magazine, Monica Lewinsky, 40, writes that she deeply regrets the fling.
The president "took advantage" of her, she writes, though she describes their relationship as consensual.
In 1998, Republicans failed in their effort to oust him from office on the grounds he had lied about the affair.
But with Mr Clinton's wife Hillary said to be mulling a 2016 run for the presidency, the Lewinsky matter has re-emerged in US political discourse, in part because Republicans are eager to wield it against her.
In an advance excerpt from the article released by Vanity Fair, Ms Lewinsky writes she hopes to reclaim her story and says she is still recognised every day and sees her name thrown about in pop culture and the news media.
"I, myself, deeply regret what happened between me and President Clinton," she writes.
"Let me say it again: I. Myself. Deeply. Regret. What. Happened."
Ms Lewinsky writes that she suffered abuse and humiliation after the scandal broke in 1998, in part because she was made a "scapegoat" to protect the president.
"The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor's minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me," she wrote.
"And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power."
Since leaving the Clinton administration, she worked briefly as a handbag designer and as the host of a US reality dating show.
Ms Lewinsky then moved to London for a graduate degree, but said she has had difficulty gaining employment in the US because of her past.
Arguing Mr Clinton had lied to federal investigators about his relationship with Ms Lewinsky, who was in her early 20s, the Republicans in the House of Representatives impeached the president, essentially bringing him up on charges in the Senate to determine whether he could be expelled from office.
That effort failed, and Mr Clinton served in the White House until his term ended in 2000.
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, went on to be elected US senator and to serve as secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and is currently tipped as a frontrunner for the Democratic 2016 presidential nomination.
The Republicans have indicated recently that Mr Clinton's affair with Ms Lewinsky will be fair game should Mrs Clinton indeed run.
Republican Senator Rand Paul - also tipped to run for the presidency in 2016 - said this year that "bosses shouldn't prey on young interns in their office".
Mr Clinton "took advantage of a girl that was 20-years-old and an intern in his office", he added. "There is no excuse for that and that is predatory behaviour."
In her piece, Ms Lewinsky signals that her desire in breaking her silence after so many years is to "give a purpose" to her past.
"Perhaps by sharing my story, I reasoned, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation," she writes.
Ms Lewinsky now aims "to get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums".

article Unemployed father-of-17 Philpott was jailed for life on Thursday for killing six of his children in a house fire.
Mr Osborne said there was a "question for government and society" about the influence of benefits on behaviour.
But Labour condemned the comments as "a cynical act of a desperate chancellor".
Philpott was convicted of manslaughter, along with his wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley, over an arson revenge plot that went wrong.
Much of the coverage of the trial focused on Philpott's lifestyle and the fact that his wife and his mistress Lisa Willis had lived with him at the three-bedroom council house in Derby with 11 of their children until Miss Willis moved out in February 2012.
By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News
When politicians talk about a subject as shocking as the Philpott case they know they will grab voters' attention.
George Osborne has sent out the message that he thinks there is a link between Mick Philpott's lifestyle and the welfare debate.
Ed Balls has accused Osborne of playing politics with a human tragedy.
There are risks for both sides.
Voters may think the Conservatives are making political hay from a unique and horrific crime.
They may think Labour sounds insufficiently tough on welfare.
Or they may just think this is another round in a long fight between two big political beasts.
Philpott received more than ??8,000 a year in child benefit for his 11 children, as well as the income support and wages paid to his wife and mistress, which went into his bank account.
He had already achieved tabloid notoriety as "Shameless Mick" and "Britain's biggest scrounger" before his trial began.
In 2006 he appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show, on ITV, to demand a bigger council house.
Mr Osborne, who has been defending government cuts to housing benefit and other welfare changes, which came into force this week, said: "Philpott is responsible for these absolutely horrendous crimes and these are crimes that have shocked the nation; the courts are responsible for sentencing him.
"But I think there is a question for government and for society about the welfare state - and the taxpayers who pay for the welfare state - subsidising lifestyles like that, and I think that debate needs to be had."
But, in a blog post, Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls was highly critical of his opposite number, saying: "George Osborne's calculated decision to use the shocking and vile crimes of Mick Philpott to advance a political argument is the cynical act of a desperate chancellor."
Mr Balls demanded "a proper debate about welfare reform".
"But for the chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office," he added.
Former Liberal Democrat education minister Sarah Teather joined in the criticism, saying she was "shocked and appalled that George Osborne has stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic deaths of six young children".
"It is deeply irresponsible for such a senior politician to seek to capitalise on public anger about this case, and in doing so demonise anybody who receives any kind of welfare support," the MP for Brent Central said.
"Mr Philpott should be held fully accountable for his awful actions and it is reprehensible to seek to explain it away by blaming the welfare system which Osborne has been so happy to wage war on."
But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps backed the chancellor.
He said: "I think we should be proud of having a welfare system that looks after the most vulnerable in our society.  It's a proper safety net.  Of course there a proper debate to be had about where this should begin and end, and of course that case highlighted some of the extremes."
Philpott has been told he will serve a minimum of 15 years in prison, while Mairead and Mosley were told they would serve at least half of their 17-year sentences.
During the trial, the prosecuting lawyer told the jury: "Michael Philpott did not want to work. He just wanted a house full of kids and the benefit money that brings."
Mr Osborne has dismissed claims that his benefit reforms mark the end of the welfare state as "shrill, headline-seeking nonsense", arguing instead that they encourage people to work rather than rely on payments.

article United Utilities needs to stop taking supplies from Ennerdale Water in the Lake District, which is a protected wildlife  habitat.
Instead it wants a new 62-mile (100km) pipeline from Thirlmere reservoir to provide water to about 150,000 people.
Allerdale Council is the final local authority in the county to approve the company's planning application.
United Utilities estimates the project, which also includes new treatment works and pumping stations, will create about 400 jobs.
Areas around Whitehaven, Egremont, Workington, Maryport, Cockermouth and Wigton will receive their water via the new pipeline when it is completed in 2022.
The route will roughly follow the A591 from Thirlmere to a planned new treatment works near Cockermouth.
The plan was approved by Allerdale Council despite objections from several groups including Friends of the Lake District and the Ramblers, who claimed it would significantly damage the landscape.
United Utilities said water extraction from Ennerdale had to stop to meet EU environmental regulations and to prevent predicted shortages to supplies.
A spokesman added: "This is the culmination of several years of detailed planning and consultation.
"We've worked to develop a scheme which delivers major long-term benefits for west Cumbria, while seeking to minimise traffic inconvenience and safeguarding the environment during construction.
"The new scheme will ease the pressure on sensitive local water sources and provide a more secure supply for homes and businesses for the decades to come."
Work on the new pipeline is due to begin in March 2017.

article Back then, some 2,500 people died and more than 7,000 were injured. Thankfully, we are not expecting loss of life on that scale here.
In part this is because of the strides made in recent years in improving readiness and reaction.
But the fact that the population of central Italy is currently living on such an acute alert status also will have further limited any dreadful consequences.
We have now seen three Magnitude-6 tremors in Italy's Apennines region in just three months.
Quakes 'ever present for Apennines'
BBC Science: Earthquakes
The first, in August, was a 6.2. This was followed mid-week by a 6.1. Initial calculations put Sunday's event at 6.6, which in terms of the energy released is actually four times bigger than the quake in August.
Every time there is a rumble, the population's response will be rapid, and saved seconds save lives.
For example, Wednesday's tremor was immediately preceded by a 5.5 foreshock, which would have had many people scurrying for the open streets, putting them safely out of harm's way when the big tremor hit two hours later.
Many Apennines residents will of course be asking why there have been so many large quakes in so short a time frame. But this is often how the geology works.
"This is an earthquake sequence; these are related events," explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK.
"And this triggering of multiple events, sometimes a few days or weeks apart, is well known behaviour."
Look back to 1997 or as far back as 1703, and this clustering in time and space is seen in the same region of Italy.
Scientists are having to move fast, though, to keep on top of what exactly is occurring and to try to join the dots.
The big picture is reasonably well understood. Wider tectonic forces in the Earth's crust have led to the Apennines being pulled apart at a rate of roughly 3mm per year - about a 10th of the speed at which your fingernails grow.
But this stress is then spread across a multitude of different faults that cut through the mountains. And this network is fiendishly complicated.
It does now look as though August's event broke two neighbouring faults, starting on one known as the Laga and then jumping across to one called the Vettore.
The mid-week tremors appear to have further broken the northern end of the Vettore. But both in August and mid-week, it seems only the top portions of the faults have gone, and the big question is whether the deeper segments have now failed in the latest event.
Experts on the ground will be looking for scarps where the soil has split. Dr Laura Gregory from Leeds University, UK, is currently on the scene.
"We're doing monitoring using GPS receivers to look at how the ground is moving in the aftermath of these events.
"We're also looking at the surface expression of the earthquake as well because this can tell you a lot about earthquakes in general and about the earthquakes in this region," she told BBC News.
"It's very important research to do. We still don't really know enough about these earthquakes and we want to get better at forecasting them."
If Sunday's event has broken the lower portions of the faults then surface evidence may be sparse.
Further information will come from the radar satellites that will overfly the Apennines region in the coming days to map the quake zone.
Their pictures will be compared with space images acquired before Sunday's big tremor to see how the rocks have moved.
Europe's Sentinel-1 mission was launched specifically with this kind of work in mind.
Sentinel-1 actually comprises two spacecraft that have already revealed considerable insight into the August quake and its connection with Wednesday's double tremor.
One of the satellites is due to sweep over the Apennines again on Monday.
"We'll then know if it is the deeper extent of both faults that has gone this time," said Dr Walters.
"This would be what we call 'depth segmentation' where the shallow portions break followed by the deeper portions. And it means you can have an earthquake repeating more frequently on the same faults."

article A newly established group has been chosen by Brighton and Hove City Council to run the parade and ticketed festival in Preston Park.
Pride Brighton and Hove will donate Â£1 of every ticket sold to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender charities.
In areport the council said the event had not been "financially successful"for the previous organisers, Pride South East.
The event, which is usually held in August, will now take place on 1 September due to pressures from the London 2012 Olympics.
One of the organisers, Michael Deol, said the festival was integral to Brighton's economy.
"The annual event has ensured a fantastic summer boom for businesses across the city from guest houses and hotels to restaurants, shops and clubs," he said.
A council spokeswoman said it received two proposals for running Pride.
"Pride Brighton and Hove are a new community interest company that has committed to ring fence a proportion of ticket income from the planned park event to go directly to charity to benefit the local LGBT community," she said.
"Pride is an important event for the city - not only for residents and visitors but also our economy."

article The 24-year-old England international is now committed to the Premier League club until 2021 and there is the option to extend the deal by a further year.
Lingard has made 70 appearances for United, who he joined as a seven-year-old, and won four caps for his country.
"Manchester United has always been a big part of my life," said Lingard.
"I feel great pride every time I pull the shirt on."
Lingard holds the rare distinction of scoring in three successive games for his club at Wembley.
After netting the winner in last season's FA Cup final, Lingard also scored against Leicester in the Community Shield and Southampton as United won the EFL Cup in February.
"To have scored in two cup finals for my boyhood club were immensely proud moments for me and my family," he added.
"As a team, we have already won a major trophy this season and I look forward to helping us win many more under this great manager."
United boss Jose Mourinho said: "Jesse is a popular member of the squad and I am delighted he has signed a new contract.
"He has good intelligence which, when combined with his energy and ability, makes for a player with a great future ahead of him."
Lingard had spells on loan at Leicester, Birmingham and Brighton before he was given his first-team debut by Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal against Swansea in the opening game of the 2014-15 season.
This season he has played 29 times, scoring five goals.

article Lisa Cobbold, 24, was pictured with non-league side Needham Market after a bridge collapse closed the M20 in Kent.
The team did not get her name but wanted to know if she made it to her wedding.
When friends saw her picture, she contacted the BBC from Las Vegas.
The Suffolk-based team, who were heading to an away game at Folkestone when they got stuck in the traffic jam on 27 August, were delighted to hear she became Mrs Kendall later that day - albeit two hours later than planned.
More news from Suffolk
Mrs Kendall, from Welling, London, was heading to Detling when her two wedding vehicles, decked in ribbons, ground to a halt.
"I wasn't too worried as we were 15 minutes away, but then people showed us news reports about the bridge," she said.
The pedestrian bridge over the M20 collapsed after being hit by a lorry carrying a digger.
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when he threw himself from his bike to avoid hitting the bridge.
Mrs Kendall spotted the football team watching an impromptu cricket game on the closed carriageway.
"I didn't know who they were, but they were lovely lads and even said we could use the toilet on their coach," she said.
She had her photograph taken with them and the team later posted it on their website, saying they wanted to make sure she got to the church on time and congratulate her.
"Jake and I were on our honeymoon in Las Vegas when I got all these messages from people saying I was on the news.
"I said to Jake, 'it's OK, I'm only on the BBC'."
Mrs Kendall had made it to her wedding two hours late after part of the road was reopened.
"Everyone parted and let us go first. The football players all cheered as we drove through," she said.
Mrs Kendall, who changed into her wedding gown at the venue, said her husband-to be joked: "You like to keep me waiting, don't you. I thought you'd stood me up."
Mark Easlea, Needham Market FC's secretary, said the team "wishes them all the best for the future".

article A total of 67 families will be represented by the same legal team as they seek compensation over the scandal at Aberdeen's Hazlehead Crematorium.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at the crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
Aberdeen City Council announced in December last year that it had approved a new financial compensation scheme for those affected.
The deadline for claims has been set for 1 February.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
It followed similar revelations about Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh, which had been secretly burying baby ashes for decades.
A report into the scandal by Dame Elish Angiolini described the practices as "abhorrent".
Thompsons Solicitors said they originally represented 21 families but that had risen to 67 as the compensation deadline looms.
Company partner Patrick McGuire said the compensation announcement was justification for the families "who had fought for years to get the council to acknowledge the wrongs done to them".
He added: "I have rarely seen such a large amount of people contacting us in such a short space of time.
"I think what this actually shows is the number of families in the Aberdeen area that have been touched by this scandal and have suffered in silence. They no longer need to do so."

article Christopher Meli, 20, was discovered on Saturday near houses at Glasvey Close.
Police said the youths, two aged 18 and one aged 16, had been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.
They are also investigating a serious assault on another young man who was in the company of Mr Meli.
He was taken to hospital, but later discharged.
Mr Meli's mother Vanessa Burke said her son was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
"I believe that Christopher died a very violent death," she said.
"I know in my heart and soul he was calling me, I believe he was calling me, or both of us. Me and Christopher were close, anyone who knows us, knows how close we were."
Speaking on Sunday, Det Ch Insp Gareth Talbot said: "After examination by ambulance staff the man was pronounced dead at the scene. A number of injuries were noted on the body and as such, we are treating this death as murder."
Police appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
John McPoland from the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said a crew attended the scene.
"At 12:50 GMT on Saturday the ambulance service received a call from a resident in the Glasvey Close area reporting that there was a young man lying on the street with blood coming from his head," he said.
"He did indicate to us at the time that he felt the young man was dead.
"We did send a crew up to the scene and unfortunately they found that the person was deceased at the scene and they stayed until the police arrived and assisted the police as best they could."
Sinn FÃ©in MLA Jennifer McCann said she was "shocked" to hear about the death.
"I have spoken to the local PSNI and they tell me they are treating it as a violent death," she said.
"My thoughts and prayers are with this young man's family at this time and I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward to the PSNI."

article The 40-year-old from South Lanarkshire had been in a "stable" condition at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
She was put on an RAF Hercules aircraft which took her to London where she was taken to  the Royal Free Hospital.
Ms Cafferkey was treated there twice in 2015 after contracting Ebola in Sierra Leone the previous year.
A spokesman for the Royal Free said she had been transferred to the hospital "due to a late complication from her previous infection by the Ebola virus".
The spokesman added: "She will now be treated by the hospital's infectious diseases team under nationally agreed guidelines.
"The Ebola virus can only be transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person while they are symptomatic so the risk to the general public remains low and the NHS has well established and practised infection control procedures in place."
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said Ms Cafferkey had been admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow "under routine monitoring by the Infectious Diseases Unit".
The health board said she was "undergoing further investigations and her condition remains stable".
Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "I'd like to thank the expert NHS staff in Glasgow who have looked after her and helped with her transfer to the Royal Free Hospital, where Pauline has been treated before and where clinicians agreed it would be best to continue her treatment."
The nurse, from Halfway, Cambuslang, contracted the virus while working as part of a British team at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment centre.
She spent almost a month in isolation at the Royal Free at the beginning of 2015 after the virus was detected when she arrived back in the UK.
Ms Cafferkey was later discharged after apparently making a full recovery, and in March 2015 returned to work as a public health nurse at Blantyre Health Centre in South Lanarkshire.
In October last year it was discovered that Ebola was still present in her body, with health officials later confirming she had been diagnosed with meningitis caused by the virus.
Ebola is a viral illness of which the initial symptoms can include a sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). And that is just the beginning: subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - both internal and external bleeding.
The disease infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope.
It then spreads between humans by direct contact with infected blood, bodily fluids or organs, or indirectly through contact with contaminated environments. Even funerals of Ebola victims can be a risk, if mourners have direct contact with the body of the deceased.
Ebola outbreaks occur primarily in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests, says the WHO.
The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014, and rapidly became the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.
Almost two years on from the first confirmed case recorded on 23 March 2014, more than 11,000 people have been reported as having died from the disease in six countries; Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali.
The total number of reported cases is almost 29,000.
On 13 January, 2016, the World Health Organisation declared the last of the countries affected, Liberia, to be Ebola-free.
Bodily tissues can harbour the Ebola infection months after the person appears to have fully recovered.
Dr Derek Gatherer, lecturer in the Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University, said it was "now becoming clear that Ebola is a far more complex disease than we previously imagined".
He said: "The meningitis that Ms Cafferkey suffered from at the end of last year is one of the most serious complications of all, as it can be life-threatening.
"The other main rare serious complication is inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis and/or uveitis) which can lead to blindness, especially if supportive treatments are unavailable."
Dr Gatherer said major post-recovery complications included "joint aches, headaches and general tiredness which can last for months".

article The GM Health and Social Care Partnership Board said the move would make 24/7 urgent primary care provision easier for patients to access.
The additional access will revolve around neighbourhood hubs and "clusters" where weekend and evening appointments will be available.
The board said it hopes the plans will reduce pressure on hospital A&E units.
The investment will also provide patients access to a range of other health and social care services such as diagnostics, blood tests and X-rays as well as supporting nursing and residential homes.
Partnership chairman Lord Peter Smith said: "This £41m investment will ensure that our GPs across Greater Manchester are supported to provide high quality care now and in the future.
"Putting primary care back at the heart of our local communities is absolutely the right thing to do and shows how devolution can make gains for patients' right across Greater Manchester."
The plans do not mean that every GP practice in the region will have extra opening hours.
Instead it is envisaged patients having enhanced access at the neighbourhood level through "clusters" of practices working together, supported by a designated hub serving around 50,000 patients.
Dr David Wrigley, a Lancashire GP and BMA Council Deputy Chair, said: "It is good to hear about some new investment into general practice but I am concerned seven-day routine working is being rolled out when GPs struggle to provide a good five-day service, Monday to Friday, due to the years of under investment.
"We are short of thousands of GPs across the country and this new seven-day plan will seek to stretch my colleagues even more thinly across the week."
The board, which took control of the region's £6bn health and social care budget in 2016, was told 2,500 patients who could be treated elsewhere are dealt with every day in A&E units across the region.
The plan will build on some schemes already in operation in Greater Manchester, such as in Bury.
Bury has had full extended GP access in place since January 2015 with weekday appointments available up to 20:00, and from 08:00 to 18:00 at weekends, delivered from three hub sites.
Surgeries in England are currently expected to open between 08:00 and 18:30 on weekdays with extra funding available to those offering slots outside those hours.

article In Taksim Square, where the heart of this city beats, there is a group of people wrapped up in Turkish flags, shouting "God is great!" in protest at the coup attempt and in support of the government.
This place would normally be packed with tourists, street musicians and people out shopping or having a drink in one of many bars. Now it feels edgy, angry and sad.
"What is happening to our country?" asks an old man. "Brothers are up in arms against each other," meaning the clashes between the coup-plotting soldiers and the security forces loyal to President Erdogan's government.
"I fear there will be more bloodshed. Do you think we will be like Syria?" he asks.
It has been an overwhelming night and day for millions of Turks, glued to their television screens and Twitter feeds, trying to figure out what was happening.
First, the pictures from Istanbul emerged, showing the major bridge over the Bosphorus seized by soldiers. People started to ask: Could this be a coup attempt?
As panic struck, the unease started spreading from adults to children. I was then still in Izmir, the third biggest city in Turkey, trying desperately to make my way to Istanbul.
The 11-year-old son of a friend travelling with me was in shock, crying, not knowing exactly what was happening and asking his father whether Turkey was at war now. His father tried to console him: "Everything will be OK."
Soon after the prime minister confirmed that this was indeed a coup attempt, carried out by a faction within the army, I saw people queuing in front of bakeries to buy bread, at petrol stations to buy fuel, at ATMs to withdraw as much money as they could.
It felt surreal - even for a country that has witnessed three coups and two further military interventions in the past.
Live pictures from Istanbul showed a local news channel's premises being raided when it was still on air. Soldiers were not seen on camera, but scuffles were heard. And gunfire.
People were constantly tweeting about the explosions: Was that a sound bomb or a major attack nearby, they were asking.
In the capital city Ankara, scenes were even more dramatic. Gunfire on the streets, tanks on the march, jets flying low over government buildings, helicopters hovering over the parliament.
At one point during the night, millions of Turkish citizens watched their parliament come under fire by helicopter attack live on television. The MPs shared their latest whereabouts on Twitter - taking refuge, packed in the shelters.
Never in Turkey's modern history had parliament been hit - even at the most turbulent times. It was a significant moment, symbolising the wound opened in the heart of Turkish democracy.
Almost everything was live on air. President Erdogan's in-vision call to a news channel was one of the iconic moments, when he called on everyone to take to the streets. Many imams repeated his call from mosques via megaphones. "We call on all to go out to public squares," they said.
And crowds answered the call. Soon there emerged pictures of men on top of tanks, beaten-up soldiers, jubilant anti-coup protestors. Dozens of rebels abandoned their positions.
The government says the coup attempt is over, blaming the movement supporting US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. They deny any sort of involvement.
But after at least 265 dead, 1,440 wounded, nearly 3,000 soldiers arrested, and more than 2,700 judges dismissed, many Turks wonder: how will Turkey cope with the trauma it just went through?

article Flowers, 63, was arrested last November after newspaper allegations he had been involved in a drug deal.
The suspended Methodist minister had stepped down from the Co-op six months earlier over concerns about expenses.
He was fined £400 and ordered to pay £125 in costs after pleading guilty to charges of possessing cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine.
He had earlier apologised for "stupid and wrong" behaviour, saying he had been under pressure because of problems at the bank and the recent death of his mother.
During the 10-minute hearing on Wednesday, prosecutors said Flowers had been filmed handing over £300 for drugs in a car in Leeds last November.
The footage was subsequently sold to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, the judge was told.
Flowers admitted the offence to police and said he had taken cocaine for about 18 months to "keep himself going" while he was suffering stress and caring for his then terminally ill mother.
Flowers' barrister, Richard Wright QC, said his client had a current income of £510 a month from pensions and unspecified assets inherited from his mother.
Outside court, Flowers said only: "Don't ask me any questions because I won't give any answers."
His appearance in court came on the day a review of the Co-op Group by former board member Lord Myners said the organisation should adopt a much smaller board and focus on being profitable in order to survive.
Lord Myners said the group's current board was "manifestly dysfunctional" and needed more members with business experience.
Flowers, who oversaw the near-collapse of the group's banking arm, previously served as a Labour councillor in Bradford and on an informal board advising Labour leader Ed Miliband on banking.
He was suspended by the Labour Party and the Methodist Church following the drug allegations and faces a disciplinary procedure by the Church.
His appointment as Co-op Bank chairman in April 2010 was widely criticised because of his inexperience in banking.
In May last year, the Co-op Bank was found to have a £1.5bn black hole in its finances.
Flowers stepped down the following month.
In November, Flowers was called to appear before Parliament's Treasury Select Committee to discuss his management of the bank.
After his appearance, the committee's chairman Andrew Tyrie said Flowers was "manifestly unsuitable" to be chairman of a bank.
The bank has since agreed a refinancing deal which saw the Co-op Group's stake fall to 30%.
US institutions now hold the other 70%.
Flowers is also a former trustee of the drugs charity Lifeline, from which he resigned in 2004 after allegedly filing false expenses claims.

article He is passionate about a species of which its mere existence is hotly debated: Wild big cats in the UK.
"I know they are out there," said Mr Tunbridge, who has spent nearly 25 years investigating Gloucestershire's reported big cats.
He said that on average he received two sightings a week from across the county.
His passion is equalled by that of Rick Minter, 50, who has written a book about big cats in the wilds of Britain.
"The main candidates for the larger types of feral big cats being reported in Britain are puma-type cats and panthers," he said.
"A puma is a sandy-grey coloured cat, also known as cougar and mountain lion. A black panther is biologically a leopard or a jaguar in its black form."
Mr Minter admitted some people just found the idea of big cats roaming wild in the English countryside too incredible to believe.
"You do feel largely like you are beavering away in your own little world," he said.
"Then, suddenly January 2012 comes along and half the nation's media are tracking your every step.
"You're suddenly engulfed with emails and reporters and programmes wanting to know about the latest deer carcass or your view on 'X' in relation to big cats."
The incident he refers to came about when the National Trust announced that it had called for DNA tests to be carried out on a deer carcass found on its land near Stroud, Gloucestershire.
A trust spokesman had initially said the deer's injuries - and way the carcass had been eaten by its killer - were thought to be "highly indicative of big cat activity".
But three weeks later the results are back and they are negative to the idea of a big cat predator. Fox and deer DNA are the only traces found on the swabs taken.
But Mr Tunbridge said he still believed the big cats were out there - and said he had his own close encounter to prove it.
"It was dead quiet," he said, remembering a night he spent tracking wildlife near Minchampton, Stroud, last September.
"You could hear a pin drop, and this big cat growled behind me - just warning me.
"Through my night vision equipment I just saw it swoop down, sweep up a rabbit and disappear into a small wood.
"They are so elusive, so stealthy - especially leopards and pumas - they see you before you see them."
Mr Minter, meanwhile, said he had seen three big cats in the wild - a black panther in Cumbria, a puma-like cat in a Cotswold woodland and a smaller cat, "like a jungle cat", near the River Severn in Gloucester.
Between June 2007 and April 2011, Gloucestershire Police took 38 calls about big cat sightings.
According to the force's records, most of the animals were described as large black cats although there was one reported sighting of a lion.
So, why would big cats be found in the far-from-tropical conditions of the Cotswolds?
Both of the big cat hunters said they believed the most likely explanation is that such animals have been released from domestic situations and small private collections.
Following the introduction of the 1976 Dangerous Wild Animals Act, more costly and rigorous conditions were applied for keeping such animals.
Natural England, the government's advisory body on the natural environment, has stated it is confident there is no breeding big cat population in this country.
A spokesman said reports were occasionally received, but no sightings had ever been confirmed and the evidence it had looked at had either been unsubstantiated or attributed to other causes.
But this is not the line taken by those who are convinced they have seen, heard or tracked a big cat in the wild.
As for DNA testing of animal carcasses, previous cases have shown up different results, Mr Minter said.
He claimed that in 2003, tests on a black animal hair found after a sighting in Lincolnshire gave positive results for a leopard.
Two years later, DNA results consistent with a puma were found on a hair recovered after sightings in Neath, South Wales.
And in 2009 the  
          Forestry Commission confirmed
 that rangers had twice spotted big cats while conducting deer surveys in the Forest of Dean.
"Recent community surveys have indicated a strong desire for big cat evidence to be researched as robustly as possible, and for all aspects of this subject to be considered in a responsible way," added Mr Minter.
"We are coming to a time when we must learn about them."

article The US economy added 235,000 new jobs in February, Mr Trump's first full month in office.
He retweeted a news report with the caption: "GREAT AGAIN".
During a campaign speech last August, Mr Trump called the Department of Labor numbers one of the "biggest hoaxes in American modern politics".
Challenged about this contradiction at Friday's daily news briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Mr Trump believes, "they may have been phony in the past but it's very real now."
The latest figures brought down the US unemployment rate from 4.8% to 4.7%, the report found.
Much of the growth is being attributed by analysts to an unusually clement few weeks, allowing construction projects and hiring to continue uninterrupted.
Last month was the warmest February on record.
Two years ago in a press conference, Mr Trump attacked the official unemployment rate, calling it "such a phony number" and "the biggest joke".
He asserted that some "great economists" estimate the real US jobless rate is as high as 32% or 42%.
PolitiFact, a fact-checking website, rated this claim as "pants on fire" false.
Mr Trump's US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during his confirmation hearing that "the unemployment rate is not real".

article Her call came the day after it was announced Scotland would face a £176.8m cut in public spending this year.
Chancellor George Osborne announced a £3bn cut in UK departmental budgets for 2015/16 and the knock-on for Scotland.
In a letter to the four opposition leaders, Ms Sturgeon said the parties "must speak with a united voice".
The letter was sent to Labour's Kezia Dugdale, Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Willie Rennie of the Lib Dems and Scottish Green Patrick Harvie.
It said: "I hope that you will agree with me that all parties in Scotland must unite in making clear to the UK government that it is unacceptable for reductions to be imposed on this year's Scottish Budget.
"Not only do such reductions have a potentially damaging impact on our programmes and public services, but the chancellor's approach shows little respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament itself in approving the annual devolved Scottish Budget."
Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government would continue to argue for an alternative to the UK government's austerity programme.
This would involve a "moderate increase" in public spending of 0.5% a year in real terms between 2016-17 and 2019-20, she said.
Mr Osborne made his cuts announcement ahead of his emergency budget, which will take place on 8 July.
The Tory chancellor said he believed it was vital to tackle UK debt "as quickly as possible".
The UK government has pledged to clear the deficit by 2018/19.
Mr Osborne must find a further £30bn of savings over the next three years, including £12bn from welfare spending and £13bn from government departments.
Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: "Nicola Sturgeon doesn't seem to understand that if Britain is going to prosper for the long-term, it needs to pay its way in the world and no longer pass on multi-billion pound deficits for our children and grand-children to pay off."
He added: "The truth is that the time when the SNP could resort to its age-old tactic of whipping up grievance over UK government decisions is over.
"Tax-raising powers are coming to the Scottish Parliament, so if it wants to act, it can."
Mr Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said he opposed the UK government cuts but "the Tories are unlikely to listen".
He said: "The real challenge will be to achieve unity in the Scottish Parliament to use our own devolved power to achieve fairer taxation and protection of the public services we all depend on."

article Mr Mladic faces 11 charges, including genocide and crimes against humanity, dating to the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
He is specifically accused of a hand in the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosniak men and boys at Srebrenica - Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
Mr Mladic denies all charges and has denounced the UN tribunal as "satanic".
At the session on Tuesday, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that there were still good grounds to try Mr Mladic on two counts of genocide.
The charges relate to the killings at Srebrenica, and to the expulsion of the Muslim Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats and other non-Serb populations in a wartime campaign that came to be known as "ethnic cleansing".
Lawyers for Mr Mladic had argued that there was not enough evidence linking him to the most serious of the crimes.
However, Judge Alphons Orie said "that the accused has a case to answer on all counts", citing material presented by prosecutors, including video footage of Mr Mladic calling on revenge against the Muslims of Srebrenica.
Mr Mladic is also charged in connection with the 44-month siege of Sarajevo during which more than 10,000 people died.

article Carwyn Jones thinks the lesson is that the party must show it is distinctly Welsh.
Voters aren't interested if they suspect someone in London is pulling the strings, he says.
"We suffered in 1999 because we were seen as a party being controlled by London and we have to accept that. That's not the case any more."
Between now and polling day on May 5 he'll be doing his best to convince you that Labour has learned that lesson over the last 17 years.
Labour wants its campaign to have a distinctly Welsh flavour. That's why its Welsh leader will be front and centre throughout.
He wants another five years in power to complete a "decade of delivery" that started in 2011.
But opponents say he's had long enough to deliver. He's been first minister since 2009. Labour has led the Welsh government since 1999.
On a campaigning visit to a day care nursery in Cardiff, he brushes aside that criticism.
"I think we've delivered a huge amount for people," he says.
He cites "ground breaking laws" on organ donation and Aston Martin's recently announced plans to build luxury cars in south Wales.
Were it not for devolution, "we would have a junior doctors' strike".
But the opposition parties see it differently. Were it not for Welsh Labour's devolved government, we'd have shorter waiting times in the NHS, according to the Conservatives.
Labour's record in the health service will be the big battle ground in the election - an election Mr Jones says is "a straight fight" with the Tories.
He says UKIP pose a threat to Labour too, but in our interview - as in his Welsh Labour conference speech last month - he doesn't mention Plaid Cymru at all.
It's a reflection of Labour's strategy to convince voters this is an either/or election: either keep Carwyn Jones as first minister, or hand over the reins to Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader.
But could that strategy be undone by the spectacle of Labour MPs feuding with each other in Westminster since Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader after last year's general election defeat?
"What we've seen in London hasn't helped. Nobody could pretend otherwise," he says.
"It's calmer there now but people don't like parties which are fighting with each other."
He adds: "What we've said to people is as Welsh Labour we're united. We've got a programme going into the election. I'm the leader.
"And the policies that we will develop in Wales, the policies we will put in our manifesto, are all crafted in Wales.
There's no influence over those policies in terms of our colleagues in London. They wouldn't seek to influence our policies anyway."
Mr Jones likes to call his Welsh government a "pro-business government".
I ask him whether that's his coded way of distancing his administration in Cardiff from the left-wing politics of Mr Corbyn and his supporters.
"No. This is my way of differentiating Welsh Labour as a party. I would do this regardless of what the situation was in London," he says.
"We've done it in elections past. People in Wales want to support parties that they feel have a degree of autonomy, enough of a degree of autonomy, that makes them a properly Welsh party with roots in Wales."
He denies that his "decade of delivery" is a hint that, if he wins, he's planning to stand down at 2021 election.
He and wife Lisa have a son Ruairi and daughter Seren, both of whom are at school. Does he ever wonder about life away politics - a life where he could spend more time with them?
"The honest answer is yes, it has been difficult for the family. My children have only know me as a minister and you do make sacrifices in this job.
"When I get spare time I do spend time with the family. It means you've not got much time for anything else."
But he adds: "I love the job. It's for other people to decide whether I stay in it obviously. You couldn't do this job if you didn't like it."
Those other people - the voters - will make their decision on May 5.

article New figures show there were 14,670 households accepted as homeless between July and September, the largest number since 2008.
According to Shelter, more than 103,000 children will spend Christmas in B&Bs, hostels or temporary rented homes.
Ministers said the figures were still half the 2003 and 2004 peak.
Department for Communities and Local Government statistics show there were 68,560 families in temporary housing from July to September this year, compared with 60,900 in the same three months of 2014.
And 53,480 of those were households with children, compared with 45,590 at the same time the year before.
Shelter said a quarter of all homeless households living in temporary accommodation in England had been moved away to another council area.
The figures showed 18,600 homeless households moved to another area, more than three times as many as in 2010.
Families in temporary accommodation outside their local areas are under particular strain, according to Shelter.
They are "uprooted and moved away from jobs, schools and support networks with no idea when, or even if, they will be able to return", says chief executive Campbell Robb.
But four in ten homeless households in temporary accommodation find themselves in this position, the latest figures show.
This is more than three times the figure for the same period in 2010 when 5,880 households were in temporary accommodation in another local authority area.
Families in bed and breakfast hotels who have to share kitchens and bathrooms often rely on kitchen facilities of relatives or friends to cook healthy food, a Shelter researcher explained.
One woman, offered temporary accommodation in a city hundreds of miles from home, turned it down as she would have lost her job and her children would have been forced to change schools.
Frequent changes of school and long journeys can be very disrupting for children, the researcher added.
Councils are finding it far harder to find homeless households local accommodation due to "a severe drought of affordable homes and drastic cuts to council budgets", Mr Robb added.
The problem is particularly acute in London where one in three families in temporary accommodation are outside their original areas.
Communities Minister Marcus Jones said: "We are committed to helping the most vulnerable people in our society. The protection of the Homelessness Prevention Grant in the Local Government Finance Settlement shows our continued commitment to tackling homelessness.
"Statutory homelessness acceptances are now less than half the 2003 to 2004 peak but we are determined to ensure that anybody who needs help gets it.
"We have made over £500m available since 2010, which has prevented nearly a million people becoming homeless. We are committed to build on this over the next four years and work with the sector to do all we can to prevent homelessness."
New measures include protecting homelessness prevention for local authorities and £40m from the Department of Health to refurbish hostels and provide low cost shared accommodation for young people. There will also be £30m extra for councils' homelessness budgets and a £5m fund for the 25 local authorities facing the greatest pressures moving people from temporary to settled homes.
The councils sharing the funding are: Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Birmingham, Brent, Bromley, Brighton and Hove, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hackney, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Hounslow , Islington, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Lewisham, Luton, Newham, Redbridge, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Wandsworth and Westminster
Shelter said the figures meant 109,000 children in England, Scotland and Wales would be in a hostel or temporary accommodation on 25 December, 103,430 of them in England.
Chief executive of Shelter, Campbell Robb, said:  "These figures are a heart-breaking reminder that thousands of families will wake up homeless this Christmas morning - many hidden away in a cramped and dingy B&B or hostel room, sometimes miles away from everyone and everything they know.
"With the double blow of cuts to welfare and a chronic lack of affordable housing, many more families are facing a desperate battle to keep a roof over their heads.
"Our advisors will be working non-stop to support the 109,000 children who'll be homeless this Christmas, but we're struggling to keep up with demand. That's why we urgently need more support from the public to help us make sure that no-one is left to fight bad housing or homelessness on their own."
A spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils finding it difficult to house homeless people because of a shortage of affordable homes and funding pressures.
He added: "It is important that councils have the funding and flexibilities to help those who find themselves homeless or at risk of homelessness. Local authorities also need the power to invest in building more homes that local communities can genuinely afford."
A person is considered "statutorily homeless" by the government if they no longer have a legal right to occupy their accommodation or if it would no longer be reasonable to live there, for example if it would lead to violence against them.
Other reasons included no longer being able to stay with family or friends, relationship breakdown and mortgage arrears leading to repossession.
summary Shelter has warned that the number of children sleeping rough in the UK is on the rise.

article Eric Laurent and Catherine Graciet, who are writing a book on King Mohammed VI, were reportedly detained after being handed cash by a Moroccan official.
A lawyer for the Moroccan government told France's RTL radio that Mr Laurent contacted the royal palace in July to demand â‚¬3 million (Â£2.2m; $3.4m).
Mr Laurent allegedly warned the palace about damaging revelations in the book.
"A sum of money was handed over and accepted" at a meeting between the journalist and a Moroccan government official, according to France's AFP news agency.
The publishing company Editions du Seuil confirmed that the pair, who have already written one book about the Moroccan monarch, were working on a second volume due for publication early next year.
Moroccan website Le360.ma, which has close ties to the palace, reported details of how Moroccan representatives held two meetings with Mr Laurent that were monitored by police.
The journalists were then arrested after leaving a restaurant with an alleged down payment, the report said.
Mr Laurent and Ms Graciet's 2012 book, Predator King, was critical of Mohammed VI, detailing how his fortune had ballooned since taking the throne in 1999.
Moroccan law prohibits criticising the king, with a possible penalty of up to five years in prison for anyone who does so.

article Graciam Kondowe was among 54 passengers who police say survived after the boat overturned in stormy weather on Sunday.
Five people drowned while 11 are still missing, police said.
The boat was packed with worshippers returning from Easter celebrations when it capsized in the remote Rumphi district in northern Malawi.
Mr Kondowe told Malawi's privately owned Zodiac radio station that heavy winds buffeted the boat about 15 minutes into their journey.
The crew decided to return to shore, but the boat capsized before they could get back, he added.
Mr Kondowe said he held on to a bag of maize flour which fell out of the boat, and eventually swam his way to safety.
Eight of the 54 survivors are being treated in hospital after sustaining injuries, police officer Denis Banda said.
Locals residents used canoes to rescue most of the passengers, Malawian journalist Joab Chakhaza told the BBC.
Search operations are continuing for the 11 people still missing, but the chances of finding them alive are slim, he adds.
Boats are a common mode of transport on the vast Lake Malawi, and accidents of this magnitude are rare.
In 2012, 47 migrants fleeing drought and conflict in Somalia and Ethiopia drowned in the lake after their boat capsized.

article Zhang Chunxian vowed to use "iron fists" on separatists in the region, Xinhua news agency says.
The warning comes on the anniversary of deadly ethnic riots that saw almost 200 people killed in 2009.
Rights group Amnesty International has accused China of intimidating the ethnic Uighur minority.
Xinjiang province is the country's most westerly region and borders former Soviet states.
China witnessed its worst ethnic violence in decades when riots erupted between the majority Han Chinese and the minority Uighurs in the capital city of Urumqi, says the BBC's Martin Patience.
The Turkic-speaking Uighurs, who have lived in China's shadow for centuries, accuse Beijing of religious and political persecution.
Mr Zhang, who is Communist Party secretary of the Xinjiang committee, urged soldiers to remain vigilant against hostile forces and strike separatists, terrorists and extremists with ''iron fists'', Xinhua says.
"We should leave terrorists no place to hide," he said, adding that the region was stable but faced "severe challenges".
London-based rights group Amnesty International (AI) issued a statement saying that Chinese authorities "continue to silence those speaking out on abuses" in the region.
"The general trend toward repression that we see all over China is particularly pronounced in Xinjiang," Catherine Baber, AI Asia-Pacific director,  
          said in a statement
.
She urged the Chinese government to reveal the whereabouts of those who have disappeared and end the persecution of family members seeking answers.
On Monday, there were reports that two Uighur men who allegedly tried to hijack a plane in Xinjiang had died.

Stokes was hit for four consecutive sixes in the last over by Carlos Brathwaite as the West Indies beat England in a dramatic final on Sunday.
"He is an outstanding talent and an outstanding cricketer," said Cook.
"He is the type of character who will deal with it, and he will still be the Ben Stokes who can score 250 in a Test match," added the 31-year-old opener.
"It was outstanding hitting. 'Stokesy' would certainly have his first ball again but the second one wasn't too far off the mark and it went 94 metres back."
Cook admitted he was devastated by England's defeat, telling BBC Essex: "I don't normally get too emotional watching a game of cricket.
"It was a brilliant tournament for everyone, it's just a shame that last over didn't quite go to plan."
Cook's county, Essex, begin a new era under newly-appointed coach Chris Silverwood on Sunday against Gloucestershire.
The left-hander, England's leading run-scorer in Test cricket, is available to play in the Division Two opener at Chelmsford.
"In any elite sport you do need freshening up at certain times," Cook said. "I think it was fairly obvious after seven or eight years it was time for a change.
"We've been the nearly men for the last four or five years. We've been close to promotion a number of times.
"Everyone is excited about the beginning of the season. Every county will be thinking they've got the chance to have a good year."

article The report from David Strang, chief inspector of prisons for Scotland, made 41 recommendations to improve performance at the jail.
However he said the report was "good" overall, with positive points raised about food, visiting arrangements and staff-prisoner relationships.
The jail was inspected in December.
The prison, Scotland's oldest, was built in 1810 by Napoleonic prisoners of war and has an agreed capacity of 631. At the time of inspection, there were a total of 626 prisoners held there.
The jail has previously been criticised for overcrowding.
Mr Strang said the standard of accommodation at the prison was "reasonable", but noted: "Some cells are designed as single cell accommodation were regularly occupied by two people, and were extremely cramped with insufficient room to move around in."
He also reported that while prisoners have "good access to a varied regime" including work, education and recreation, "work party spaces are insufficient, which results in some prisoners spending longer periods of time within their cells".
Between 1 January and 30 November there were 94 recorded violent incidents in the prison, including nine attacks on staff, 48 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, and 37 fights between prisoners. The prison authorities responded to this by introducing a revised violence reduction strategy.
Mr Strang concluded that "overall this is a good report for HMP Perth", and said the inspectorate would continue to monitor progress made in relation to the 41 recommendations.

article Apple won a ban on the devices, claiming Samsung had copied its iPhone and iPad.
South Korean Samsung had been unable to sell products in Australia since July.
The two companies are engaged in legal battles in more than 10 countries since April accusing each other of infringing smartphone and tablet patents.
Last month, Samsung won an appeal against a temporary ban on sales.
However, Apple was awarded a stay of the orders. On Friday Apple's bid to extend the ban was turned down by the High Court.
The ruling is a rare win for Samsung as it allows the company to sell its Galaxy Tab 10.1 in time for the busy Christmas shopping season, a lucrative time for the industry.
The decision comes after a US court ruled against Apple's bid to ban Galaxy phones and tablets, another win for Samsung. Apple has appealed against that ruling.
However, the legal tussle in other markets is not going as well for Samsung.
The company said on Friday that a French court had turned down its request to ban sale of the latest iPhone in that country.

article The principality's vast harbour is littered with huge yachts belonging to those rich people who are not only proud of the trappings of their station in life, but are always looking for different ways to display it.
One story I heard was of a super yacht owner who had just found a new use for his vessel - the school run.
But for some, a mega yacht on its own is no longer enough - you need the latest accessories too. Amongst the newest of these is a machine whose time, advocates say, has come - the "personal" submarine.
Several of the latest models were on display in Monaco, including some from a small US company - DeepFlight.
It was founded by the British engineer, inventor and entrepreneur Graham Hawkes, who has had an extraordinary career.
For many years he held a world record for solo depth diving; he's invented a robotic machine-gun; and he's played the part of a villain in a James Bond film. He designed and operated a small sub used in an underwater battle in the movie, For Your Eyes Only.
BBC presenter Peter Day and I first met Mr Hawkes in California several years ago. At the time he was obsessed with the idea of building a craft capable of going right to the bottom of the ocean.
Beaten to it by film director James Cameron, who accomplished the feat in 2012, he steered his business in a new direction.
Now, his company makes a range of submersible craft aimed at the super yacht crowd, marine researchers, and others.
One of the selling points of machines like these, says Mr Hawkes, is that they enable astonishing experiences.
Once, when he was taking the entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson on an underwater trip, they had a memorable encounter with a great white shark, which swam past them.
"It was bigger than this submersible", he recalls. "I was looking straight in to this eye of this huge predator and I was just in awe. And Richard was saying 'Graham, get closer, get closer'.
"And all I remember saying is 'Richard, I'm not going to lunge at a great white shark'. But we ended up laughing and giggling after that, we were so happy."
The devices made by DeepFlight differ from some other small subs because they are "positively buoyant," and need force or motion to keep them underwater.
If thrust disappears for any reason, the craft will float back to the surface - a feature which Mr Hawkes claims offers safety benefits.
The Super Falcon model works in a similar way to an aircraft, he explains: "It has 'wings' and you need to get some speed, about a walking speed on the surface, and then you point it down and the wings pull it down… and it flies under water. "
Another model, the Dragon, works more like a helicopter, and can "hover" underwater.
Small submarines have been around for many years but it is only comparatively recently that the market for them has begun to take off.
"My partner and I were at yacht shows twenty years ago with manned submersibles and bigger diesel electric luxury submarines," recalls another Monaco exhibitor, L. Bruce Jones of Florida-based Triton Submarines.
"And people would walk by our booth and sort of snicker at us - what are those crazy guys doing here?
"But now, fast forward twenty years and we're being accepted."
One reason for this change lies in recent advances in technology, which have helped to lower manufacturing costs, and also enabled the production of more versatile craft, with many additional features.
Triton's range includes battery-powered subs that can dive down to depths of hundreds of metres for many hours before needing to return to the surface.
Another development, that is proving popular with customers, is the huge increase in the size of windows.
"In the old days you used to have this big steel pressure hull with small windows," says Erik Hasselman of Dutch sub makers U-Boat Worx, which is also exhibiting its products at the Monaco show.
Mr Hasselman says that recent improvements in acrylic technology mean that "we can build these very large acrylic spheres that will allow people to have a really big window," and thus get a much better view of what is happening beneath the waves.
None of this comes cheap. Prices for the smallest personal submersible craft start at around $1.5m (£1m). The high cost is likely to ensure that these products remain the preserve of the wealthy, commercial users, and well-funded research bodies.
However sub-makers also see the possibility of substantial growth in the leisure market, in which operators are already offering tourists underwater trips in small submarines.
If that happens, then increasing attention may start to be focused on the health of the world's oceans - something that many scientists are deeply concerned about.
At the moment, says Mr Hawkes, this issue can seem remote to many people.
But, he asks, "what if the politician …what if the fisherman, what if the housewife who was worried about the damage to the ocean could have gone and seen? … The important thing is that, [today] nobody can go, nobody can see.
"We're trying to change that."
summary Monaco is a place where the rich and famous can relax and enjoy the luxury of life.
