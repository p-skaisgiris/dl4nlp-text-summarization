We were focused absolutely on those assembly elections.\"\\nShe added: \"I think it was a mistake not to be talking about the European referendum in those assembly elections.\"\\nWales voted 52.5% to 47.5% for Brexit. Only five counting areas voted to Remain.\\nThe strongest Leave votes were in Torfaen (60%) and Blaenau Gwent (62%) - two traditional Labour strongholds in the south Wales valleys.\\nThe Welsh government has a programme to \"re-energise\" communities that voted to Leave, much of which would have been funded by EU money, Baroness Morgan said.\\n\"The question for us now is how on Earth do we reorganise the economy without that European funding?\" she asked.\\n\"Unless we find a way to reconnect with that working class element within our communities then I think the Labour party is in a serious situation in future\".\\nLabour won 29 seats at May\\'s assembly election - a better result than many expected - but lost 7.6% of its share of the vote on the constituency ballot.\\nEarlier, on BBC Sunday Politics Wales, Baroness Morgan said Carwyn Jones was \"absolutely, without question\" the right man to lead Welsh Labour.', \"Trouble is, the aspen tree itself doesn't like to produce seeds which makes life very difficult for everyone.\\nBut last year I visited Shropshire company Forestart and helped them out with their plans to get their aspens in a seed producing mood.\\nForestart harvests a billion wild tree seeds every year to grow into new trees for planting.\\nYou can read a blogpost about their plans here, but here's the general gist.\\nAspen trees usually reproduce by sending up suckers, thin plants that are clones of the parent tree.\\nThat's no good for Forestart who need seeds to grow new aspens.\\nThe last time aspens in Scotland flowered and produced seeds was twenty years ago.\\nSo Robert Lee from Forestart had a plan. I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins. It's something that you very rarely see in nature.\\nRobert explained to me I'd missed the very best display and a windy day had rather done for the flowers on the male trees but overall it was a remarkable thing to see.\\nIt's also really good news for Robert as if all goes to plan he and his team will be able to gather a huge volume of aspen seeds later in the year.\\nCan we be sure it was our intervention that made the difference?\\nWell yes, as Robert cut the bark so that some trees had branches below the exposed part of the tree.\\nThose branches had no flowers, no catkins, while the rest of the tree was laden.\\nIt's not totally clear why this worked, it could be the stress as Robert first though or it might be the ring of removed bark blocks the goodness in the aspen leaves from returning to the roots and instead keeps it all in the tree canopy which in turn leads to an eruption of flowers.\\nThe trees themselves are healing nicely and while this won't be an annual event it is something Forestart could repeat in the future.\\nMeaning more chances for people who want to plant this most wonderful of our native trees.\\nThe only slight cloud on the horizon is if the whole effort is too successful, we get a lot of seeds and the local bird population treat the aspen seeds as a very expensive lunch.\\nFingers crossed the siskins find something else to eat instead!\", 'The hyperbaric chamber, which treats divers with \"the bends\", was operated by St John\\'s Ambulance on a donation basis until it broke in April 2014.\\nThe health department replaced it in 2015, but says it needs to \"balance the books\".\\nDiving instructor Steve Bougourd said he was \"gobsmacked\".\\n\"I\\'m just worried that this kind of cost will put people off of actually going to the [hospital] and notifying them if they suspect a problem,\" he said.\\n\"We may find it\\'s going to be very expensive to get out divers insured.\"\\nIn the UK hyperbaric oxygen treatment is covered by the NHS, but Guernsey has its own health care system.\\nSource: NHS\\nAssistant director at Guernsey\\'s health and social care department (HSC) Ed Freestone said renting the chamber was costing the government £60,000 a year.\\nHe said the department would not make a profit from the new charges, which were based on \"the average usage that we could identify over the previous few years\".\\nIn addition to paying for the training of staff and the maintenance of a 24 hour service, the department had to fund plans to buy its own chamber for about £250,000, Mr Freestone said.\\nCommercial divers already pay a £150 notification fee to dive which raises about £10,000 a year, according to HSC.\\nIt is a legal requirement to provide a hyperbaric chamber facility for commercial diving activity to take place within Guernsey\\'s 12-mile limit.', 'The ex-Reading defender denied fraudulent trading charges relating to the Sodje Sports Foundation - a charity to raise money for Nigerian sport.\\nMr Sodje, 37, is jointly charged with elder brothers Efe, 44, Bright, 50 and Stephen, 42.\\nAppearing at the Old Bailey earlier, all four denied the offence.\\nThe charge relates to offences which allegedly took place between 2008 and 2014.\\nSam, from Kent, Efe and Bright, of Greater Manchester, and Stephen, from Bexley, are due to stand trial in July.\\nThey were all released on bail.', 'No firms in Northern Ireland have so far been affected by the ransomware attack, which wreaked havoc on organisations including the National Health Service in England and Scotland.\\nThe virus could have spread even further had a cyber security researcher not accidently discovered a \"kill switch\" in the malicious program.\\nHe was assisted by a researcher from security firm Proofpoint, which has an office in Belfast.\\nThere is no shortage of cyber security experts in Northern Ireland - the industry now employs about 1,200 people.\\nAnd there is such a demand for their expertise, they can earn twice the average salary in Northern Ireland.\\nInvest NI - the region\\'s business development agency - says Northern Ireland is the number one location in the world for cyber security inward investment and the number one global destination for US cyber security companies with an eye for international expansion.\\nInvest NI said companies had been enticed by the \"hard-to-find\" skillsets being nurtured at Queen\\'s and Ulster University.\\n\"Companies such as Black Duck, Rapid 7, Proofpoint, Alert Logic and Whitehat are recent investors here,\" said a spokeswoman.\\n\"And with Symantec, a security software vendor, predicting the number of job openings to rise to 6m globally by 2019, there are real opportunities for our talented workforce.\"\\nEmily McDaid writes about all things tech and edits the Techwatch blog for Catalyst Inc Connect, a not-for-profit network that runs a number of programmes to help innovation companies get off the ground or grow.\\nNorthern Ireland has a booming tech sector, she said, particularly in the fields of cyber security, data analytics, fintech (software for the financial sector) and blockchain - the technology underpinning the digital currency Bitcoin.\\n\"London is no longer the go-to place,\" she said. \"Northern Ireland is a cheaper place to live and do business. And if the corporation tax was to be lowered, that would be massive for the sector.\"\\nCyber security has become big business for corporate firms and start-ups in Northern Ireland, she said, and they are in the unique position of working in both the Irish and UK markets.\\nShe has written about a start-up in Belfast, one of only two companies in the world, which uses a person\\'s heartbeat as a way of identification, as opposed to fingerprints or retinal scan.\\nThen there are the two female cryptography experts looking at how to keep data safe when quantum computing becomes a reality - quantum computers will be so clever they will be able to break security algorithms easily, and hack data in seconds.\\nIn addition to working with at least 500 entrepreneurs each year, Mrs McDaid\\'s organisation inspires young people to pursue careers in tech and innovation.\\n\"Cyber security is so big at the moment, it has an 0% unemployment rate,\" added Mrs McDaid.\\n\"The more NI becomes a recognised centre of innovation, the more you will get the talent coming up through the generations.\"\\nLast week, two international conferences were held in Belfast on the issue of cyber security - it is a burgeoning industry because with every technological advance comes a new opportunity for criminals to exploit it.\\nOne of the conferences was hosted by the Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), based at the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast\\'s Titanic Quarter.\\nCSIT, which is part of Queen\\'s University Belfast, is home to the UK\\'s largest cyber-security research cluster.\\nDavid Crozier, head of strategic partnerships and engagement at the major research hub, says it has a \"critical mass of researchers\" looking at malware, network security, encryption and critical infrastructure.\\nHe said the centre had acted as a magnet for companies, attracted by the research and skilled workforce.\\nWhile it is a global export-based business, with most firms working for multi-nationals, the industry is a significant contributor to the economy, says Mr Crozier.\\n\"The skills are so in demand at the moment that the industry is on course to generate salaries of £60m per annum,\" he said.\\n\"For those citizens with the knowledge, they are able to earn about £42,500 per year - the average salary here is about £23,000.\"\\nNorthern Ireland as a whole also wins because it means some of the world\\'s foremost cyber-security experts are living here.\\n\"Citizens not working in the industry will benefit from the expertise and all the work that is going on to ensure government and public service systems are resilient and secure,\" said Mr Crozier.\\n\"They can never be 100% secure and breaches are a daily occurrence, even for big companies, but more often than not, networks will be protected.\"\\nMr Crozier is part of a working group, which includes the police and various government departments.\\nSince last year, it has been operating as the NI Cyber Security Framework for Action and its aim is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to cyber security.\\nThe group has formulated a set of priorities and while the political deadlock at Stormont means they are still unpublished, Mr Crozier says the work is certainly not on hold.\\n\"The man on the street doesn\\'t want to think about cyber security,\" he added.\\n\"But the public needs to know there are people working behind the scenes to protect networks and keep ahead of attackers.\\n\"They are unsung heroes and they only come to prominence when a major event happens.\"', 'Scotland\\'s National Action Plan for Human Rights has been developed after four years of research by the Scottish Human Rights Commission.\\nThe plan aims to improve human rights protection in Scotland.\\nThe commission\\'s evidence suggests basic rights are not consistently promoted, respected or protected in people\\'s every day lives.\\nThe Scottish government, the NHS, Amnesty International and various other organisations including trade unions and local authorities were involved in creating the action plan.\\nAreas of concern when drawing up the document included: care, disability rights, health, criminal justice and business.\\nCommitments have been made by the bodies behind the plan to integrate human rights more closely into their work.\\nCommission chair Professor Alan Miller said: \"Today, International Human Rights Day, Scotland is taking a big step towards building a country where everyone can live a life of human dignity.\\n\"The Scottish Parliament has human rights at its heart, it created the Scottish Human Rights Commission and today Scotland\\'s first National Action Plan for Human Rights is launched as the next step on Scotland\\'s journey to progressively realise internationally agreed human rights for the benefit of everyone.\"\\nAlthough this is the first human rights action plan in the UK, they do exist in other countries, such as Sweden, Spain, New Zealand and Australia.\\nNils Muiznieks, the Council of Europe\\'s Commissioner for Human Rights said: \"Scotland\\'s National Action Plan for Human Rights is a bold venture which aims to bring human rights home in people\\'s everyday life.\\n\"It signals a strong commitment to internationally agreed human rights standards which is particularly significant in the current context of economic crisis and austerity.\"\\nDeputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: \"The plan is an important milestone in our journey to create a Scotland which acts as a beacon of progress internationally.\\n\"We will continue to work with the Scottish Human Rights Commission to make rights a reality for all in Scotland, in keeping with the importance this Government has long attached to human dignity, equality and fairness and the pursuit of social justice.\"', 'The hoard, which includes silver pennies dating back to the 10th and 11th centuries, was discovered by Walter Hanks in Llandwrog in March.\\nNational Museum Wales said some of the coins were made under the ruler Sihtric Anlafsson and were a type rarely found on the British mainland.\\nIt said they were likely to have been hidden or lost between 1020 and 1030.\\nDr Mark Redknap, of the department of history and archaeology at National Museum Wales, said the mixed nature of the collection showed bullion played an active role in the 11th Century economy and gave an idea of the wealth of Gwynedd at the time.\\nThe museum now hopes to buy the coins and put them on display.', 'At Turf Moor on Saturday, Burnley and West Brom played out a game in which the ball was in play for only 160 seconds more than it was out.\\nThough these are early days, no Premier League match so far this season has seen less action.\\nTwo months ago, football\\'s lawmakers revealed they were considering scrapping 45-minute halves, instead introducing two periods of 30 minutes, during which the clock would be stopped every time the ball went out.\\nThe proposal, the International Football Association Board said, was one of a number of options to deter football\\'s \"negativities\".\\nSo would the rule have benefited supporters at Premier League matches so far this season? In a word, yes.\\nOf 19 top-flight games across the opening two weekends of the campaign, the ball has been in play for more than an hour in only two of them.\\nAnd no game has featured more than 61 minutes of play.\\nFood for thought for fans and lawmakers alike.\\nHere\\'s the rest of the key Premier League statistics from the weekend.\\nIt was a landmark weekend for Wayne Rooney as he joined Alan Shearer in the 200 Premier League goals club with his strike against Manchester City on Monday.\\nHere\\'s how and when he has scored them.\\nRooney has some way to go to beat former Newcastle and Blackburn striker Shearer\\'s record of 260 goals, although his goal at Etihad Stadium was his fifth in his past eight Premier League games.\\nIf he can keep that up then who knows...\\n... try, try again?\\nWell doing just that doesn\\'t appear to be yielding results in the Premier League so far this season.\\nHarry Kane must have some sort of pox on him that prevents him from scoring in August, and it\\'s hard not to sympathise as everything conspired to deny him a goal against Chelsea on Sunday.\\nHe\\'s attempted 14 shots so far this term - no player has managed more - all without reward.\\n\"Obviously my decision not to read the British press was one of the best I ever made in my life.\"\\nJudging by the above quote, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was perhaps getting a little tired of the criticism of his side\\'s defending before they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday.\\nIt was a welcome clean sheet after the Reds conceded three in their Premier League opener against Watford and then let in a late goal in the midweek 2-1 Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim. But is their defence really a problem?\\nOn the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.\\nA concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).\\nHowever, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German\\'s first at Anfield, while Saturday\\'s result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\\nThe run of four clean sheets in Liverpool\\'s final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.\\nPossession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.\\nThe Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger\\'s side \\'enjoyed\\' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.\\nIt was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.\\nClearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley\\'s books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.\\nJavier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.\\nThe former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.\\nIn fact, not one of Hernandez\\'s 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England\\'s top flight.\\nHernandez\\'s failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.\\nAgainst Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you\\'ve guessed it, went wide.\\nThe fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.\\nLife just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.\\nThe Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.\\nIt means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated. A sign that the season is a marathon and not a sprint.\\nBut perhaps youthful exuberance will see David Wagner\\'s men continue to upset the odds. Huddersfield have named two of the four youngest starting XIs in the Premier League so far this season - and average age of 25 years and 143 days at Crystal Palace and 25 years 331 days against Newcastle.', 'The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull\\'s Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one.\\nMercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem.\\nThey broke a rule saying: \"The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.\"\\nMercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision.\\nThe Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track.\\nTeams are allowed to intervene if the car has a \"critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal\".\\nRace stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem.\\nBut they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear.\\nRosberg\\'s engineer Tony Ross replied to the German\\'s information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: \"Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.\"\\nRosberg then asked: \"What does that mean, I have to shift through it?\\nEngineer: \"Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.\"\\nBoth Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance.\\nHorner said: \"The rule is rubbish. It doesn\\'t make a great deal of sense.

Large numbers are exported to Hong Kong, where they are consumed or further exported to mainland China.\\n\"On the issue of shark\\'s fin, with immediate effect we are happy to agree to ban the carriage,\" Cathay Pacific said in a statement on Wednesday.\\nIt said it had not approved any shark fin shipments over the last year, pointing out that it had turned down 15 shipment requests for shark-related products.\\nEarly reports said the ban extended to all shark products on cargo and passenger flights, but the airline told the BBC it currently applied to shark fin only,\\nCathay said it would continue to review its policy.\\nMarine conservationists hailed Cathay\\'s decision, with one proclaiming that it would make Hong Kong \"proud\".\\n\"More Hong Kong businesses need to follow the lead,\" Hong Kong-based conservationist Sharon Kwok told AFP.\\nGovernment data cited by the South China Morning Post shows that shark fin imports to Hong Kong dropped by 42% between 2010 and 2015 to 5,717 tonnes.\\nDuring this period there was also a significant decline in imports by air.\\nCathay now joins airlines including British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Emirates in banning shark fin.', 'They describe it as a kind of \"jet stream\" - a fast-flowing river of liquid iron that is surging westwards under Alaska and Siberia.\\nThe moving mass of metal has been inferred from measurements made by Europe’s Swarm satellites.\\nThis trio of spacecraft are currently mapping Earth\\'s magnetic field to try to understand its fundamental workings.\\nThe scientists say the jet is the best explanation for the patches of concentrated field strength that the satellites observe in the northern hemisphere.\\n\"This jet of liquid iron is moving at about fifty kilometres per year,\" explained Dr Chris Finlay from the National Space Institute at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Space).\\n“That might not sound like a lot to you on Earth\\'s surface, but you have to remember this a very dense liquid metal and it takes a huge amount of energy to move this thing around and that\\'s probably the fastest motion we have anywhere within the solid Earth,” he told BBC News.\\nDr Finlay was speaking here at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in San Francisco, just ahead of the official publication of the research in the journal Nature Geoscience.\\nMost people will be familiar with the atmospheric jet stream - the high-altitude, rapidly flowing belt of air on which aeroplanes ride to get to their destination more quickly.\\nDr Finlay and colleagues want us to envision something similar but made of metal and 3,000km down, under our feet.\\nThey assess the jet to be about 420km wide, and say it wraps half-way around the planet.\\nIts behaviour will be critical to the generation and maintenance of the global magnetic field, they add.\\n“It\\'s likely that the jet stream has been in play for hundreds of millions of years,\" said Dr Phil Livermore from Leeds University, UK, and the lead author on the journal paper.\\nIn the paper, the team puts forward a model to explain the jet.\\nThe scientists say the feature probably aligns to a boundary between two different regions in the core.\\nThey call this boundary the \"tangent cylinder\". They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis.\\nWhen liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.\\n\"Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,\" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.\\n\"This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.\"\\nAlthough the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.\\nDr Livermore told BBC News: \"It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).\"\\nThat the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.\\nLaunched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth\\'s magnetic field.\\nWith their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field\\'s various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.\\nIt is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.\\nScientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.\\nThis occurs every few hundred thousand years.\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos', 'The trailer concludes with a shot of Vader and the sound of his trademark heavy breathing.\\nFelicity Jones stars in Gareth Edwards\\' film as the leader of a Rebel mission to steal the plans for the Death Star.\\nThe film is set before the time of the first Star Wars film A New Hope, released in 1977, and does not form part of the main series.\\nThe two-minute promo, which is different from the one shown at last month\\'s Star Wars Celebration event in London, begins with new character Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) telling Jyn Erso (Jones) that \"the world is coming undone\".\\n\"Imperial flags reign across the galaxy,\" his voice continues over a shot of an Empire vessel floating above a desert landscape.\\nThe trailer goes on to show Jyn and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) being told about the mission for which they have been selected.\\nSubsequent scenes feature a new robot character voiced by Alan Tudyk, a blind warrior played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, and an Imperial Walker being struck by a missile.\\nActress Alyssa Milano, screenwriter Max Landis and DJ Edith Bowman are among those to welcome the new promo on Twitter.\\nUS publication Entertainment Weekly, meanwhile, has assembled a frame-by-frame analysis.\\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story will be released in the UK on 16 December.\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.', 'Officers had appealed for information after it was alleged a 25-year-old was threatened with a weapon and sexually assaulted by another man on Brooms Road in the early hours of Sunday.\\nAfter checking CCTV and taking witness statements, police were \"satisfied no criminality has taken place\".\\nThey said they were no longer looking for a suspect.\\nDet Insp Bryan Lee said: \"I would like to thank the public for their excellent response to our appeals for information and reassure them they can go about their normal routine.\\n\"Our additional patrols in the area will now also return to normal levels.\"', 'Seven photographs taken in the Norfolk countryside by photographer Josh Olins will appear in the June edition.\\nIn her first sitting for a magazine, the duchess is seen looking relaxed and wearing casual clothes.\\nThe shoot was in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, where two images are being displayed in the Vogue 100: A Century of Style exhibition.\\nThe duchess, who has a keen interest in photography, has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery since 2012.\\nNicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, said: \"Josh has captured the duchess exactly as she is -

as an ice hockey rink needs to be laid at midnight for a match at the same Hallenstadion venue the following day.\\nBut what else do you need to know?\\nBBC Radio 5 live\\'s sports news correspondent Richard Conway explains.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nFifa\\'s 209 nations will gather in Zurich for what is billed as an \"extraordinary congress\".\\nIt was called after Sepp Blatter dramatically announced last June that he would step aside after 18 years as Fifa president.\\nThe 79-year-old Swiss said he was \"laying down his mandate\", which has led to some concern he may not have actually resigned.\\nHowever, Fifa officials are confident he will not make an awkward re-appearance - not least because he has been banned from football for eight years over a \"disloyal payment\" of £1.3m to suspended Uefa president Michel Platini.\\nBoth men deny wrongdoing and are appealing against their bans.\\nBlatter also has no accreditation to get into the conference hall on the outskirts of Zurich where the congress is being held.\\nThere are two big issues to settle.\\nFirst, the FA representatives have to agree to a package of reforms designed to eliminate the problems that have plunged Fifa into crisis in recent months and restore its reputation.\\nThen, if and when that is formalised, they have to appoint a new president.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nGiven the hype and spin around the election the reforms have been slightly forgotten about - but they are vitally important to the organisation\\'s future.\\nOne Fifa insider believes it would be a \"disaster\" if measures to clean up the governing body fail.\\nSpecifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries.\\nResponsibility for everyday business decisions will be removed from the \"political\" representatives of national associations.\\nThe \"executive committee\" will be disbanded. In its place will come a new 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women, to set global strategy.\\nThe day-to-day running of Fifa will pass to a new \"general secretariat\" - equivalent to a corporate executive board - and the secretary general, effectively the CEO, will be a powerful position.\\nThe checks and balances will be carried out by a series of committees, the most important of which will be the fully independent audit and compliance committee.\\nFifa wants the regional confederations and national associations to mirror their efforts over time and they will place immediate new demands on them, such as annual audits.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nYou would think so given Fifa\\'s recent history. However, officials aren\\'t taking any chances.\\nThe proposals need 75% approval to be passed.\\nActing president Issa Hayatou has been very active in spreading the message about the need to adopt the raft of proposals.\\nHayatou was censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal - where the sports marketing company paid $100m (£66.2m) to officials, including former Fifa president Joao Havelange and ex-Fifa executive Ricardo Teixeira, in return for lucrative television and marketing rights throughout the 1990s.\\nAdditionally, he has been accused of taking a $1.5m (£1.1m) bribe from Qatar to vote in favour of their bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Both he and Qatar categorically deny any wrongdoing.\\nSo it is of interest that Hayatou has been at the forefront of the reform efforts.\\nHayatou has an unassailable reputation (although not in Europe) amongst large sections of the 209 Fifa nations, despite his alleged wrongdoing. His voice carries weight amongst the \"family\" and the vote should therefore be carried without any issues.\\nFifa is still in a perilous position with ongoing American and Swiss investigations into the activities of current and former officials.\\nAs it stands, the organisation is considered a \"victim\" by the US Department of Justice. But that could change.\\nIf the DoJ believes Fifa is not reforming or is carrying on as usual then it could be charged under US racketeering laws designed initially to tackle organised crime.\\nPassing the reforms are therefore vital if Fifa is to continue operating and not be shut down.\\nYes. This is where it gets complicated.\\nThe DoJ and the Swiss authorities are very interested in how the Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cups were awarded and if any wrongdoing took place.\\nIf Fifa were to be shut down it could render the contracts for both those tournaments null and void.\\nGeopolitically that could cause huge friction, especially given the delicate military situation in Syria at the moment.\\nIn addition, the US is a big ally of Qatar and has a strategic air base there.\\nGiven all of this, many question whether there is the political will from President Barack Obama\\'s administration to carry out the ultimate threat. One insider said recently he believes there is pressure on Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney General, not to act in this regard.\\nFar from it.\\nIn December, when the US made its second wave of arrests, it issued a superseding indictment.\\nThere are 24 unnamed co-conspirators within the document, including high ranking Fifa officials and members of national FAs. Some may be cooperating with the US already, others not.\\nAt some stage the US will have to act and a grand jury has been sitting in the US to consider ongoing matters.\\nIn addition, the Swiss investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding process is ongoing. That enquiry has widened and has resulted in Blatter being criminally investigated.\\nBig question. No one knows right now.\\nIf they do take action, the effect that has on the election will depend largely on who is targeted and where. The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.\\nIt is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let\\'s not rule anything in or out just yet.\\nSheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.\\nHe has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.\\nHowever, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.\\nThe national associations do not want to back the loser either… even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.\\nFifa presidency: Meet Sepp Blatter\\'s five possible successors\\nWhat about GianniInfantino?\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss\\' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.\\nWell, yes… but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein\\'s failed election attempt last May.\\nBack then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.\\nSo their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.\\nInfantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.\\nThey also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it\\'s game over. He wins. \"If\" is the key word though.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nPrince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.\\nHe failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.\\nA safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.\\nThat means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.\\nFrenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.\\nSouth African businessman Tokyo Sexwale\\'s efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.\\nHe went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.\\nDespite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.\\nThere are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.\\nThat may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.\\nIn the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.\\nIf there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.\\nThe candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday\\'s congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.\\nIn theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.\\nFifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes. A safer bet is two hours, judging by previous elections.\\nSo the earliest a winner is likely to be declared is about 17:30 GMT… let\\'s see.', 'Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer.\\nAustrians like order, or \"Ordnung\" as they say in German.

I helped him remove a ring of bark around each of his aspen trees.\\nNot all the way around as that would kill the tree, but a strip about an inch wide round most of the trunk.\\nThe idea was to simulate a beaver attack on the tree, stressing the tree out and forcing it to produce flowers and then seeds.\\nWell this week I returned to see if the experiment had worked and an amazing sight greeted me, eight aspen trees all covered in catkins.

But is their defence really a problem?\\nOn the face of it, the statistics suggest it is. No team has made more errors that have led to goals than Liverpool since 2012, while the Reds have not managed to concede fewer than 40 goals a season since 2009-10.\\nA concern, no doubt, for a side with title ambitions. Only once in the past seven seasons has the Premier League been won by a side that has shipped 40 goals or more - Manchester United in 2012-13 (43).\\nHowever, things appear to be going in the right direction under Klopp. Liverpool conceded eight fewer goals last season than they did in the German\\'s first at Anfield, while Saturday\\'s result against Palace was a fifth clean sheet from their past six Premier League games, as many as in the previous 21.\\nThe run of four clean sheets in Liverpool\\'s final four games of last season came with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren in the side. When they are able to start together, Liverpool are generally rock solid at the back - of the 18 league games they started last season, the Reds lost just once and kept eight clean sheets.\\nPossession football. Two words that will have Arsenal fans shuddering.\\nThe Gunners often come out on top of the possession statistics but their game at Stoke on Saturday perhaps took the biscuit. With 77.3%, Arsene Wenger\\'s side \\'enjoyed\\' their highest possession figure in a single Premier League match since the 2003-04 season - yet lost 1-0.\\nIt was a similar story for Tottenham. Against Chelsea in their first Premier League home game at Wembley, they threw everything (possibly including the kitchen sink) at the opposition goal, dominating the possession statistics with 68% of the ball - but ended up on the wrong side of a 2-1 result.\\nClearly Chelsea were taking a leaf out of Burnley\\'s books. Last weekend, the Clarets had just 38% possession compared with 62% for the Blues, but came away with the victory.\\nJavier Hernandez did what Javier Hernandez does best on Saturday - score from inside the box.\\nThe former Manchester United striker returned to English football by joining West Ham in the summer and scored in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014 with a brace against Southampton. Just like his strike against Newcastle 1,232 days ago, both of those goals came from within 18 yards.\\nIn fact, not one of Hernandez\\'s 39 goals in the Premier League have been scored from outside the area, making him one of the most lethal close-range finishers to have played in England\\'s top flight.\\nHernandez\\'s failure to score from outside of the box is not for the want of trying.\\nAgainst Southampton, the Mexico international had three shots on goal. Two from inside the box which ended up in the back of the net, the other from long range which, you\\'ve guessed it, went wide.\\nThe fox in the box is very much in style. Of the 50 goals scored in the Premier League so far this season, only four have come from outside the area.\\nLife just continues to get better and better for Huddersfield fans.\\nThe Terriers, back in the big time after a 45-year absence, made it two wins from two in the Premier League by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Sunday.\\nIt means they are now only the third team in Premier League history to win their first two games following promotion. Bolton, in 2001-02, went to finish 16th and earn another stint in the top flight - but Hull City last season would go on to be relegated.

They imagine this as a tube sitting around the solid inner core, running along Earth’s rotation axis.\\nWhen liquid iron approaches the boundary from both sides, it gets squeezed out sideways to form the jet, which then hugs the imaginary tube.\\n\"Of course, you need a force to move fluid towards the tangent cylinder,\" said Prof Rainer Hollerbach, also from Leeds and another co-author on the paper.\\n\"This could be provided by buoyancy, or perhaps more likely from changes in the magnetic field within the core.\"\\nAlthough the team believes it understands how wide and how long the jet is, the depth to which it descends is far from certain.\\nDr Livermore told BBC News: \"It currently wraps about 180 degrees around the tangent cylinder.  Although observations only constrain the jet stream on the edge of the core, our theoretical understanding suggests that the jet could in principle go very deep indeed - possibly in fact all the way down to the edge of the core in the southern hemisphere (i.e. at the other end of the tangent cylinder).\"\\nThat the team can make such inferences speaks to the impressive capabilities of the Swarm constellation.\\nLaunched in November 2013, the European Space Agency satellites are providing unparalleled insights into the structure and behaviour of Earth\\'s magnetic field.\\nWith their highly sensitive instruments, they are gradually teasing apart the field\\'s various components - from the dominant signal coming from the movement of iron in the outer core to the almost imperceptible contribution made by ocean currents.\\nIt is  hoped the Swarm satellites’ data could ultimately tell us why Earth’s magnetic field has been weakening in recent centuries.\\nScientists have speculated we could be on the cusp of a polarity reversal, which would see North become South, and South become North.\\nThis occurs every few hundred thousand years.\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos', 'summary': 'Scientists say they have identified a remarkable new feature in Earth’s molten outer core.', 'id': '38372342', 'input_ids': [21603, 10, 328, 5530, 34, 38, 3, 9, 773, 13, 96, 9245, 6093, 121, 3, 18, 3, 9, 1006, 18, 7631, 53, 4033, 13, 4400, 3575, 24, 19, 244, 3896, 4653, 2239, 7, 365, 12821, 11, 925, 115, 4476, 5, 37, 1], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'labels': [21166, 7, 497, 79, 43, 4313, 3, 9, 8562, 126, 1451, 16, 4030, 22, 7, 3, 4641, 324, 12231, 2583, 5, 1]}\n",

The US is believed to be diverting its attention away from America and more towards Europe, Asia and Africa.\\nIt is hard to see the mechanism by which the election could be stopped - but this is Fifa, so let\\'s not rule anything in or out just yet.\\nSheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain is still the front runner according to many observers.\\nHe has the backing of his own Asian confederation and Africa, though the continents do not vote as a bloc and the ballot is held in secret.\\nHowever, such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated.\\nThe national associations do not want to back the loser either… even though the vote is secret. There may be big swings in the vote between the rounds.\\nFifa presidency: Meet Sepp Blatter\\'s five possible successors\\nWhat about GianniInfantino?\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe Uefa general secretary Infantino has, according to the 45-year-old Swiss\\' camp, made gains in recent weeks. They believe he is the man to beat.\\nWell, yes… but this is the same PR team behind Prince Ali bin al-Hussein\\'s failed election attempt last May.\\nBack then they made very different noises in the build-up, briefing that 40-year-old Jordanian Prince Ali was unlikely to win but would give Blatter a bloody nose.\\nSo their bullish confidence with Infantino should not be underestimated.\\nInfantino has strong support in Europe, South America and significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean.\\nThey also think they will get half the votes in Africa. If that proves true then it\\'s game over. He wins. \"If\" is the key word though.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nPrince Ali lost the support of Europe for this election when Platini announced he was standing.\\nHe failed to make gains after the 60-year-old former France captain was banned and Infantino stepped into his shoes.\\nA safe prediction for Prince Ali would be that he has between 20 and 30 pledges of support.\\nThat means he simply cannot win - but he could be a significant player in deciding the eventual victor if he drops out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate.\\nFrenchman Jerome Champagne will stay on to the bitter end but is highly unlikely to get more than 10 votes.\\nSouth African businessman Tokyo Sexwale\\'s efforts have been something of a mystery and he has been criticised for running a lacklustre campaign.\\nHe went on a joint visit to Robben Island, where he was a political prisoner, with Infantino on Monday.\\nDespite that he says he will not quit. He seems to be playing a longer game - perhaps with his eye on a new Fifa if the current organisation is ever abolished.\\nThere are 207 eligible voters, with Kuwait and Indonesia currently barred from taking part.\\nThat may change on Friday and the total number of voters will be announced before the ballot.\\nIn the first round, the winner needs two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that then a simple majority (105 in a 209-nation contest) is all that is required to win.\\nIf there is still no winner then a third round will take place and the candidate with the fewest votes in round two would drop out at this point.\\nThe candidates will each have 15 minutes to address Friday\\'s congress, which is due to start at about 12:00 GMT.\\nIn theory, the first round of voting should start at approximately 13:30 GMT.\\nFifa estimates each round of voting will take one hour and 40 minutes. A safer bet is two hours, judging by previous elections.\\nSo the earliest a winner is likely to be declared is about 17:30 GMT… let\\'s see.', 'summary': \"Football's crisis-hit world governing body Fifa will meet in Zurich on Friday and elect a new leader to try to take the damaged organisation forward into a new era.\", 'id': '35646843', 'input_ids': [21603, 10, 3159, 577, 1549, 19, 59, 3510, 30, 48, 1407, 71, 4668, 398, 36, 10126, 30, 8, 706, 3, 18, 38, 46, 3, 867, 16528, 3, 13419, 523, 12, 36, 7245, 44, 17633, 21, 3, 9, 1588, 44, 8, 337, 1], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'labels': [10929, 31, 7, 5362, 18, 10536, 296, 3, 19585, 643, 377, 99, 9, 56, 942, 16, 11688, 362, 30, 1701, 11, 11924, 3, 9, 126, 2488, 12, 653, 12, 240, 8, 6780, 5102, 1039, 139, 3, 9, 126, 3, 1498, 5, 1]}\n",
